I'm 6100 shares deep in PLTR: 4100 in my Roth IRA and 2000 in the taxable.  Please Daddy Karp, play up the company and how awesome your earnings reports are.

I expect PLTR to do a marvelous pivot into some sort of consumer facing product that just blows them up so hard.  I have a feeling that might be why they needed the money from the direct listing, but I don't know that for certain.  Total speculation on my part.
I got CVS in June and hoping they print down rn but I'm a 💎 🧤

In the case of a stimmy that provides cash to everyone, inflation hurts those that have the most since their mass of dollars is less valuable. 

If everyone gets $2K, then everyone benefits equally from stimulus. Inflation impacts those who hold the most cash disproportionately.
Where do you guys normally check futures?
Made money, what does that mean and where do I acquire one of those ?
Prices are up for Q4 sales by approx 20%. Another major increase will be announced very soon - January 8th at the latest. My guess is it comes earlier. Q1 prices are already up as, most mills are now taking May/June futures without prices. It will be “price time of shipment”.  You are simply giving a purchase order that has no price and letting them tell you the price months from now. . .this is just securing a place in line.
Everyone with BABA calls are worried; I'm sitting here with puts and worried about those. I have a feeling this is just the pullback for the slingshot

I bought 1 leap call for June 2022. I think I should have gotten shares instead since GILD pays a dividend. I'm down like 20% on it haha. 

That said, my rationale for doing it was their HIV franchise continues to be strong, and they acquired or did deals with a few really interesting cancer IO companies that may pay off in the future (Immunomedics, Tizona, Arcus, Forty Seven...I'm a big fan of the last 3 I listed). They also did a few deals in the CAR-T space that I personally don't love but the market sometimes gets super excited about it (Kite, Jounce, Allogene). 

I don't think any of the COVID plays matter for GILD. It won't make big money and become a major franchise to move the needle on a such a large organization. The cancer IO stuff has potential though.

I still prefer a lot of other biotech companies over GILD.

Dude, it's part of the game on this subreddit. Being a dick is part of the persona of it all. Don't be thin-skinned around here, it's not personal, and sorry if you're new to this sub. 

A short-squeeze occurs when the amount of shorts on a stock surpasses the float of that stock. In the case of GME, the shorts are hilariously outpacing the stock float. When those short positions have to be closed every share in the float will be bought driving up the price to outlandish levels. It could reach as high as $150 a share if the squeeze happens quickly and violently. More likely however is a slow squeeze with the stock capping out somewhere between $50 and $100. The numbers are imprecise because it's impossible to predict what exactly will happen. But it could mean big money. Buy shares of GME if you feel like gambling.
So impossible and the group that owns BK, nice

Takes a while to write 5 thousand pages
Buy NIO spread for 1/8. Easy 135% gains.
I was almost asleep till I read this LFG! 🚀🚀🚀🚀

It’s a reverse merger with a lot of moving parts.
From what I have learned most SPACS get investigated, but this one is under investigation for misleading information. STIC is only going to retain 12.5% equity once the merger takes place. Do research before you buy. Very likely a PnD.
Much experience with that do you?
I'm too rich. I ain't getting shit cos I'm over the income limit
So much gold in GME is spilling over to this thread XD

MSFT, AAPL, SPY, and yeah the ARK's
[this shit cracks me up](https://imgur.com/jIKIezv). Sick buddy so motivational and original, im never buying anything again
I work with/for a lot of very wealthy people.  There is no correlation between being rich and being happy.  I wouldn't say rich people are all assholes, but certainly no less quantity than those without money.  Money buys things and opportunity but if you don't know who you are or how to use it, then it certainly won't make you happier.  I use to dream of wealth, now I have a little money and dream of playing video games on a tattered couch with the homies, smoking a bowl, and eating Mexican food.   Days gone by...
Well, got on the pltr train right before it fell off. Was cheering for that guy to eat his sh--. So went big on 40c.

Boeing has screwed me every time. Either got out to early or held to 0. Ive never timed BA right.

That said if AAPL hits 150 by some miracle I'm able to at least tell my mom I broke even.
Tickers?
How TF did you know about KODK and buy in b4 lol
If only there were a cross border store of wealth
What are you?  A gay fish?
Etsy too. Got an email that someone started following my old shop lol.
I plan on pumping and dumping SPACs tax free
Man I had to go to the very bottom? Thought it was Jeff Bridges at first

Yes

I've got long 2022 calls. I think that's the way to go over shares just because of how volatile it is. I'm hoping we hear some crazy shit like Amazon buying them or something like that, but we'll see.

"trade the tendy stocks"
QS has been crazy, that tiny pullback trapped a lot of shorts but also shook out some weak hands and gave people a chance to get in. Think we may see another squeeze before it has a significant pull back. Now with more stimulus passed things are gonna get crazy again over the next couple months... 

AMZN needs to do a Damn split ASAP. Look what it’s done for TSLA & APPL... Elon and Bezo’s are on pace to be the first Trillionaires but I think Bezo’s will do it first But I don’t think it’ll hit $10k a share , he should’ve done a split months ago. Reduce downside risk and give us some more upside man ! Everybody wants in , but not everyone has $3.5k to throw in during a pandemic especially when you have stocks like APPL & TSLA around the same market cap for a fraction of the price. Even stocks like QS & FUBO , running 300%+ in 2 months...

This thread is pure comedy. **LOL**

You can't take his "analysis" seriously. He is comparing **Apples to Oranges**. 

$**AAPL's** business and $**TSLA's** are very different. It is expected that they will compete in the EV space, but both entities have other businesses where they aren't competitors at all. Their strategies might turn out to be different, as well. In fact, I expect that to be the case.
Love the DD, going to buy a few calls in SOYB this week. probably gonna loose a bunch of stuff but you had lots of paragraphs and fancy pictures soooo

THIS IS THE WAY
Haha. Rocket ship. You must be a rocket scientist. This is the way.
So, large gap up at open then slow decline back to red? I'll buy SPY puts in the morning
[deleted]
Hell yeah. People who don’t game and haven’t shopped at GME don’t usually get it. It’s the same magical feeling when your weeklies go deep ITM, but it happens when you get a half a dozen games and a couple collectibles you just found out you needed while at your local GME. I’m in stock and some debit spreads.
Maybe for the short term. No way chinese will do anything drastic for their top company in the country

“Retard” is a compliment here. I was just stating my position. I’ll bet on anything. And I always give my DD. Don’t hate the player, hate the game.

I think used games is a compelling case. But a perhaps exaggerated case against used game sale over long period of time is its equivalent, Blockbuster, except it makes profit on used movie disc and rental. I don’t see why eBay, Amazon, or BestBuy can’t do the exact same thing. If I were running GME, I would learn from Netflix to offer some kind of game subscription across platforms. Innovate or die

Yeah basically you're paying a 30% premium right now for an escrow account holding $20/share in cash, in hopes that the stock price goes up further if Ackman gets an exciting target for a merger.

AirBnB, Bloomberg, and Stripe are already ruled out, even though OP is continuing to lie and say that they aren't because he's an asshole pumper trying to further inflate an already 30% over value position.
I got 3000 shares of PLTR at $10.87. Sold out at $28.24.  Happy 45 days right there.

If Berkshire Hathaway $BRK-B was valued at the same P/Book as Apple $AAPL they would be valued at $14.1 trillion.  (1.29 vs 34.29) 

That would make them the richest company in the world. Massive bull case.

Berkshire Hathaway has a market cap of $531.5 billion, and owns $109.35 billion of AAPL.

Yes I don’t want it
It just dropped 14%.  The easy money and hype from the spac is gone.  Good luck.  It's probably going to settle back around $20.
Don't expect spy to ever go below 360 as no one wants to sell in this market especially with Biden super stimulus in the horizon and more vaccine pumps.

I thought I was Buffett after I hit a 20 bagger like 2 months in but then I lost it all so ever since I accept that i am a retard

I think sub 220 is a great price for shares. It certainly could go below 200 but I don't want to risk it if it doesn't. I think it's an over reaction given it's going negative on the year now.
Buy 20k worth of PS5s, sell for 25k, put it all on 75c XL with expiry this week, lose 25k, profit

Yeah you should. Most likely its nothing, but better safe than sorry.

It’s 7.75 HKD in $1, so take the price and divide by 7.75

There’s also 8 x the shares listed in HK, so then multiply by 8

I don’t remember if there’s 8 times the shares because of a past split or what, but that’s the math

Accompanied by jerking or no jerking?
Theta is the cost per contract per day x 100. 
So basically you’re paying 9.95 to run the contract each day

500
80k yearly translates to ~6.5k monthly. The rule of thumb is to not exceed ~30% of that on mortgage payments, so that gives you ~2k monthly. If you can put a good chunk down (say 10-12%), at current interest rates, you should look for something in the 500s. You have a fair number of those available right now, so best of luck - https://www.redfin.com/city/12345/NJ/Morristown/filter/max-price=600k?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=ppc&utm_term=kwd-76828569469436:loc-114002&utm_content=76828516894197&utm_campaign=1025817

If the company doesn't merge with a company, common shares are worth 9.50. Warrants are worth 0. You are exposing yourself to much higher risk with warrants.

HK follows US market correct? This is a correction to US levels Or is it an additional fall? I could care less, BABA and China can burn, but it’s fun to watch

I just manage my girlfriends trading account and I even setup her 401k this year in March.

Her company required her to talk to some advisor and I was on the phone with her getting her away from the higher expense ratios he was trying to steer her into or other bs ETF's. She was like my boyfriend says you're wrong and not to do that which pissed off the guy who then started talking to me and then tried to tell me that REITS would be coming back strong. I laughed and put her all into the heaviest tech ETF's her company was offering.
Why not both? I have both. I have way more in shares though.
If BABA keeps dipping just keep going balls deep for July 2021 and thank me later after they get a slap on the wrist and rebound to 300

And how are u so sure it will ?

[deleted]
What kind of trade did you do ?
Hope to roll over round 4 tn an see baba up 3% at least
Yes. 2 calls
BABA is down less than 1%. 

Convert the price by multiplying x 8 and dividing by 7.75. Or multiply the price x 1.0322. Arbitrage. 

HK BABA 213 = US BABA $220

I don’t know why I explained this again. I am so fucking pumped for tomorrow. SPACs are the way.
If Melvin Capital purchased calls when the stock was very low as insurance, they could exercise the options and be out of there position
BABA CALLS IT IS YOU PHAGGS!
all this panic for BABA to be green tomorrow
But there is no guarantee it'll drop so buy enough to be happy and keep some capital in case it drops to "buy the dip fagot"
But like, just buy a few shares. Not enough volume to raise the price. Do it with an algorithm / automated way. Buy what you can while it's undervalued until it's not anymore? Or I guess maybe you could try to not raise attention to it for now until you are able to trade volume. Yea, nvm that makes sense I think.

Dude, can you even tell where Tesla, Amazon, Netflix etc will be in a decade, let alone GameSpot? Could you tell in 2010 what these companies would be in 2020? The play with GME is short term, next 2 yrs or so. The thesis is that it is valued as if it will be bankrupt in 2021, which is clearly not true.

Taxes in NJ are broken high. I own 2 homes and pay 13000/year on 1 and 10000/year on the other. They are in northern NJ 20 minutes from NYC so good locations
I think even if I get rich, I will still be unhappy. There’s something else I seek and I need to figure it sooner than later
Maybe buying a stock after a 20% drop in a day isn't a great idea until you see if its gonna drop further....just brainstorming here I dunno

There the same thing
[deleted]
why the fuck was it ever a thing?
Let me google that for you: https://ark-invest.com/subscribe/
yeah true, lots of upside to renting tho. no tax, no maintenance, no risk of holding an underwater mortgage when this shitshow goes tits up. Instead of being on WSB you'll be renovating the kitchen or fixing the roof. owning a house is endless work. All good if the market continues to go up but will we really go another 20/30 years without a 2008 style correction? risky to grab a mortgage now.
BTFD
But did I only get a measly $600 or a whopping $2000?! Margin needs to know.

Ok boomer
the 3500 calls were $1.6 ...  if amzn releases some bombass numbers and it goes to 3350 those will likely double. never a bad bet to get in them bad boys after christmas.
There’s so many quiet PLTR holders In here. When ever there’s a little spike they all come out full fucking force
Whole share is so 1999. We are now fractional.
Stop
Sorry about the botched eye surgery
[deleted]
Alright putting the entire $600 into GME calls. Edit: I am poor
Just fucking chill on BABA, wait til it bottoms out. Plenty of long opportunities right now, BABA will still be a good one at $240
Were or are. That's why everyone has an opinion. Some of us have been hurt, others will know the pain soon.

Any good stocks that you guys are looking at?

I'm currently looking at AMC. They're on a down-trend, but I could see them going up once Covid starts to die down, if they actually survive. I thought about them because I'd like to go to the movies.
if you have shares you are fine

if you have fds you are fucked
Is ICLN 30c for Feb 2021 gonna print 🥺👉👈
Yes. About 10 years away in my mid 40's
Yes. It can go below 20, that is just what it’s redeemable at if no merger goes through.  The likelihood in this market of it going below $20 seems very low, but who knows (I’m no gay bear)

So saying this is zero risk is a lie, but the risk reward is pretty good. 

If you need all that money for a down payment for sure (ie already have the mortgage and need it on close/possession) maybe do half just in case. If you are just planning to buy then do it all.

I had no money to invest in March.  Now I make like 10 grand a week and all these bears are talking bubble.

Breaking News In China:

熊性交
Although I agree with you, it’s not like futures are only up off this news. Markets just want to go up
The entire Gamefly team as well
I think it trades choppy, but bearish-leaning for a few months. China is investigating Ma, so they'll try to dig up whatever they can on him to hang over his head until he tows the party line. Investigation can be a few months, based off of what they've done in the past.

What are your guys option calls for GME. Currently I'm at 30c Nov. Do you guys think it's a good call? Any suggestions
used to think that shit was a good investment then realized you could just yolo into any random call and make back 10x that money in one day instead
I've owned it since it was $78. I'm struggling with what to do. Made money on puts Th. Think it might be time to say, "goodnight, sweet prince"
PLTR ATH TOMORROW. Then slow bleed back down under $30 by EOW lol.
You're handsome
And... its gone
how are you doing?
Definitely not lifted for most of them.

They will usually release holiday press releases after Christmas. All the links you can see online, dec 26th they released in 2018, dec 26th in 2019. So they will most probably release tomo
Don't let it get you down. Fire up the engine and lose the rest!
I genuinely can't tell. Can you? I mean, it's funny but what's the punchline?
The bump will be a 0.2% drop instead of the usual 0.6%
Options are scary
Same.  I've been watching the 4/21 200c and 1/22 225c hoping they dip to .20 or even .10 cents.  If .10 you almost can't lose, I'd put 50k on it. But doubt we'd ever see that.  So true that no love.  Their Yahoo page is DEAD!  Crazy for big company with so many catalyst around.
Excuse me Earthman, this is a casino

I thought he was down 1k. We all thought different shit. My point was that his stop loss is irrelevant because he’s going to reach it, so he might as well never reach it.
I'm averaging in. buying more if it goes down more over the next month.

Not a bad idea to go long on baba. Its a solid company, but you will have to hold onto it for a long time
Well thats a wrap on ole jakey.

As a Packers fan I'm all for Aaron Rodgers getting the love.  But Davante Adams should be the league's MVP.  Nobody has been able to cover him.
Bro I promise if I knew I would tell you
Ask if they have a finger you can suck on
If you are convinced it will eat shit for a while sell an OTM call against your position. Repeat each month to bring in some funds while you wai for it to turn around
I still don’t get how you people keep sneaking covert video cameras into my bedroom in my mom’s basement like all the time
Wild. Lucky Jakey. What kind of shit head friends just go home after they don’t find him lol
I second this
GME IS GONNA FUCKING LAUNCH THIS WEEK
Meaning they don’t trade the same numeric value. 1 US share is equivalent to 8 HK shares. And 1 USD ≠ HKD. It’s like a 3% difference when you do the arithmetic, with HK nominal price lower than US price.

Tbf it's hard to buy into BABA the moment Ants is under scrutiny from regulators.
I just read this on Chinese social media:

熊性交
Prolly had BABA calls
I addressed this above. Trump invoked the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 while signing the Covid relief bill, which redlines certain areas of the bill, requires them to be addressed, or else his signature is moot (and no one gets their stimulus).
Lol
BABA is high-risk high reward, ie the perfect original WSB play and not garbage that gets pumped here at ATH constantly. I personally am not playing it anymore but I can understand the thesis for BABA bulls.

To be fair we are just at the beginning of a seismic shift in technology that could go on for a few decades or even longer, not too late to get in the game.
Just had a drive by shooting a mile from my house an hour ago. These stimulus celebrations are getting weird.
Is this week the bottom for baba? I’m fomoing so bad on getting in, I feel like it’s all for show and they’ll reach a deal with China. They’re so dominate in what/where they do. I wanna go long
Damn it never dips. Time to make it crash once I buy some calls!

Kinda defeats the purpose if there is no bad news
Josh Allen will win us the ship
Could be still. Bill can still be amended or passed as stand alone. Still, quite unlikely
Long? The reality is that anything under $500 is a good buy on BABA. 

People will look back on this moment in investment history and either reminisce on how they came up or how they missed the boat and are still turning tricks behind Wendy’s.
This is funny
Scenario:

BABA crashes so hard, it scares everyone out of Chinese markets en masse, pulling us down with them. SPY opens at $7.
Trump’s signature on the govt funding/Covid relief bill is contingent upon the revocation or vast reformation of 230. If 230 is revoked, TWTR and FB are both fucked, Politics be damned.

Yeah I got into CCI right before it melted down every day for the last 3 weeks, theres just no love for them rn but the Dish network deal is uuge
imagine thinking countertrading wsb sentiment on BABA when the only thing that matters is what Xi is thinking and what Chinese social media is discussing

Great question, I think you have to look at the bigger picture. If the CCP outright bans Alibaba they might be worth zero but I think the $80 range would be to horde up as many shares as you can.

How do I see what BABA is trading at on the gyna market?
So no 2k stimulus..?
Brickell bro let's fucking go
It was signed, but Trump also apparently invoked the “Impoundment Control Act of 1974” while signing the bill, which allows him to redline areas he thinks must be addressed. This sends it back to congress. The revocation or vast reformation of 230 is one of the red lines, and congress must address this otherwise Trump’s signature on the bill is moot. It’s truly dizzying what is happening here.
[deleted]
I rest my case
Powerful DD
fuck, BABA again, disappointing its shareholders again. Jack Ma is a cunt holyfuck. He just can't shut up lol. I'm happy I sold a long time ago. But I feel bad for BABA holders, its like being stuck in a toxic relationship
self medicate
true, though he says that money is petty cash for him later into it.
Average down tomorrow !
WSB has rules against it for good reason, but it is a part of my investment story so I felt like I had to include it.
He never cared about getting anybody $2000. That was all a distraction from the pardons. If he actually was trying for $2000 he’s the weakest dealmaker ever.

What are they and how are they going to make money?
I gotta feeling that I need to start rotating back to cash soon.
It’s honesty lol, there’s rarely a person in here that doesn’t perpetuate survivorship bias.
That 100+ is insane hyperbole by that guy. I don't expect psth to pop until loi, but it's already up so much there's risk it goes down if people don't like the target.

I'm already up 25% in a couple months on psth and now I just sell calls. I that's the kind of return you'll get if you buy spngu day 1. With the added bonus of no risk it goes below $10 per share.
Congrats

Forgive the serious question but... 

I didn't have a windfall like you, but I do have far ITM calls expiring soon
and want to buy more shares. Is it better to exercise the call or close the call and roll the premium into another further call?

and for you paste eaters:
GME 🚀🚀🚀🌌🌑🌌
True. but it do make sense.... BRRR + stimmy + buy backs.....  it only takes 1 winner to win back all the loosers and one looser to win back  nuthing.
AMZN $3200 12/31
What kind of leverage you usin for that 2k to 3m😭
but today, buy the baba dip its free money
There are consequences to not paying down debt. It'll come around to the next generation
Couldn’t you do the buy puts and roll calls thing and really capitalize this?
You got this!!!!
Wait, WSB screaming to jump in BABA, now BABA burning
Imagine buying baba calls and then bragging all weekend on a gambling thread full of literal retards
I'm sorry to hear about the options.  People must not fully understand that company or something.

I'm definitely holding the shares long-term.  As long as the fundamentals keep up, I'm in it at least a few years.
Anything under $200

yeah if you put thought and time into it, the success rate goes wayyyy up. Women can generally see through it when it's a copy pasted message that can be scatter shot sent to everyone. But even then, the success rate is more than 0%. It's at least 1% or something. But I've never personally done it that way.
I bought 2900 shares @ 17.96

Goodnight WSB. Let tomorrow be a day of endless mooning for all and a lonely, miserable death for DASH
You are so next level retard its amazing.

You realize there has been news on ant getting buttfucked and prices are still plunging despite a increased buyback.

You realize Chinese investors are more intuned with Chinese stocks and there is no reason to follow US ticker on this. 

You realize there are less blue chips and hence other options in Asia markets and that baba in HK should be higher than baba in the US right?

I played up to JV so it was fun for me. Def slow at the beginning but it's so well written. Every character is a freaking main character in that show lmao

Lol... 41.65 

I warned yaaa (: 

Jk I don’t wish on anyone to lose money especially when they double down on short term calls like one guy said in here. But now with Stimulus coming, and all these extra shorts the squeeze is definitely coming.  It’ll be back at All-Time Highs in no time... GL
This, this is the way.

cheap NKLA calls at open.
I was wrong. This is a continuation. Hopefully it bounces off 211/212 for them as it did for us. It hit 212 and is now 212.6. I'll be watching until I force myself to get 3 hours of sleep. Good luck to us both that it begins to rise now

25% random SPAC shares, we don’t know what they are aquiring

25% GME weeklys, hedged with a single SQQQ share (GME is tech right?)

1 PLTR share (We gave up on it but want to be included if it moons)

24% ARKF (the cheapest ARK, this account has $1,000. Yes, I know we started with $10,000.)

25% BABA weeklys bought last monday. Currently down 89%. (It’s okay, BABA is “adjusting” it’l be green today... RIGHT?)
At which price does BABA become a good buy?  I’m being patient here
Yes
shhh no need to raise awareness while I have Apple calls

You are allowing your political views to cloud your investment strategy. Best to leave those at the door when it comes to investing. Look at George Soros for example.

So are we getting $2000 or $600? I’m so lost with the stimulus
Prediction: You’re going to lose a lot of money for the next six months whining about a casino as the value of every asset skyrockets due to 0% interest rates. Then you’ll finally have had enough, realize you made a mistake, and switch to calls just as rates start rising again and the market falls. 🥴
"hey ma...i need to borrow this knife "
Some of the big ones (Lil Baby, Yachty, Drake) definitely hold stock
That shits going to open at $200 at this rate. Bag holding at 265 😭
AAPL - yes, BABA - nah.
Luv u 2 bb
Your wife’s titties are not flat. But you might want to send us pictures to confirm that.

Why are you this guy anything? He clearly has no clue and he even states so?
You forgot to tell him to make you a sandwich while he’s at it
I wonder how long we have to hold the shares before they rebound to 250s again. Maybe a year?
What do you mean not amazing? That’s $500k in 3 years. I don’t get this fuckin sub
WF analyst said he expects TSLA to be the next AOL...
I've been browsing this sub for at least 3 years. I've outlasted most people.
Doubling down as well on BABA
I’m pretty sure most of us will be stimulating ourselves watching our calls fly again tomorrow 💦🍆🤤
I can't go any more in! That's all I have!

Wouldn't inflation mean that you shouldn't hold cash? since the dollars value would depreciate under inflation, holding cash is the absolute worst option. Stocks or assets like real-estate would be best, or it you're an actual tinfoil hat gold/silver would even be better.
Link?
It's like having a cheat code to the market.
Depends on your risk tolerance. Maybe go halvsies.
Bears on food stamps yet again
Are those the fucking default model s wheels mother fucker?
Yeah we don’t buy low and sell high here. Instead of buying when they’re low and beat down you should buy when they’re high. You really are autistic!!!
Any retard buying it before more clarity on changes the company will need to make is literally asking for loss porn karma
Why not just buy as much as you want at open?
In fairness the entire US stock market is a pump and dump.
What are yalls thoughts on YALE & ICLN?
Butter me up and call me a biscuit
Fun Fact: Enron partnered with Blockbuster in like 1999 to deliver streaming Netflix-style. In classic Enron fashion, they booked the $100 million deal as soon as it was announced. Of course, it never happened since it was 1999. 


Enron blamed Blockbuster.
Stay moving onto new stocks. It hurts to see people playing baba and msft etc. Momentum is the best investment. SPACs are it right now.

At that point, I'm in.

I did this, put all my cash into PSTH and a random selection of 20 other spacs (~600k 500 in PSTH). Am cash heavy because I’m getting a new house built and have only paid half of what I expect to in April. 

Though my cash is a lot higher than what I’ll need to pay so not as risky, IMO spacs are low risk right now and likely until March at the earliest.
I’m in a 110 leap, had July 85 and 90c’s cut at 100% and definitely shouldn’t have. Didn’t think it’d keep going with basically no pullback tho and I don’t do wsb 1000% gain chasing
Cheers B Boi, same to you
somewhere between $14 - $2000?
[removed]
$12
You'd be surprised how badly a lot of people game the system. Their are self employed people making bank who hire themselves through an S-Corp and then periodically lay themselves off a few months a year to collect unemployment WHILE still earning money for their S-Corp. Dirty games.
Anyone in CLDR and what are your positions?
If you were to have $20k to buy shares of one of these tomorrow which one?
Bitcoin is a rockstar. I made 20% since the markets closed trading it. We can talk about it just not the initials.
So GME shares or calls?
Probably?? Not too confident.

says BABA trading at 212.4 at HKG. What does that equal in USD?
Its AAPL dumbfuck
I'm ultimately bullish on BABA but do not buy it yet. This one is more complicated than just an antitrust investigation at the moment
This teaches you more than public high school about money.
The fed has a plan. They’re smarter than you and I. Just ride the wave.
doesn't matter. buy at the close and sell at the open.
Oh so that’s why the price is *consistantly dropping and has been for hours.*
The best DD I’ve seen on WSB yet. GME/PLTR to the moon 🚀🚀🌙💦🌈🐻
Get high and watch Soul. It's great. Plus there's a joke about trading in it.
Imagine buying puts. I’ll never understand some people
What BABA is truly worth doesn't fucking matter right now. How are you not getting that? The knife is still falling.

He did ask, but just like with the recent news of him asking for 2k checks it was all just lip service. Democrats were always down for more stimmy but Niche McConnel said best I can do is 500 bil. Trump shoulda worked on Liche if he actually wanted shit to pass.
Well, they're not just a hipster computer company anymore.
So I'm guessing GME calls at open will basically be priced in? I was looking at the June $35c but now I'll probably just start dumping into shares :/
I think it’s a 25k and above feature. I’m not sure as I’m above 25k and I had it day one automatically.

What was your strike?

It’s no longer about the investigation (in which FB is “cooperating), Trump’s signature on the government funding/Covid relief bill is apparently contingent upon Congress either revoking or vastly reforming 230.

In some cases it was my only income. The hourly rate got zeroed out on my pay check from taxes.
I mean if you did your DD, the companies you put your money in should have strong balance sheets. If you hold long enough and they aren’t some random penny stocks, yes they should go up in time.
BABA... fuck. wonder what my leaps will look like tomorrow. Are we buying this dip or nah?
I have $42,000 in shares and $8k in options ranging from $17.50 to $25 strikes from March to Dec 2021
Georgia is the only leverage there ever was for it tbh, and it's still up in the air. Trump had none.

The time to fight for it was 2 months ago when they were deadlocked over the original bill. The 11th hour nonsense wasn't going to get passed by Turtle Boy and the Repubs at this phase.
No one with a smoothness brain thinks the GOP is going to shell out another 1400 to the filthy peasants. 600 had to pass cause it’s bound to the spending bill that would shut us down otherwise. 

They’ll hem and haw and righteously pound the table and at the end of the day pour a cold one cause they tried gosh dang it. But the deficit. Sooo out of control. You understand.
so if i buy shares at the top am i just fucked unless it goes up again

RMG will gladly leave you in the dust
yes its been trading for 2 days. most people dont seriously invest in SPACs before they merge, they are mainly speculative pump & dumps.

again its been trading for 2 whole fucking days. big whoop. the $40 options were only added by the market makers on christmas eve. it really doesnt get much earlier than that.
me too... It's down another 6% now
Well, technically, you would be prouder if you bought puts, but not touching is still pretty good.

Started years ago with $100.  
   
Asked for a broker, a name was dropped, walked in the appointment with my flashy $100 and my can do attitude.   
I knew nothing, had read zero books and I think, the only reason the broker accepted my pitiful individual contract was because of the family holdings (though he upped his fee a lot).   
   
I was profitable immediately, put more in and grew quite a bit since.
A lot more bullish in here since they stopped providing free WiFi to bears in the food bank lines.

what about negative catalysts? This run on the stock market since May might be making you delusional. A company of Teslas size has a long way to fall with bad news in margins/sales/competition/etc but you are a buckeye fan it seems so what can I expect.

where do u guys check HK stock prices (for BABA etc.)?
Don’t know and don’t care 😎🇺🇸
Watch inside out. You will like it too.
TAN or ICLN?
I assume the reason that the Dec $25 puts trade at $7 (breakeven below NAV) is that some people think Ackman could do such a bad deal that it trades below $20 post de-SPAC? That seems incredibly unlikely.

Which expiry options are you looking at? June/Dec $25 calls are more than $5. Doesn't seem worth it vs common, although the capital outlay is much lower.

How do you decide between long-dated calls and stock?
nope
Ok, weird place for a serious question but do I exercise my 13.5 12/31 calls if I want to buy shares or do I close it and buy maybe 50 shares at market and a further call?

They do hot deals on preowned games. Their buy one get one deals literally save you hundreds. Easier to return used games compared to Walmart, target, or best buy. If you’re a pro member, they also give you $5 a month (+ $10 straight up to sign up for a total of $70) for only $15. They also have better sales, for example switch and PS4 games were $5-$10 cheaper on Black Friday compared to other retailers.
How low is BABA going ? Asking for my lotto puts
Yup. Been doing the slow and steady portfolio build. Only about 200K in unrealized gains right now, but same boat, 500-1000$ every paycheck going in to the market. Gonna keep on going!

You’re avoiding a future expense by paying down principle earlier. I believe he said he was in for a 14% interest rate (which is kind of fucked in the land of free money, but I guess RH gotta eat too aside from just front running saps trades). So hypothetically if he owed $100, if he paid it off tomorrow he’d be out $100. If he paid it off 1 year from now, he’d be out $114 (simplifying with no compounding) so he actually had a 14% return on the early payoff transaction ((114-100)/100).

This is why I don’t care about paying off my mortgage early (3% return) vs. goofing in the market where my goal is >10% return.

Fair enough. Although as long as they're in the green the swings don't really bother me. But what are the odds? How likely is it that in falls below the current price ~26$? And at 83% IV, it seems likely that it will only increase

Have you actually read these articles? You couldn’t really ask for more evidence of a buyout. If there was any more evidence the buyout would be public knowledge and it would be 80+ already. And GripRoom was created on December 7th 2020.

Have no clue why since anyone who may have exercised them basically would have lost money due to the premiums, but whatever. I’m now holding 800 shares and will probably hold til EOW unless it starts pulling a BABA in the morning. Really don’t like this Chinese shit long term, though.
Will Citron announce it was a typo on XL and PT is actually $6?
What color lambo y'all buying after tomorrow?
Are PLTR bag holders worse than NKLA bag holders?

Woah what spot you go to? Hook it up with the addy
It doesn’t appear so but as soon as you cut losses it will
I don't think they are, I know they are.
sell BABA calls for loss tomorrow or hold?

I have $225C expiring 02/19
Bruce = 2020 autist of the year
I, along with most everyone else am optimistic about tomorrow and I’m seeing fomo posts.

Be careful, I can say from painful personal experience it’s most likely a bad idea to buy calls at open, do it around 0930 dip. 

Seen a lot of green at open turn flat through the rest of the day I don’t want y’all paying too much for your retardedly otm options

How much house can i afford on 80k a year here in NJ? Hoping that WSB helps me with a downpayment to put down on a house next year.
Go really long on baba. Still has some dropping to do
How come this fucker in the mirror is always making eye contact with me
Can someone give me a $500 yolo?
Can anyone tell me what the fuck happened to the $BB crowd, here i am with 200 shares and my dick in my hand fresh out of viagra...
If a september-type drop happeend again now I'd be in trouble. fully margined to the hilt and lots of long exposure via leaps.

Because if you have mortgage debt you can easily get out of it by downsizing or even simply talking away and losing your equity. 

You can't do that with other debt.

Not close enough for ya ? What do you suggest to buy tomorrow?
Yeah but the news came out on Thursday and HK market started reacting then.

Today is just a continuation.

You have shares, so you're fine. If you had calls in the near term...oof.

I'm hoping for a nice lil dip to \~190-200 and then gonna go into 2022 $300 callls and some shares.
Okay okay we get the joke you've posted it like a hundred times in the last hour
got $7K to mess around with & i’m looking at: PLTR, ICLN, ARKK, AAPL

thoughts?
But if there isn’t any supply won’t most of their console sales come in January-March?
I know sum 1 if you’re ok with incest
Not yet. There will be another slight dip, but the major breakout will come with the $2000 stimi, and that will be the time to go full 🌈🐻. Dont close those call positions early because buying the rumor to sell the news means you bought the $2000 rumor and now you’re waiting for that news.
So, you still get $600 in the meantime and they can argue and vote on the $2,000 tomorrow

Here's what I like to do. Buy some shares and some far out expiration ITM calls. If it starts to dip sell some shares for more calls. If it goes up hard, sell a couple calls and go back in some shares.

green monday for CLDR and SPAC orgasms please (tuscan, fiii, bft, etc)

Feeling good about the green monday w stimmy. Hope that my eggs are in the right basket though. It's gonna be IWM that goes up, probably...hoping that tech goes supernova, though.
 What will be total share dilution if, for simplicity sake, we take 10% of a 40 billion dollar valued company with 4 billion from SPAC? 200,000,000 shares from PSTH + warrants from 44,444,444 PSTH.WS + ?
probably high
Yes, gets down on paper who is against. Take results public before Georgia run off
Going bankrupt
It's doesn't technically contradict tho since the reason why Baba just died in the first place is that their government was up Jack Ma's asses
They are going to vote on 2000 again so we can keep getting a stimulus talks going well headline and not a sell the news event
This is the way

Stop right now. Look out the window and tell me the status of PLTR.
What the...
Fair
Long term, I'm bullish, short term, I'm leaning bearish. We'll likely see a drop. We're going to see drops like what happened on the 18th, even though most of it occurred premarket. It's inevitable and the higher the market goes without a decent pull back, the bigger the drop is going to be later on. It happens over and over again. 

Pull backs are necessary and will happen.

Haha. I don’t have time to go into that tonight. In short, if you are talking about Ackman’s holding company, it’s a very interesting play. It’s trading at a huge premium and when this deal goes through he will capture 6% of the spac. Plus the other insane moves he made in the spring.PSTH doesn’t come with the baggage of an entire hedge fund though, and offers a more direct entry to the heights of the spac.

We always think we've learned our lessons on the way back up. Then as we plummet back down we remember that we're still in fact retarded.

Again, my personal view is something like an 80/20 share/option spread. If you did 50/50 I would not discount you. If you really wanted to yolo, 25/75 is justifiable imo. It’s just harder to deal with emotionally. I’ve lost no sleep with the thousands of commons I have now. Haven’t contemplated selling any of it even when it was up 10%. To each their own. You gotta evaluate what’s going to make most sense for you. A lot of people fail to assess the “cost” that the mental toll options can take on you. If you are constantly under stress because you have so much on the line in options, you are likely to make other mistakes. Keep that in mind. Stay healthy and wealthy, amigo.

Search GME in this sub, change the sorting for top rated, and read the DD. this company can easily break $100 per share on fundamentals alone with Cohen's involvement, and the squeeze is just icing on the cake. Institutional shorts really screwed the pooch on this one.
So cute wtf
Spoiler alert, GME employees getting paid with options.
CRSR is iffy
BABA, either direction. Not sure where its going

Sure, valuations are ridiculous. No one is arguing that. But if the institutions stop buying stocks, where do they invest? There's no top unless we can answer that. In 2007, money left stocks to chase 4.75% bonds. Fed had to cut rates to almost zero to bring them back in stocks. Where do they go this time when we entered the crisis already at ridiculously low rates?

He also told one of his buddies “Brooks, I like you now. Get out of here. Go home.".
What’s BABA at?
Not impossible after the Mastercard news + 2000$ stimulus checks
your generalized critique about left/right is meaningless, bring some detailed points to the table or just don't add to the noise, in my opinion

for example, peter thiel is gay, but he's extremely detailed in his critiques about modern society. be more like peter, and not just a "hur dur the left" person. I would say the same thing to an idiot claiming the right is blanket dumb and racist, for example.

How
Best reason I can think of is if someone has a fundamental preference between using calls to hold prices down or using puts to hold prices up. Like they think one of them is more important than the other for the economy or market health or some ethical shit or whatever. A bull who refuses to buy puts because they want to help stabilize growth, or a bear who refuses to buy calls because they want growth to be more volatile. Or some of them might be retards who think calls and puts are just the same thing as buying and selling, so they think calls drive prices up and puts drive prices down, so you could have bears who refuse to buy calls because they think it will stop the market from crashing or bulls who refuse to buy puts because they think it will make the market crash lol

Stock split announcement
i'm new to this forum but why are you all pumping a famously poorly run brick and mortar game store in 2020 when nearly everything is digital? this company should have called it quits years ago and i'm wondering if anyone here honestly believes they have any kind of future.  just what is going on in this sub?
Eh that’s pretty debatable. I remember when trump announced stimulus last time at like 4:30 on a Friday it was the first Green Day in like a month. Macro wise who knows but I think we’ll see a jump tomorrow.
You forgot PLTR 🌝🚀
bears watching futures absolutely drenched in sweat right now.
If Tim 🍏 would have taken that meeting with Elon, it would be a total melt up
Futures are up
I feel happy this stimulus issue has been temporarily resolved, and now they can discuss next round so more pump, anyone else feel this way?
Storytime!
They got cool shit bro check out a store
PLTR to Uranus tomorrow?
Just fyi I have 40k in leaps. I would never put it all on monthlies but I’m looking to put 3k down on those. You said you wanted a play though. I’m expecting a Microsoft backup power contract as well as some on road announcement (maybe with Amazon) by the end of January. Let me know if you put some money down on it. Best of luck.
If it didn’t by April I would start losing value the closer I got to April. This bet is low risk high rewards

Sure, it's what they *say* but at this point the only thing I'd put money on is GME.
I only had this backfire on me when the markets dipped big just before the election, but I closed out the spreads at a loss and started new ones at lower strike prices. So I'd say about 60-70%?
The new strain will just help us achieve herd immunity faster once everyone is infected. Very bullish

I mean the Jets have improved of late.  Darnold is an average QB with two excellent wideouts in Crowder and Perriman.  Gore and Johnson have been over 4 ypc for a few weeks.  Defense has been generating turnovers.  With no professional wideouts available, the Browns were in for a tough game and were by no means a lock.
We want tendies.
Squeeze = Tendies. 
Shares = Squeeze.
Therefore
Shares = Tendies.

Your first point is easily beaten because gamers love more than games. Merchandise is the name of the game for them, when a couple wants matching sweaters of their favorite characters. 

Second point:
Streaming is not gaming. GameStop is pivoting to a new segment called streaming where a girl who loves to show off her cats but needs equipment, could stroll in and leave with a StreamDeck by Elgato, the Razer ringlight webcam, and other peripherals needed for said streaming. It’s not just limited to gamers.

Point three: you think every parent who has a kid begging for a new console is looking at PS5/Series X? Those used consoles from what I saw long before Christmas moved like hot cakes. Take your privilege down a notch and realize many will choose that just to make their young ones happy with something better than what they have now. Preowned consoles that work don’t exist outside of the internet, unless you go to GameStop. Good luck online looking for a bargain, when you can simply pick it up and see it for yourself.

Point Four: good luck if your digital download gets an hero’d like every PS5 customer who wants to play Cyberpunk and goes to the PS store. At least with a disk, you actually own it so nice strawman argument.

Point Five: yes, I’m into that shitty stuff. Your opinion is irrelevant to me because I got more value for my money than a download code to a shitty game. I work in car sales during the week and when I have to fetch new leases... have you heard the OST to Cyberpunk on a X6M stereo? Or a Lexus GS? I got my value in many more ways because for some of us it matters.

That’s why you can’t do DD, your emotions get in the way.
Without looking it up I’d say Probably 300-400k range

No you only pay that initial premium. You can't lose more than that initial amount if you buy a call. The swings don't matter as long as it gets back to the strike before the option expires.
I think it's related to the internet dominating our lives

No lmao. If I absolutely had to be holding puts, the only shot would be on something like BLNK, APPS, FEYE, maybe PTON, or SFIX. Basically anything that just got mooning out of control and is due for a 1-2 day correction

How do we know this isn't just some simulated testing results you ran on ninjatrader. I'd ask you to post the brokerage statements but everything can be faked so don't really give a shit either way.  If you really pulled it off congrats but whatever anomaly you stumbled upon won't last, if I can give you a piece of advice is to quit trading the system or adjust the algo if your equity curve starts to take a prolonged dive because no edge lasts forever I know this for a fact. The best traders know when the edge is gone and quit that trading system (while they're ahead) and move on to another one.

covid stimulus is a rider on the giant omnibus bill, which is a huge funding bill that is must pass and covers a ton of stuff. the reason for a huge must pass bill is because the two parties don't get along well enough to deal together until things reach a critical juncture. Unfortunately, the large must pass funding bill at the last minute is how things have been done for a while (like 10+ years)

They packaged the omnibus spending bill with the stimulus bill so there would just be one thing for trump to sign.

We do t have to but we do give aid to many other countries and things like this and pet projects for other Congress people are often lumped into bills they think will pass. 

Basically they put in a bunch of stuff and if someone goes against the bill for all the unnecessary items they will be shamed for denying the people covid relief or whatever other bill. If you look up the actual wording of any bill passed by Congress the amount of unrelated funds may blow your mind.

The way this sub uses them, options really are just gambling, not investing. You can get lucky once, just like at a casino, but you should expect that you will lose all of your money over time if you continue to play options. There's one safe way to do it, which is writing covered calls, but it gets you "boomer" style gains and will limit your upside if the stock skyrockets - it's the antithesis of what this sub is about. If you want to gain money over time and put yourself in a good place, keep saving money and buy stocks and mutual funds or ETFs with it. Playing with options will make you broke. Read the other posts in this thread. Good luck!

Consensus is 3rd trading day after Q4 earnings call, which hasn't been announced, but will likely happen mid-Feb. Many expect employees to cash out some, but not all, of their stock. Price will likely dip for a few days/weeks. I would expect institutions to snatch up cheap shares, then initiate analyst coverage/buy recommendations after they've loaded up.

Now, and be honest, when you say you "learned" C#, because this was 5 months ago, do you mean that you simply took other people's code off of GitHub etc. and reworked it to your needs?

C# is not an easy language to learn and you starting this 5 months ago and writing a bot within those 5 months to do this in a language I know doesn't just "roll off the tongue" is kind of odd. 

I mean I can be open-minded here but this sounds too good.

It’s true. I’ve been waiting for Monday since Thursday night. I need to get out more.
I have 10c 04/16 for context. It’s a shot company so don’t buy shares, or buy for a short term. Earnings are 01/27, i will exit on 01/26 most likely. They are a shit company because the way I’m which they develop hydrogen is via natural gas, they cut R&D by $1m last Q YOY, there are reports they have lost most of their long term contracts which present a huge portion of their future revenue. They had an offering and are spending that money to pay down debt, this is bad because they need to be spending on R&D vs paying down debt. Just buy Bloom Energy much stronger financials and a clearer path to profitability. But like I said short term play is a major go!
So had RH maintenance call for $166. However I loaded $5000 and it now says I need to call customer service to get instant deposit back. This sucks balls 🏀

Holy shit, I didn't see them either at first. Nicely shown.
HK were not open during last week news. Their markets are just reacting now
>You must not see that GameStop is bigger than games.

You're right. I don't. It might be though because it isn't. And not a single person has shown otherwise.

>The pivot to PC items carefully curated (think; targeting budding streamers) means parents who like I saw today, simply appeasing their kids with purchases that would “let them stream”.

That would be "gaming". That's "games". They sell games and peripherals to gaming aspirations. That's what they do. They don't sell fridges yet.

>Used consoles were all gone, used games thinning out.

The balance sheet shows that inventories rose, not shrunk, YoY. One location is not my focus. Where all the items are gone in one store another somewhere has a backroom overflowing with weird and obscure crap that no one wants.

>Disk games hold value over a download code where Cyberpunk being pulled from PS store, prices.

This is an interesting statement because it is ... complicated. First, a downloaded license can actually be proven to be yours, that is, if someone were to "hack" your account and you reclaimed it you'd get all your games back but if someone steals your disc then it's gone. The reason I say that is because a lot of games on the market are (tada) stolen discs so the value there is strange; you're correct that it is tradeable and completely fungible in nature but you're not correct in that it offers greater viability to the owner. The rights to the items transfer much easier, do so better, and while you can't trade it between points generally speaking they are more reliable because they don't suffer wear and tear and they are more immediate in nature.

>Btw, Cyberpunk 2077 PS4 disks all sold out because you can’t download it. Got a really cool Johnny Silverhand devil logo necklace free with my PC Preorder that had the OST on two disks and a ton of cool box art, postcards, stickers, etc. I paid the same as your pathetic online download. Who got ripped off?

You. You bought a game that doesn't work with some shitty necklace and whatever. I mean if you're into that kind of stuff, great, I actually dislike the frills that come with the deluxe editions but I also don't want to miss content because of it, i.e. the DLC.

For what it is worth though I didn't actually buy Cyberpunk 2077 for the PS4 because almost all major studio games release so buggy and then get fixed that I wisened up and just buy them on sale a month later. I don't have FOMO or the FIFO mentality.

Question, if I received the first stimulus package should I be worried that I won’t receive the second stimulus package? Or did they not change anything for people to receive it? ( I’m a 22 year old who has claimed independent since 2016, lives with parents and is a full time college student. And makes well under 75k a year)
They got bought out/merged by Gamestop which is why I brought it up.

im curious as to their definition of artificial intelligence. the vast majority of data analytics we use now is just uber powered heuristics boosted by the recent advances in data processing power, but they're at most tangentially related to the question of AGI, or general artifical intelligence. so is this initiative focused on machine/deep learning? in which case I still wouldnt say PLTR directly benefits since according to their own words they dont train any AI models, they primarily build data infrastructure/pipelines, especially since they're concerned enough about privacy they dont seek to aggregate data.
i think this may be more related to the questions of regulation and building safety measures when it comes to actual, general artifical intelligence, those that i know elon musk spoke extensively about and pleaded with congress to look ahead with regards to the potential genie in a bottle that AGI could be

I agree but lets look at this past year with tesla, as much as it would make sense to make a safer trade, its gone up 574%. The probability of it going down in the last week of the year I just dont see. My only concern is how much it will go up. Even if it maxes out at 700 (which in my opinion if tesla goes to that point and goes down it eventually will go back up to that point) I'll still double my money and then some with a 690c

See, you’re not thinking deep enough.

Go to Target, Meijer, Walmart, Online (good luck waiting) or the “random mom and pop shut down from losing everything to COVID lockdowns” (bet you never heard of Wizards of the Coast or own tournament Pokémon cards from them) and try to find a used console for a bargain, a bunch of used games that can’t be downloaded or found at your retailers that you selected...

Point being. GameStop is the stop for Gaming. Like it or hate it, many of us would rather go there and scoop a bargain we take home now than trust a delivery by mail where it comes broken, box smashed, shit not working, and “hurr durr here’s a refund” but you waited to even get your hands on it.

Meanwhile I go to GameStop religiously to buy up vintage games you can’t download, and why emulate when the new consoles from Microsoft are basically backward compatible beasts?
I think mr. market is pricing in another Biden stimmy.  If the senate blocks it (they'll suddenly give a shit about the defecit), then we'll probably get a small correction
I'm hesitant about GME short term. The level of euphoria on this sub right now about it reminds me of the hype period of PLTR just before it opened at 31 only to crash down to 26 on the same day.

I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a pullback before we take off, but I'll be adding a little but every day this week no matter what happens.

They seemed cheap to me.
My logic is that everything is undervalued and demand is greater than supply; meaning there is only one direction this can go, and it is up up and away. The lagging sectors lagged the top sectors before the pandemic, this is nothing new; in no way does it predicate that the top sectors will stop going up in order to balance the lagging ones- au contraire, the dominating sectors will continue to dominate while the weak ones will become strong again; they are like allies in this battle of the bull, the weak lending a hand to the strong, meanwhile new ATH’s continue to be etched into the foreheads of all doubting bears.
Tutes are just mad that a populist socialist and populist conservative decided to fuck them by releasing cheap shares to the unwashed, drooling masses.

I can't figure out if Biden officially taking office is gonna be the biggest sell the news event on green energy or if it's gonna be a moonshot. Don't want to psych myself out of easy money, but it seems too damn easy

We r about to gape up to ATH
Absolutely no question, already in deep
I heard memory is memory and the 16GB is basically 16GB (which I have now but intel from late 2018)
That’s just 1 month. BABA just needs to trade flat for 1-2 weeks and you’re doneso.
you can, tastes pretty much the same, lime slows down browning

Bull never sad
Damn. 5 more cents and you can throw a quarter into the fortune teller. Maybe she’ll be able to tell you what to do.
Major bull on BABA, just not yet. Been saying it since the Nov dip. I'll hop back on when it's on the rise (and some people will make 5x the money I make, which is totally great. Big risk, big reward). It is going to be a 1k+ ticker one day. I won't feel bad about getting in at 300 vs 220 at that point.
You belong here wow
some of the best acting of all time

You're not making a strong case for knowing what you're talking about or keeping your cool.
Internet and streaming wasn’t really a thing that hurt Blockbuster. Your timing is a little off. Netflix blew up blockbuster with their Mail program. 

As for a place to buy a game instead of Best Buy? Target, meijer, Walmart, online, random mom and pop type store. The list goes on. 

GameStop has a very tainted view from the hardcore gamers due to their previous business practices. ( Not me)

"Fugayzi, fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust. It doesn't exist. It's never landed. It is no matter. It's not on the elemental chart. It's not fucking real"


That encapsulates how I feel about it. I think yeah next few years there could be a few run ups and some money to be made. Long term tho, like 15-20 years, nobody will care anymore
Yes really. Especially aapl as a long term investment. It will be 200 by June-july
Nope, futures were red a few hours ago, before trump signed, now they have turned solid green. No one knew/expected him to sign today. So tomorrow is going to be a blood red day 😂😂
Maybe 8
Idk
You stupid twat. I’m full in calls. That’s why there is sad emoji you dumb fuck
No. Once it goes into merger you have to cash out at $20 or agree to stay on. You can in no way reap the benefit by selling on LOI. But if enough people don’t hold through merger, my 2/9 turns into 3/9 or 4/9. Use your head.
They're 3 years behind all their competition in terms or tech, design and hardware.

What options do you trade with $500? Couldn't imagine doing this with less than $5k
Why bears exist? This is my theory. 

Stonks can go up to any percentage +100%, +1600%. any higher percentage is possible, infinite potential. So maximum potential unpredictable.

But stonks can only go down -100%. There is a limit so its minimum is predictable. Since the bear case has a predictable limit, narcissitic bears think that they have big brains predicting a crash stay bears forever.
It’s a flop

It was cold in the morning, with dusty air blanketing everything as far as Sana'a could see from her position on the rooftop in Karachi. She stood up and stretched, and it felt good after a night of sleeping on the mattress on the hard ground. She looked down, and Fatima was still fast asleep. She rubbed her eyes, and decided to get cracking on the morning chai. She started brushing her teeth, and sleepily opened the newspaper. Her eyes widened, and the brush fell out of her mouth, as she leapt to her feet. With trembling hands, she reread the headline to make sure she wasn't dreaming, and then let loose a whoop that echoed off the empty walls. At long last, Allah had answered her prayers. Her decision to major in gender had been finally vindicated. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

If you wanted a game right now not available to download, would you go to Best Buy which only carries new releases?

Where could you get a game used outside of eBay and know you’re not scammed?

Let’s say you broke your controller, because the USB port finally is so weak your controller disconnects when the breeze blows. Would you order from Amazon knowing GameStop down the block and around the corner has it same price but you can go and get it now?

Blockbuster mattered when internet meant streaming and downloads was outside of just renting a VHS or DVD. Go download a PS5 or a controller, a game not available online that they happen to have used and verified working versus an eBay promise that takes too long to ship for your impatient paper hands selling this stock.

GameStop has enough value for Cohen to be here too. Bet he’s got a sick game collection that you can’t download.

GameStop IS the biggest gaming store outside of purely digital storefronts like Steam. But you paid $60 for Cyberpunk 2077 download... I paid $60 for Cyberpunk 2077, a free necklace that looks dope AF, the OST on original disks, a map of the city that folds out, postcards from Night City, and a box to frame and hang like the executives who rushed the game out.

Try again.

Edit: I bought that lone 3DS for $120 because I could verify it works perfectly and I got Pokemon Crystal used, on cartridge, for when my daughter is old enough to try to catch Suicune.

The EO is a better solution. He gets to sign certain parts into law that he approves of, and sends the part about giving other countries more money than Americans back for a vote so politicians can go on record to say "here's your measly $600 while Sudan gets $700 million, Cambodia gets $100 million, etc". The bill is veto proof. The EO just gets the funding to the right places without being delayed over the corrupted areas of the bill.

What in boomer fuck is going on here
If I see the ticker ICLN, I like the comment. That simple. Good or bad, it doesn’t matter. I can’t read anyway
Because a 13% drop on $700 billion company is unjustified. Companies like that don’t go to zero or keep drilling like that. Its lost like 30% of its total value from all time high and some point its time to get in. We’re not talking airlines or CCL here lol. 

Shares at these levels are a criminal steal, leaps maybe who knows, selling puts hell yes. FD’s tho, yeah retarded. I know that’s probably what you’re referring to. Since that’s what wsb is doing lol

I can buy a video game almost anywhere. If I wanted a specific old game I could buy it on eBay or Amazon or some specialty shop locally. 

While I agree it’s a nice place to shop, it’s by no means a great place to invest anymore. That ship has already sailed.

All of this is just my opinion. I’ve been wrong many many times.
They are gonna push for a separate bill down the road possibly for the $2k, we’ll see cuz $600 is already issued

Baba down in HK markets. They're buying back shares but it's not working. On the other hand, on site investigations into alibaba went smoothly and have finished.

If you can play this right, there'll be huge gains. Unfortunately this is WSB and I am a part of it.
Without a doubt.

Once before the opening bell and one right before lunch.
Thanks for posting this. Just one comment, wouldn't the additional 2 shares every 9 be priced in? In that case, you can still sell on announcement and reap the benefit of the tontine structure.

not really..  BABA  HK dropped only 8%  the day before and US 13%.  It has caught up now.    Math?

You must not see that GameStop is bigger than games. The pivot to PC items carefully curated (think; targeting budding streamers) means parents who like I saw today, simply appeasing their kids with purchases that would “let them stream”. 

Used consoles were all gone, used games thinning out. Disk games hold value over a download code where Cyberpunk being pulled from PS store, prices. 

Btw, Cyberpunk 2077 PS4 disks all sold out because you can’t download it. Got a really cool Johnny Silverhand devil logo necklace free with my PC Preorder that had the OST on two disks and a ton of cool box art, postcards, stickers, etc.

I paid the same as your pathetic online download. Who got ripped off?

So basically the "good news" is he's enacting the impoundment control act. Essentially delaying the checks for 45 days while he 'negotiates' with congress to fix the bill.

Bill will go through, but with a 45 day delay, Congress will do nothing because doing nothing is what they excel at
Premiums ridiculous on fubo puts? My RH is being a dick.

Of course they’re against the California regulations. They have the most popular cars on the market rn. The Camry outsells everything. They have zero reason to rush into anything. I’m just saying they have been using hybrid batteries for like 20 years. They’ve got plenty of experience there. I have more faith in Toyota than I do GM that’s for sure. GM did make a decent EV but couldn’t sell it for shit so it failed lmao.

>"Where do you think Gamestop will be in 5 years?"

You see that question? All of you keep fucking up talking about where GME will be in 6 months. We *already know where it will be in 6 months* so no one cares. It's not "due diligence" to continuously echo your own sentiments written three hundred different ways.

Tell me, or anyone for that matter, where this company will be in a decade. That's what is important. Because the thesis is this: in a decade this thing will be dead and gone. No one cares that it was busy December 27th, 2020 when in 2025 it won't exist anymore. Stop beating the same drumbeat  thinking you're writing new songs.

Tbf since she’s saving and investing she’s probably doing better than most American already.
I swear this idiot posts here.  Love it.
I see, so as long as price is going up, it must mean the market is oversold otherwise, it wouldn't be going up is your logic. 

As for sectors, sure, some are lagging but others are way up but if the ones that are way up just keep going up, then the lagging ones will always lag. Don't you think there will be some sort of balance where the high flying sectors drop as the lagging ones catch up?

I bought in at $8 simply because it was the only social media network I've used that actually has done what social media was supposed to do - enhance personal relationships from afar. 

Idk if it will hit $100 but I still use it regularly and feel like it's sort of the Apple of the social media world. Doing its own thing and when others try to replicate, it just doesn't work well for some reason.

🚀🚀🚀
Well, yes, because as a GME long I benefit from more marginal retail shorts getting squeezed out whenever there's material news or Cohen waves his dick around. It's not enough that I should succeed, others must fail.

Imagine you're the guy who made the fateful decision to short this stock.  Then when it was time to close the position, instead you somehow convince your boss that double down.  Now months later, you're deep underwater and desperately don't want to get fired (from your cozy 7 figure salary job).  So you decide to pull another stunt by purchasing puts with the company money.  

This whole thing looks like decent bet (GME going bankrupt) that went sour (enter Cohen and console release) and a few people trying to save face (and trying to save their Christmas bonus) by making the situation worse.  I mean, if you were some hot-shot wallstreet exec, would you ever admit your mistake?  Or use all the available tools to manipulate and suppress the stock in order to cover up your screw up?
Because it's worth it and we're all just trying to pass time until the market opens anyway

Why?  MMs pinning this.
I like to think more about the friends I made along the way
I’m with you on SQ these 250c are gonna print
No prob. 

I am unfamiliar with that app so can’t speak to its functions. Commons just means the normal stock or shares you can buy or sell. You should easily be able to buy those anywhere. Both RobinHood and Wealth Simple, the iPhone apps in the USA and Canada, respectively, support purchase of the common PSTH stock. Calls refers to call options in this case. Basically they allow you to bet on the odds the stock increases in the future. Options form the basis of this entire subreddit. They significantly amplify gains but also losses. Options can expire worthless, and you lose the premium, that’s the risk. Common shares don’t come with that risk. If I was you I would buy some commons if you like PSTH and at least do some reading on options before you get into it. Lots of YouTube videos for a beginner. Also just passively read wsb and you’ll learn a lot from these people about what not to do. Have fun and good luck.
Just send me your money and I can DM you "-99.9%"
BABA CALLS = FREE MONEY

We also might get 2k for the ppl! Put the printer on over drive!! I hope so i bought some short dated calls.
I'm only iffy on them because the CEO says nobody wants electric cars, and they sided against the California vehicle emissions regulations (while other companies like Honda supported it). They make fantastic hybrids but they're being really skittish about BEVs.

Yes give me tendies and i’ll make sure your palantir calls don’t expire.
Why the fuck am I watching the HK market? China showed me who was the real ladyboy is.. fucks me then I ask for more. At least I have some time but god damn do I hate getting pegged by BABA's big red dildo's on Christmas Eve. My biggest position too. I have Feb 300c and March 275c guess I'll be bagholding til' they expire worthless.
I have a good feeling if we can hold this up till tomorrow. If numbers are good and market stays green I don’t see why we shouldn’t moon.
It’s flat with US market. Probably waiting to see what happens at 4am.

Baba is up when converting to USD my dude.  215 HK is US close on Thursday
Thanks a lot for the explanation but I am a still a bit confused.  In the example above the there is $833 to be made by exercising the option and then selling it. Will selling the option itself get similar amount of gains?
I can see 4 corsair logos right now and I wasn't even trying to buy their shit.

First time on WSB and I’ve been lurking your posts all weekend. I like your research and reasoning so I’m ready to swing on this but I’m intimidated by all the terms I don’t understand. Apologize in advance for being a complete noob but can I buy “commons and calls” through Merrill edge app? Pretty sure I know what commons are but idk how to buy a call. Don’t expect a full tutorial but any resources to get me up to speed would be super appreciated. Thanks man.

Also HKD to USD

I’ve read through every comment and still can’t tell if it’s a joke or not...
HK 215 is equal to US close.  Anything above means we're green tomorrow
Just won a poker tourney for 500. Give me a 500 > 5k play

I'm holding some LOW calls myself.  Cramer keeps pumping them as a stimulus winner - all the sheep should drive it up (yeah, guess we're sheep too).
140% agree. Ubisoft sucks balls. How the fuck they delay 2-3 titles for two years in a row?
Haha that’s the hk market the Americans know how to pump on the news buckle up put pussy
Well said, didn’t even post her charts how we know she made money off it after investing weeks or months ago lol, tik tokers are cancer lol
2k to 7k this year  mostly options high of 10k
Fuck NKLA
I watched the 2017 bitchcoin bubble run up to 20k then pop and shit the bed down to 3k. Now it’s doing amazing, but that initial massive fomo run up in TSLA could have the same outcome where it bleeds 50 percent or more simply due to a FUD cycle. Basically you get a cyberpunk lelel of hype around anything, and then when it doesn’t deliver perfectly people flip their shit, TSLA is that hyped that the emotional pendulum will swing harder than people realize when FUD starts coming out.
I bought at it's bottom, so okie doke rn
That was already  priced in, I'm expecting ppl piling in on longs at this point.

You are a massive spamming sack of shit. Take your retardation to the Nikola sub.
all news is good news. haha I love that we pumped because everyone thought the stimmy checks would be $2000 and now it's only $600. There is no bad news anymore. BTFD and stonks only go up now.
i dont get it. who is this guy?
🤣🤣🤣🤣 and WSB delivers.
How’d the vid go? She troll everyone again?
is RIOT gonna moon tmrw or am i getting my hopes up for -3.4%

Why did this weekend feel like it was 9 days long?

I hope they do. I don’t think they can hold the senate if they don’t pass the $2k checks. I’m republican and how they’ve handled this whole fiasco has pissed me off and I know it has pissed off other republicans. I don’t agree with the shutdown but if the government is going to keep business shutdown than they need to provide for those who can’t work.

at 90 maybe if long. I see much better plays personally. If you were to do so and it was me Id buy at the 20ma or leaps. Honestly leaps 5-10% out the money would make more sense at the right price but thats just me. You could throw 25% of w/e you were going to throw and make way more while having more money for more plays. Plenty opportunity in 2021
rentals look cheap as shit, especially for one bedrooms.. now granted im trying to live in the more desirable areas around here but its up like 30% over the past 2 years

Get your GME on
Rogaine 2X per day and finasteride. I’ve been on that regimen 10 years now and my hair still looks great.
when it was 7k last jan, a group of analysts predicted it will be 20k at the end of the year. people laughed and corona happened. yet it crushed 20k.Same people are predicting it will be 350k by the end of 2021... not my words... go figure lol.
Never question pltr

I guess it normally pumps 10% and then fucks you the rest of the week?
We already had an analyst up the price target to $50. Not that anyone gives a shit what analysts think, but remember when every analyst was upgrading TSLA pre market and the stock would hit the PT within minutes?

In for 3700 shares and more coming Monday.
Buying all those calls during the dip on Thursday might just change my life forever fellas 💸
PLTR tomorrow: 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Probably the big font lmao
I’m down quite a bit I bought at $29 I hope it goes up

Quit my day job I no longer liked to remodel rental properties.  Started paper trading while doing this.  Remodels haven't been a full time job so decided to raid the rental LLC operating account and put 110k in RobinHood.  YOLO'd into BTC and have been dabbling in meme stocks.  Up 65% total after 2 months.    Covers my thrifty ass living expenses for the next 1-2 years, but I want a yacht and maybe also to ruin my life so learning options now
Oh yeah those 20 PLTR shares really affected the price

Same but only a few % too much validity on Thursday made calls expensive
For a struggling couple with two kids they get $2400 and that likely gets a couple of months of groceries, utility bills covered, and maybe a chunk of rent but not much more and that assumes they aren't already way behind on bills or overdrawn on their account. Bank that receives the distribution will get paid first and bring the account out of the red. 

In short, for those that need it the most, its not nearly enough. For those that need it least, its nothing to get excited about. Fucking joke all around.

thoughts on MGNI
Lick it up? More like limit up amirite ahahaha jk plz don’t give me a swirly chad hedge fund manager
Do you already have a roth ira with either fidelity or another provider, call them up and have them transfer. Check with your 401k provider and see if there is a limit on transfers a year, ideally you would want to transfer often a year since the longer your after-tax contributions sit in the 401k the gains made off them are taxable, whereas once it's transfered to a roth the gains are not taxable. We transfer once a month, so 12 times a year
Yes! Same. Need more dates for the options
Sounds like superb autism to me🚀🚀🚀🚀

$BABA okay kiddies, let’s get this straight. The Hong Kong market did not get to react to Thursday’s news like ours did because it was CLOSED when the news came out. Today’s (Monday in China!) dip is just a reflection of how ours dipped last week. Stop your fear mongering 🙄
Do u use? I’ve heard mixed things
So basically you’re better than them. And never had a drawdown 🤣and you literally said you would explain in detail how you did it
You mean from traditional to Roth? You can do back door Roth contribution for the post tax money. You just have to open Roth and traditional Ira in fidelity

When you have a 10 year bull market, a government that absolutely cannot let the corporate stock market fall, free bailouts for the rich, leverage (margin/options etc), extreme wealth inequality, and the obsessive need for the rich to grow their assets, a bubble of this proportion is bound to happen when you start tinkering with RH long enough
Your social credit just got fucked, buddy
I lost a lot more than 20k thinking FDA would allow Ph2/3 when they were supposed to. Was one of the dumb moves on my ride down

I am not in INO, and I do think something shady is going on with the shorts, including potentially them knowing inside information about FDA leeriness about INO tech, or actual FDA corruption with conflicted FDA insiders etc.

Aschoff, the INO bear at Roth, played a role in a similar story of corruption regarding a biotech company called Dendreon back in the day:

https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-4614.pdf

The fact that peer reviewers held up INO's paper for that long is also super sus on the part of the peer reviewers.

So yeah I am staying away from INO, until it can shake off the shorts with results.

Puts on my hairline
You're getting negative return by holding that debt though. If you have a 20k loan compounding at 8% (a number i pulled from my anus btw) then your net worth decreases by 8% of 20k every year you carry that debt. By paying off the 20k, you save yourself from paying additional interest. I'll put it another way, say you start the year with a 20k loan out at 10% (to make the math easy), and you also conveniently have 20k cash in the bank. Your net worth is zero. If you pay off your loan and wait a year (assuming you spend everything you earn and take no more debt) obviously you have a net worth of zero. Now lets say instead you decide to put that money in an ETF that goes up by exactly 10% and keep the loan. At the end of the year, your ETF portfolio is worth 20k+10% interest = 22k, but your debt is also 20k+10% interest = 22k. Your net worth is still 0. Paying off a loan has the same effect on your net worth as making an investment with the same interest rate.

Hold on, so you’re saying you made half a mil and it’s your “holy grail” is better than Steve Cohen and Jim Simmons and you’ll share your strategy with anyone DMing you? 🤣🤣
even worse, most americans get paid friday and are broke on monday.
So reading between the lines, what you are saying is that you are offering to eat your own shit if it does?
Fucked
wtffffff
This is the most bearish post on Baba I’ve seen in 3 months
it's worth a speculative position maybe! But it's squeezed already.

Most short squeezes are NOT +400% in a day. They're more like OSTK/TSLA. But they also require better than expected fundamentals
Hahaha he literally followed up the dividend thing with “having constant cash flow is a good thing” and I was like yeah man that’s what a fucking job is for
When do you expect the dip? Roughly.  Please and thank you
Market doesn’t follow logic remember
We need round the clock stimulus. Exponential, compounded stimulus all day everyday.
You call 32.80 a squeeze? Call me when it's 420.69
is nio on the china exchange like baba?

Stock moved from pre covid highs or 20s to now in 50s and you suggesting rotation to value will propel it higher. Right. Puts it is just like last time.
No.  Because HK went first, and went down 8%.  Then US opened after HK closed and went down 13%.  So HK needdd to drop a decent amount to catch up to US. tl;dr 215 on the HK index is equivalent to US close on Thursday.  Anything abive 215 is green for us tomorrow
A C T C is one I'm watching

The incentive structure is covered in all of the deep dives. But yes, that’s the entire point of the tontine. It’s also not just that you lose the extra warrants by selling. Someone else gets them. So the minimum we get as holders is 2/9. That can increase to 3/9 or 4/9 if more people sell. That’s why holding the stock is gigantic value. Someday you’ll all wake up to what is in front of you.
Damn, just remember money can be made and losses made up, it's just money. You as a person cannot be replaced. Take a breath, you'll be ok. The road ahead is tough, but you'll be ok. Its time for professional advice, beyond what you'll likely find on a thread here.

If it moons at open how do I buy $20 shares tomorrow?

It was cold in the morning, with dusty air blanketing everything as far as Majid could see from his position on the rooftop in Karachi. He stood up and stretched, and it felt good after a night of sleeping on the mattress on the hard ground. He looked down, and Tarif was still fast asleep. He rubbed his eyes, and decided to get cracking on the morning chai. He started brushing his teeth, and sleepily opened the newspaper. His eyes widened, and the brush fell out of his mouth, as he leapt to his feet. With trembling hands, he reread the headline to make sure he wasn't dreaming, and then let loose a whoop that echoed off the empty walls of the haveli. At long last, Allah had answered his prayers. His decision to major in gender had been finally vindicated. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Some insights from my buddy who just graduated with a finance degree:

“Dividend stocks are the future”

“Market‘s gonna be up or down tomorrow”

Important to note he’s not being sarcastic here
Q1 retail surge?
Just bear in mind 20% up in one day can easily mean 20% down in one day is possible.

High returns almost always pair with high risk and the most obvious manifestation of high risk is an enormous beta. The whole diamond hand thing is just a shorthand for not spending years studying risk and capital markets. The short version is you *cannot* do this if you get scared and sell on big red days.
Not good. You are exposed.

CIM or NUE calls. CIM has div Monday and NUE has div Tuesday so it depends on the play. I am bullish CIM/long and think it should outperform if there is an amendment to the current bill to make it $2000 instead of $600.

The narrative is what creates bubbles. This time it's Elon + EV's, but understand that the reasons TSLA seems like such an obvious bet to you is the exact same mental trap everyone falls into with every bubble.

The super easy to understand and obvious growth narrative isn't what makes TSLA not a bubble, it's literally the defining characteristic. If the story didn't write itself, it would have no chance of becoming a bubble. You're confusing the reasons you don't think it's a bubble, with exactly with WHY it's a bubble.

I’d be interested in knowing how this affects stock purchase/sales. In theory, I would think it would make the stock price shoot up right before merger from people buying in an attempt at getting 2 additional shares at a cheap price. Has there been another SPAC that has had this same setup? Where you get incentivized with additional shares for holding through merger? I’d love to see how it panned out for them. It could be something nice to add to your DD. Thanks

Right, an investment in equities in a 401k isn't gambling and long term isn't affected by any Wall Street dumbassery. As long as businesses can find a productive way to use capital, equities will have a real, positive expected return. This has been true as long as equity has existed, but it's also true that bubbles have existed for as long. I guess the problem is most investors can't tell when things are getting over priced.

Also, I think Cramer is more like financial entertainment than anything (and CNBC overall is primarily for entertainment). I feel like Stewart should be pissed that so many people are so dumb as to think Cramer provides real advice. The failure is the education system more than the hacks at the TV network trying to create an entertaining show.

I used to have semi-all nighters down to a science in college. Take a 20mg addy right before I go to sleep at midnight, it kicks in and wakes you up at 3am so you have just enough sleep to not be jittery. 2 rips from a bowl to get creative, a Red Bull and a lip of dip for the energy and confidence to bullshit a paper or cram a semester of a subject into a night. Take a shot of rumplemintz on the way out the door to keep the buzz rolling and have that minty-fresh breath.

I love the hubris of TSLA investors. Like people didn't react exactly the same to articles about their beloved AOL, or [pets.com](https://pets.com), or w/e meme bubble is going on at the time.   


This time is different, Elon is my lord and savior, it's not a bubble people just don't understand, on and on and on.   


I hope TSLA succeeds in the long run, but you guys are most likely setting yourselves up for a bitchoin 2017 bubble pop that is going to shake out all the weak hands before mooning years later.   


Just stop acting like people who are drawing these parallels are stupid because literally every bubble is super convincing and obvious to the believers at the time, thats the fucking point. It has to be super obvious for it to become a bubble. The amazing narrative of TSLA doesn't preclude it from being a bubble, it's the god damn defining characteristic of it being a bubble.

8 BABA shares in Hong Kong is one USA share and the exchange rate is 0.13 so do the math and BABA 216 HK IS 225 US

You’ve earned it 10x over. 

Regardless of what happens Monday.....HOLD STRONG AND BUY THE FUCKING DIPS.

If all 1.7 million of us retards hold strong we can beat the MM’s. I mean shit there’s only ~100m shares and at least 9 million of them aren’t for sale...so if every WSB member tried to buy just 100 shares that alone would moon the price. 

I don’t know about you but I have a significantly larger position than 100 shares and there is no scenario in which I sell until AFTER the short interest has dropped by at least 80%.

Everyone should just hedge with like 5% into ~6 month out SPXS calls, and roll them out when needed. Insane profits if the market actually takes a shit
Statistically number of trades is inversely proportional to performance. And the commissions for that would be intense. So unless you're an institutional trader it would be neigh on impossible to pull what you say off.

Yeah it’s got to be much deeper than a purely financial/organizational investigation. This is the kind of thing that is settled very easily in Chinese culture behind the scenes. I would bet anything Ma did something to piss off the party, they told him to atone for his sins in some way, and then he refused...so all of a sudden they bring these antitrust charges against baba publicly.

Further drops in battery cost will lead to lower cost batteries. Not to higher margins. You really believe that Tesla has a monopoly on batteries?

Other car companies with better production lines will crush Tesla with more efficient production.

Tesla already had to shut down the model X and S lines this month because of lack of demand. So basically they have big demand for 2 maybe 1 model. Other car companies can just target that one model and sell below cost until Tesla dies.

No. 105 pre gets you 105 commons post with the option for an additional 22 at $23. Read my last DD and the example calculation. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kkukb8/psth\_warning\_shot\_qa\_ive\_done\_well\_in\_this\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kkukb8/psth_warning_shot_qa_ive_done_well_in_this_market/)
PLTR is a multi year play or at least a year long play.

Stop thinking in terms of a few days.
100% yes.



Really I’d be fine with 900k, minus the taxes.

What’s the max tax, 40%? 

So call it 540k after taxes. Four percent (easily done) gives me 20k a year, forever. Even more if I use that to max out Roth.

What’s more, it gives my two children 10k/ea per year, for roughly half or 2/3 of their lives, depending on when I die. 

Think of it this way, would you rather have one really horrible year, or work 40 hours a week pretty much until you’re old and broken?

A year has ~8700 and change hours in it. 

If I retire 30 years from now, and I work 40 hour weeks until then, that’s 62,400 hours. 

It’s not even close - of course I take the year in prison for a half mill after taxes.
Because they actually have profit and cashflow.. So they don't need funding.

But other than that, Germany would never let them go bust, so they do have funding secured.
I think the proper term for this would be the Trailer Park Speedball. As long as you don’t exceed the recommended NyQuil dosage u should be fine.

Exactly.

G2, is there any other kind?
alright since futures are mooning I’ll ask again, what is PLTR gonna open at?
^^
Cheers. 2021 is gonna be the year of the SPAC. Billy will come up with something. You recommend all common or warranrs

Why Thursday? For the new year?
$BB $483c got it
half of the shit amazon sells is from baba lol
Whether you are laddering bonds at 2%, buying S&P ETHs, or shorting TSLA on margin, you are getting paid for risking your capital.  The difference is just in your risk/reward expectation and whether you know what edge you are playing.
What is a good call option for them?

Well with over 6500 trades my positions won’t really be interesting or provide any value.

Funny how people thought BABA was so safe, because there's no way the Communist Party would want to fuck up a Chinese company that big...


Yeah, Chairman Mao once let 50 million of his own people die. The CCP dgaf 🇨🇳
Bought four BABA 1/8/21 220 calls on Thursday don’t worry boys these retards don’t know that BABA is still at Thursday close pretty much 🆙🔜
Yes... It is
Still holding??? You act like this SPAC is stale after 1 day of memeing here 

Damn this long weekend really fucked your head 😏
Some Korean accounts commented on his interview lol. Sound too good to come true but who knows. Coupang beats Amazon in Korea.
Lmao green as fuck tomorrow. He waited for Sunday evening to sign and pump the market one last time
Puts?
Cannot fucking wait. Stimmy pump plus Bitcoin mooning. Sweet Jesus
so as part of signing the relief bill, trump wanted congress to evaluate repealing section 230. Is this bearish for facebook and twitter or is it a nothing burger?
Buy JD stock
Cool don't see many people in here pumping fcel. Here's to another 4 days of pumping 30% each day
Thanks
Send it
I’ll be at your mom’s house tonight meet me there
you write really nice and hard. Full compliment, no shitposting.
I'm interested as well. If you find out a genuine answer please let me know
It's not a good sign if HKEX is red though. It means investors outside of the US aren't confident in buying the dip. If anything, this will just signal to America to sell more tomorrow.
Did you know that BABA isn’t even Alibaba? It’s for a shell company that owns equity in Alibaba. China doesn’t allow foreign investors. That would be what I’m worried about—if China cracks down on that shit as retaliation after the US delisted a bunch of Chinese companies from the NYSE. There’s a reason those call were cheap
You fucking moron. It dumped lol
It’s a little more than 6x what DeepFuckingValue has made off a meme stock. If the squeeze continues, he may end up with more than what we gave to Pakistan.
only americans would complain about a free 600 bucks.
yeah i’m liking mine, there aren’t many PS5 titles out rn but i do find some PS4 games play better as compared to my PS4 Pro. Obviously don’t pay above retail for it though

You should be able to do ITM call calculations.

If you can't you should NOT being buying them, maybe $16ish on the 38s and $24 on the 30s rough guess and IV at the time will make a lot of difference
What did you want them to give you 100 bands, get a job broke fuck

He’s right, calculate the closing price of baba in the two markets on any day other than December 24th. That’s the difference between the two markets. And then multiply or divide that number into HKSE to get NYSE.
I can punish her for you

I wasn’t ready!
huh? you think ppl on unemployment are gonna invest in stocks instead of paying rent or buying food?
Buy JD stock better than BaBa
Well said
I was so worried my dad was going to lose his job paving roads in Sudan. Thank God Trump signed.
I'd wait for a while before touching baba. All China stocks are a but risky till we see how the market keeps reacting, but I'd buy JD, busy, nio, Li,xpev, JKs and dq etc. before baba atm.

Haha.. asking cos want to participate :)
Agreed. The shit about him manipulating stocks was bad and Cramer gave some half assed denial cause he knows it's illegal, but the other stuff was pretty stupid. Some of the stuff Stewart was saying was just plain wrong and anyone who has taken an Econ 101 course should know it's wrong.
When Pelosi found out Trump wanted $2,000 she upped it and put it to a vote and the House GOP blocked it. Blame the GOP bro. The Dems would give everyone $10K and an 8 ball for stimulus

OP, good job. What's your process of selecting stocks? Presumably you get in before or on day 1 of pump.
You would probably be a millionaire
What if BABA doesn’t do shit tomoerow
It’s more than that. We are oversold despite what you think, all sectors have yet to catch up and people are itching to buy more.
Yes buy calls now
Short telsa got it burrrrryyyyy
Are you still in INO? I lost 20k on calls thinking thinking their paper will be published back in September.
Looking that way in the asian markets right now.
Sounds similar to my case

No?
I am long on PLTR but we all know how it has been acting the last few weeks.

Is another 20% day too much to ask for?
Hot take: This stock could perform in the short term but long term it's fucked after pandemic. Nobody knows what will happen but signs are pointing to it being heavily overvalued at the moment and will more than likely drop for a bit, with some upside after a (likely) good earnings.
what calls should one buy?
Positions? Futures are too binary and competitive for luck not to be the decisive factor
where is the news about psth and coupang, i found nothing online

I hope you're right cause I'm balls deep in BABA. I'm mentally prepared for a 211 retest and possibly a collapse to 189.
You see that building? I bought that building ten years ago. My first real estate deal. Sold it two years later, made an $800,000 profit. It was better than sex. At the time I thought that was all the money in the world. Now it's a day's pay.

Yes but I can’t find chargepoint on yahoo financials
Honestly if you just DD this sub with r/stocks and never learn about options, you won’t become like half the retards here that take out loans and yolo PLTR 20p 12/4. No I’m not saying sucking buffets dick doing s&p for 35 years until you’re divorced fat and lonely. 10k of PLTR shares at $18 though last month? Yeah you’ll see some wild swings. But you won’t become homeless overnight begging for help on the internet to other ppl laughing at you.
ok, thank you
Stimulus is not the main driver at this point...it's the institutions that are starting to get into it. Now you have retail and institutions getting it. BTC is gonna have a decent dip for a buy...but over a year...it's a buy...it's broken every record this year...plus you have the halving coming up in '24 i believe

I disagree with the reasoning and Tesla is definitely not AOL. That company was trash.


But his premise that Tesla is overvalued and could drop dramatically may still be right. It won't be due to a lack of innovation or technology, though. It'll be meme and YOLO guys who move on to stuff like PLTR because TSLA loses its potential to moon constantly. That could be their biggest problem.

Hoping PTON continues this uptrend!
I mean, I just opened up your profile and scrolled through your comments. Pretty much everything you say is trash and gets downvoted. If like 1/3 or 1/2 of your comments have negative Karma, it's you are either a terrible troll or you typically don't have much value to say.
BABA is painful to watch. I feel like I’m watching it get fucked with the strap on knife dildo from the movie 7 right now.
Probably owns 0.25 Tesla shares

300 gets added onto the unemployment you already receive?
Lmao seriously, I bought $1k of ARKG a month ago that I’m up 40% on but still have $5k in VOO. Moving basically all of that into ARKG now fuck it, I mostly just wanna have VGT, ARKG, ARKK and ICLN in my Roth now
Hell yea bro that’s the right spirit

If PLTR were to hit 50 by end of January realistically, and just a rough estimate, how much money would I make if I have 5/21 38C and 3/19 30C? I have roughly $1,000 in them total
RIP
Trumpy signed stimmy here we green!
Buying shares is great. Just pay attention. Things get tricky with your warrants once LOI happens. Pay attention to any emails or mail correspondence you get when this goes postal on LOI.

Cruises, and airlines will be up bigly. Not sure about BA
$LUMN is an absurdly convex play. Leaps are trading for 10 or 15 cents a share. the 35 contracts I bought for approx $500 would be worth $37k if share price hits $30 in the next year.

I'd recommend just adding a tiny position just based on this alone. I do agree that Lumen is a boomer company that's doing a rather lazy job of turning itself around but a catalyst, and therefore crispy tendies, could appear from fricking nowhere.

positions: 35x Jan 21/22 20c
China is in a different time zone my good man
Really lol?
Anyone that has watched the seminar with Elon Musk and Jack Ma and *still* bought calls on BABA deserves this loss. Jack Ma is a moron that was given a golden ticket to rub elbows with the elite of the CCP and then used that golden ticket to wipe his ass.
BABA at 170 a good deal tbh.
I mean it ain't life changing. But 600 each fam of 4 is 2400 tax free. I wouldn't just throw it away?

If you can't understand that you can't understand any of this. Also OTM calls are fine too, it depends on the investor's personal situation. Use your head.
BABA isn’t even down ya’ll just don’t know how to calculate. 

To convert BABA on HKSE you multiply x8 and divide by 7.75. Or just multiply HK price x 1.032. 

BABA price is actually $224 right now and up 1%
Big yes

Say goodbye to green candles for the mooning meme stocks in the short term
Switched to Baba shares monday last week and sold my bleeding leaps at a loss.  Looks like I dodged a bullet ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
its actually up in USD
[removed]
some twitter dweeb said he should put a joke disclaimer on that tweet. 🤦‍♂️
Yea probably I think it’ll be just fine
Got 2023 baba calls too early 😢
Oh yea thats been happening for years now.  And we are certainly reaching huge cost reductions there too.  But yes i hold a fund for robotics.  BOTZ
is a ps5 even worth getting as of now
Can't buy GME calls in Germany. Or maybe I'm to retarded.

If some retard here knows how to. Pls help
IV crush Anyone?
For the bulls, I hope so, but realistically... it ain't.
orange man bad?
AMZN, SQ, and PYPL
VALE is my 2nd biggest position behind TECK. I like that VALE is expanding into Copper. I have 1500 shares.
Your comment isn't really true. He is on record being bullish 2021. Literally articles with that headline, lol. Read more. Good luck.

I just hate thinking about the market & my plays . & two of my bigger losses have been on 2 of our red mondays in past month and a half or so z it’s a stupid rule I have now
And PLTR
Should have invested in 8 balls. With the border shut down the prices are through the roof!
Thats what you get for buying commie stocks

Bye bye BABA
I think a fair analogy is like if you found out that cute quiet girl you knew from school had a sextape leaked. You’d definitely just want to look out of curiosity. But in this case it’s her neck beard fanbase that were simping over her prior to any suggestive content seeing this is like a dream come true
These people don’t realize that HKSE is just equaling out to NYSE levels.
Ah. Classic. Telling a retard to not be a retard.
Talk talk talk
Pore guy
This advice was good the first stimulus not this time
No. Stay away from options. Buy AAPL and pick some ARK fund. Buy every month. Don’t put all your money at once.
Following u
Yes, but more worthwhile is that it seems lion electric picked up on a contract that nikola was supposed to get i think for around 2000 or 2500 trucks. 

The amazon is a trial run from what I can see. If they get more orders I see them getting funding for a larger US plant. Hence why they want to go public to secure funding for such an endeavor
IDK. You still have money left with 1 week until YTD ends.
Yeah I'm about even on BABA. I bought shares at 214 back in april, then doubled up on monthly calls when it dipped to $190, now I'm down 70% on LEAPs bought during the "dip" to from 319 to 290.

Baba might get pwned and go to like $40. CCP China is no joke and they have gone through these crazy ass faction wars every 5-10 years lol, and seems Jack Ma is on the other side of "the party" with recent comments... study up on what happens even to rich people who disagree with the government that somehow still live in the PRC -- this is the only reason they are going in on BABA after also getting rid of ANT after all of these years propping up the BABA/Ma directly. Something weird going on there between Xi and him rn.
That might’ve been the nastiest shit I’ve ever drunk. I just bought it about 30 seconds ago and cracked it open.
What is $600 gonna do
I want to enter some long positions but it looks like I am going to have to wait for it to settle and see what happens :( glad I am not holding calls though.

No one else but Tesla is booking $8,000 OTA software upgrades in the automotive space. That is pure profit, and it’s more than an iPhone user will spend with Apple in their entire lifetime. 

If Apple was growing as fast as Tesla: Apple had revenue of $260b last year, would hit $415b this year, then $665b next year.
Google Xiao Jianhua if you guys want to know what happen to billionaire if they get on China bad side.

TLDR; the guy is worth over 6 billions and China kidnapped him from Hong Kong in 2017. No trial, no nothing they just kidnapped a billionaire.
This is a lot more work than a blow job.

Yes that is how I knew they had a desk set at his resort but he called it off
I have shares and LEAPs on NOK.

I have LEAPs on T.
I don't think we know specifically what set it off, maybe the ANT ipo, maybe not. Still, feels planned and deliberate. But the Chinese government not happy with Jack. And this is not bullshit like here in the West. They *will* make clip his wings.
I try to keep <5% of my money in options
imagine being cash gang LOL poors
I worked in the industry for 14 years
buy the dip...i thought the same when it hit 24k earlier this month...damn thing is going mooooooooooooooon

- 2x 12/31 riot 14c

Let me know how retarded u think
This
Give it to me, I'll take real good care of it /s

Basically:

1. Essentially, you're playing the opposite side of a traditional "buy option --> sell option" trade. You're paid a premium for taking on the "risk" of having your shares of a stock called away and given to someone else or being forced to buy shares at a price you choose. You're the one who will sell to open and buy to close (seems confusing, but trust me it's not). The thing is, as long as you are selling those options for the shares above the price you bought them at, you're profiting no matter what, in a sense.

2. Volatile stocks, or better said stocks with high implied volatility (IV) have the best premiums. Stuff like GME, PLTR, and other meme stocks have lots of retail speculators willing to pay higher premiums for the chance to hit it big. Basically they're holding a burning lottery ticket that we've sold them. You *could* do it on SPY but since SPY is around $37,000 required to play either side, most people will just stick with stocks in the $10-50 range since it allows you to diversify pretty well but also focus on higher IV stocks. Right now I am selling options on AAL, CCL, PLTR, FSR, ACB and a few others. The great thing about selling options is that when you "lose" you still kind of win, and when you win you win more than you planned for originally. It's really rare and really hard to actually take a large loss.

The drawbacks are that you can't get an insane slam dunk 100000% gain like you see on a lot of WSB posts and that you'll basically always be managing your portfolio and rotating things in and out. It's a sort of active investment strategy for people who don't care about getting $100,000 in one day but instead just want $1000 in one week. For me, it's a way to escape the 9-5 and still get the thrill of being an active trader.
Stimulus is fine but I just got $8500 by this stimulus passing, for people on unemployment this is big. Not only does it get extended (mine ran out next week) but add another $300 each week to it. That's so much extra money this is great lol.
Patience Loves Total Redemption. Up 10% eow

You’re talking about that GME guy from today too right? lol
Hot damn! Guess I won't be selling off first thing in the morning after all!
Isn’t the cutoff is 75k which isn’t really shit? Definitely not upper class in most metros
invest in BABA and winnie can come in at any moment and take your money🤭
Thanks, needed the inspiration right now.

You apparently can't buy warrants but RH has assured users that they will get the warrants when the merger happens. Email them for details.
Easier if you use desktop. Go to the My Accounts tab. In the drop down menu go to Transaction history. You can sort by holdings, year, ytd, transaction type etc. 

Also on same page you can click on Cost basis summary which helps with gains and losses, tax lots

Exactly. But he clearly doesnt care enough cuz his job is almost up. But the market should still move now that the bill is actually signed

The tontine structure is also enticing going forward when it comes to warrants and more shares and therefore more dividends in 10 years when this thing is handing out a 10% yield. Use your head.

Down like 5% in Shanghai right now I believe. Not looking good for call holders.

EDIT: Down 5% in HK markets haha I cannot geography.
If you sell, be careful of recaptured depreciation. Also might be worth living in a place for 2 years before selling so you can claim it as a primary resident and won't need to pay on 500k of capital gains.

Okay, my b lol. Your confidence really convinced me you were one of the stupid doomers in this thread.
tesla hasnt mooned this year because they make luxury cars. They mooned because they are going to take over all automated cars, taxis and trucking, they essentially monopolized the production of automated cars in the sense that they own some of the most valuable intellectual property and patents required to realize this wave of automation. They also have a huge headstart in data collection which is equally as valuable.

It had nothing to do with margins. Bezos continued to deeply invest in the company's future instead of letting the profits roll. This is why many shareholders were pissed for years because it was clear that AMZN could profit and they wanted to see a return.

This is why the AMZN comparison to almost any other stock is retarded. Amazon wasn't bleeding money out the eyeballs at any point. Almost every company that gets the AMZN comparison is.

It’s the charging infrastructure.  Teslas are the only cars you can reliably drive cross country.  There’s a supercharger at many rest stops and they only work in Teslas.

Ah ok
It didn’t last week. 225 12/31 opened at 425 & hit 1788 at its peak. Barely dipped from what it opened at , I’ll get out of it goes wrong but if you’re not on anything else rn I think it’s a decent play to see 30-50% gains . Search up historical option prices & check baba to see what I’m talking about . I just remember vividly because I knew it was a decent move & got sidetracked, so pissed lol

Why? It will bottom on this week I bet. My guess is 33-35 range. Sell some long dated calls if your scared. I got 1100 for a Dec 21 90c
I feel like all you autists who bought the BABA dip don't know how the CCP work. They usually don't care what a company do as long as they get their bribe. However when they want a company or someone gone then they will do whatever it takes. Jack Ma might need to flee China to stay alive if it gets really bad over there.

You can talk stocks a LOT with people but don't push it at them. Like, just drop it casually, "Oh I do some trading in stocks and sometimes options". See if they bite. If not, leave it alone because there is nothing worse than talking stocks at a person who cannot possibly care any leas about anything in the universe.

The US stock market influences the Hang Seng, not the other way around. HK BABA usually trades a little lower than BABA on the NYSE so I think its just catching up to the sell off in the US as of now. I would say its only down very little if at all.

I agree that FEYE is a momentum play - I think the post makes that clear. I wouldn't even plan to hold it to earnings call. The strange part about it is the relatively large influx of institutional money last week. If the pre-market is up tomorrow and the stimulus gets passed, then the pressure on FEYE up will not be rational.

FTNT was the biggest surprise I found. Fundamentals are reasonable and the p/e hasn't gotten out of control yet.

PANW was another positive - but with the run-up and increasing IV, it's not a good options play. I would just buy shares.

They've done over 125 million (i forget the exact number) in revenue (IP and design work with Hyundai), over 50 crash tests, and their team has a lot of manufacturing experience (BMW), i.e. they are further along than any other EV company at this stage. 

2021 will be the release of the last mile delivery vehicles (we believe) and the first personal vehicles will be available in 2022. They have been teasing their sports vehicle and pick up truck versions as well as a dope af RV camper version.

They are starting to step up their marketing so we'll all find out soon, but you can always watch the Leno interview [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FIViMSeigM&t=335s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FIViMSeigM&t=335s).

No more stim talks until the next flash crash!! It’s finally over for now
Just as retarded as OP.
If no 2k carrot still dangling we would have dropped at open guaranteed
Anyone with a brain knew the $2000 were never going to happen. This is a surprise he signed it.
Could be extremely wrong but doesn’t HK usually track us? Or is baba just not adjusting to our markets movement Thursday
I love ICLN, but thank you for showing me PBW! It had definitely outperformed which at a glance is because it has NIO which I believe ICLN does not. Either way clean energy is going to continue to rally for the next decade or so IMO

OP is 16 & lives w parents
Did that last week
If China can kill BABA I'd be worried about investing in anything over there (unless it's wholly state owned, I guess.)
Good luck but you don’t need it with Dec calls.
Or don’t have shitty parents that steel your money. I had 18k as an 18 year old and my mother made an excuse to squeeze money out from my account year after year. Then when I decided I no longer think she has good intentions and took over my account, there was only 5k left. She wasn’t even poor, she made $65/hr and owned a 650k house. She was just very greedy. I’m pretty pissed thinking about if things were different, but what’s done is done. Now I have my education a good job and invested whatever I could and I saved quite a bit to where I’m comfortable.
Get back in the kitchen grandma.
I’m long cvs 75C 8/21/21 literally all 9k of my bankroll gotta stick with this
That feels like a decade ago. Lol. Wayfair.

Stimulus is more than the check you get to buy you and your 5 kids McDonald's with.

It's unemployment, funds to keep small business from dying more than it has already, and other shit that gives people confidence to spend instead of save for fucking toilet paper just in case something like a pandemic kills all of the toilet paper farms.
Pffft value, right

$ICLN been looking very solid. Clean energy hype should keep running it up!

I'll have you guys know that I've been bearish this entire year, but I literally just went in 100%. Prepare for red dildos.
prices at close get fucked up sometimes especially for dogshit stonks like CLDR

bidders/sellers may remove their orders at 3:59pm so RH just uses the avg of bid+ask to calculate the price you see on your screen

can't reliably tell the price until market opens, maybe 9:31am.
All in myself + NP-A
We all gotta learn crush the hard way
Just leave it man. Don’t keep throwing money on a fire lol
Predictions on ABNB tomorrow?
Learn a trade if it  interest you. The ability for self-employment is always there too.
Both good. PBW has NIO and JKS.  ICLN IS PLUG and ENPH.  who u like more
Seen a post on here like last tuesday saying experts think XL should have an Avg. Strike price of $60. Trade volume was at 90m on thursday & it dipped. Will rise again this week. If u want to yolo short it since you're using a credit card. Im selling at 40

You guys do realize NIO is gonna be atleast $100 per share before 2022 right? If the chinese pumpers took GSX past $100 this year then you better believe the CCP and its shell pumpers will pump the fuck outta this national treasure of theres. Do with this info as you please.

He's turning investing on its head!
I’ve used margin to leverage gains when I had sub 20k. Really didn’t see a negative to using it when I was confident about my trades. Especially in this hyper bull market it’s almost free money
Need a 5% day from NET tmw or my stimulus check is gone
I am still so confused. But if it helps I’m mango
I’m in Walmart right now, and I need some probiotic yogurt(not Activia, that shits nasty🤮) what should I get?
Shit, who the hell knows. He’s driven by ego, so my guess is he thought ‘boy, they’d love me if I could say I got them $2k,’ he tried, GOP didn’t go for it, so he tried waiting them out. But not signing after the deadline would have meant no $600 either, plus everything else in the stimulus which would’ve gotten him some hate even from his base. And likely would’ve been his last act as president, not exactly how he’d want to go out.
Doesn’t matter. If you can’t make $2,000 with another 6 months of “market rises on stimulus hopes” then you’re retarded. Trump just gave us a fucking GIFT on his way out.
Are same race couples illegal in movies, tv, and ads now? Good thing my wife's bf is black or id be fucked.
Yep, that's how all foreign investment starts with China. Trick is to make sure the barbarians don't actually have any foothold through thorny things like legal ownership, so better to make everything run through illegal shell corps so you can just disavow when convenient.
You’re stupid
I gotta read more on how closely US & China markets correlate on the stock . More of a play off of how China is still dumping, believe there’s more bad news that was released on it today courtesy of Bloomberg, gotta double check. Will be a long night reading & thinking though

On the App Store (apple) it’s been #2-#3 overall behind YouTube and tiktok. D+ is around 7th and Netflix 9th. There’s a big ad for WW and hbomax front and center on the home page and I saw this morning that WW is the top box office movie of the pandemic.  

They’re also working with space point on satellite based service essentially eliminating dead zones. That’s a few years away but space point is going public via SPAC right now and more info on that may emerge. 

With direct to streaming releases and satellite cell phone service, we’re looking at two big disruptive catalysts on the horizon. It’s a boomer dividend stock right now so options are cheap af. I have a feeling this will pull boomers, MM, and retards alike in the next couple months.

If they’re thin volume, then the bid/ask spread is likely wide resulting in odd pricing.

Timing it though. Theta doesn't play nice.

See you on the other side, berlinwall.
It’s 3 dollars below US close.
As someone who bought shares at 18, these diamond hands are waiting to let go at 70.
Why do people actively want 2k stimmy when all it does is end up widening the wealth gap and increasing the rate of asset inflation?   


You people are so easily bought off when you should say fuck your stimmy and fuck the FED and stop the manipulation so you actually have a chance at organic wealth creation instead of begging the gov. for it.   


I'd rather we not kick the can down the road to save boomer retirements. I'd rather not destroy the dollar to pay for boomer mistakes. I'd rather have a chance at the same American dream they did, but nah, gimme my trump bucks and I'll go back to getting economically shit on until us poors get uppity again and maybe we can get some mroe handouts. Shit is so short sighted.
So that means we expect US BABA to tank on open tmrw

The surprise shouldn't be how much they make. It should be that they're still employed. If I fucked my code up as much as they fucked up recently, I'd be selling handies behind Arby's.
Mostly because you can’t post SPACs or tickers with under 1b market cap on here or it pulls them.  I have about 10 others that I personally think will 🚀 but to avoid pump and dumps they don’t allow it which I respect.

Yea the interviewer on cnn interviewed the “work together caucus” that work with both sides of the aisle to get things passed they’ve been working on this all year and they confirmed what Tommrow might entail.

They boutta fu k around and find out

If I upvote this it makes it true right?
You don’t. You just don’t .
No one is criticizing an individual choice on calls versus commons. Both are perfectly reasonable. I wouldn't buy Jan calls to be safe. June, Dec calls are where the BIG money is. Especially Dec because when this thing pops, its gunna be even poppier in Dec. And just as a normal risk reward move, buying all options is perhaps on the higher end of risk here. Commons are safe plus you get Tontine.

You think its to late to buy in
Yea but the pressure on republicans is very very serious with the Georgia run off race underway. Optics are looking worse and worse for republicans. So if they say no and dems pass it in the house that’s more negative pressure back on them.

I work as a systems administrator. Does that count? 🤣
So I take it that it would be an extremely risky strategy that would also require a pretty significant move to make it very profitable? Thoughts on this as a potential way for me to profit from the squeeze?

Lol, BABA. Have you retards not learned back in April with $LK?
For $600 or more?
Why is baba getting cucked? I’m thinking about going heavy on it for my 2021 strat and sell off my stupid fucking value stocks
They are a solid company and they are supported by Quebec. For public transportation there is a lot of competition in the space, including canada with a chinese plant in ontario and also volvo (im inclined to think they will buy lion electric). But in the other product offerings they can dominate and are expanding to the US with new positions as well.
really?
who’s your weed guy
Anyone with fd calls gonna be up about 50-60% at open easily

Only trading advice you'll ever need
I fuck trailer trash so I usually am not dealing with teeth.
Got it off a hair drier
Obvious support at $219 or so which is great. We would want to see the new low to be ABOVE $222 or so, that would really show life. It needs to hold and break this 50EMA to really be a viable option at this price though. RSI is fair. Stochastic says it is going to reverse green with a divergence. Vortex has room to drop so it may keep dropping a little more. 

What is a good sign is the resistance at $233 or so is strong, so once it breaks that it'll be a good support. I would love to see it come down to $220 again for a fantastic entry, or if it lives with a higher low of $223 that is also good.

TLDR: Good for long term, short term needs to play out for actual direction but it is a good deal.

Story time ... jack ma initially tried to partner up with al lthe majors banks in chy-nah. They see all these small instant loans / credit lines are little to none profitable... so all these national banks told him to go kick rocks. Years later when Alipay became big that’s when Chinese government started Union Pay, which like Visa . Their credit card/lending programs are garbage compared to BABA’s . They just bunch jelly little batches and trying to steal his tendies man

Another amazing comment. How can you people be so blind.

Just look at the world around you to answer that question.

The stock is up 30% from IPO atm. No announcement. Hmmmm. Why.... think about it...

I am confident in the pre-merger run up because its happening before my eyes. Go look at the chart, I mean come on guys.

This thing popped 5% on Wednesday. It has made steady 1-2% gains weekly for the last 12 weeks with several days of 2-5% up. It has suffered no big down days (over 2% down). Just wake up and look at all the facts.

***Last Wednesday's 5% pop on that 500K share buy is the canary in the coal mine, mark my fucking words.***
Use white strips dawg
thanks for the old news
Moon at open, followed by immediate sell off, followed by buying the entire day or some shit like that
Charge point only legit ev network imo
I'm not really sure I'd agree. The fancy technology and AI driving really have nothing to do with developing an electric car. Those may be the future of the industry but it's not necessary to have in a car electric or otherwise. The real tech in an electric car is the battery pack. An electric motor is not changing anytime soon just like the ICE isn't either. Tesla's current batteries aren't very special either and they still don't have the capability to manufacture their own in quantity. 

Tesla is like apple tho, they're selling a sexier version of an existing product (iphone vs flip phone). No one needed an iphone in 2007 when it came out, it was just super cool to have. It took a few years but every other manufacturer can make smartphones. If they can keep selling the tesla as a status symbol like apple then that's money but don't pretend they have some secret sauce.  Now if the battery day technology actually pans out then they would be decades ahead in battery tech but that's pretty out there.
jesus
Hell even more than that if you sell at open and buy at close it always pops right at Pre-Market. But you've got to get them orders filled quickly
Fuck BABA glad I dumped that shit...Chinese stocks can die in a fire

Why is $MT sp way cheaper now than it was before the 08 bull run?

prices at close get fucked up sometimes especially for dogshit stonks like SBUX

bidders/sellers may remove their orders at 3:59pm so RH just uses the avg of bid+ask to calculate the price you see on your screen

can't reliably tell the price until market opens, maybe 9:31am.

Lol. Get off my nuts f4ggot show your gains or STFU
There is a lot of lithium in the earth’s crust, all over the place. The difficulty is that it’s not always in a form that is easy to isolate. For example Musk recently indicated that he has some land in Nevada where he plans to do his own lithium mining. In Nevada, the lithium is in clay, and it’s my understanding that it’s really difficult (ie, not cost-effective) to pull out of clay. If Musk’s engineers have figured out a way, that would be huge. 

It would make other types of batteries much less attractive (unless very cheap and high energy density, which is certainly possible), and would force lithium recycling to compete on cost with newly extracted lithium. 

On the other hand, as long as Musk’s companies hold the (hypothetical) patent on the clay extraction process, recycling and alternative chemistries remain very interesting.  

In any case, however, lithium ion batteries are a mature and ubiquitous technology. If they are replaced, it will have to be done by something extremely good, and it would take time. I mean, if we are limiting ourselves to the world of electrochemical cells. Fuel cells could disrupt the entire ball game, as could betavoltaic cells (see for example recent developments in C14 diamond batteries). 

I foresee more of an ecosystem of different battery technologies and other types of energy storage for different uses. Lithium and/or fuel cells and/or betavoltaic cells may continue to dominate the portable & transportation sectors for a long time, but I think we will see the home powerwall replaced with something safer and cheaper (maybe an iron flow battery for example). Same with utility-scale. Anything where weight & volume is not a principal concern, lithium is at a disadvantage. Biodegradable and even ingestible batteries have another niche. 

Imagine the world ~80 years ago, when people were saying, hey look, we can make a few different kinds of plastic more easily now, and there are lots of different uses. That’s where I think we are with energy storage technologies today.
But GOEV instead. Higher ceiling

That's the separate bill - 2021 spending. If you take all the foreign aid out of it and gave towards stimulus check, it would be only like 50$ bigger. To give 120 million americans extra 1400 - you need 168bn. Foreign aid was less than 5bn. Don't  listen to demagogues, do simple math

just do it pussy
You say it’s priced in , I say it’s the only the beginning ... with investigators implemented, limiting their ability of lending , new regulations... it will tank at least couple more weeks and will pump back up before earnings . Q4 for BABA will be monster. TaoBao , TMall and Alipay is Jack Ma’s primary source of income ... without Alipay’s lending program , ant group will go under , so is for Baba
Thinking of getting some ARKG leaps

Also god speed fellow retard.
theres not much volume

i do think theres room for this to move up more though, the june calls look good but again, not much volume
I’ll post that after open lol
Thanks a ton for sharing. This is really helpful for where I am in my journey. I really needed to see this.

One quick question - once you have a good thesis set on a stock, do you simply buy in or do you still have to wait to time a good entrance? I missed several good opportunities because I waited for them to drop or hit support but they left without me.

Ackman has been clear the pool of contenders is over 150 companies. In Sept he publicly revealed that PSTH has identified 50 potential targets and would spend the next 6 months working to make a deal with one of them.

The likelihood here is that he has 10-15 companies begging him to make a deal and then another 5 or so he is mating dancing with (Stripe, Bloomberg, InNout).

SEC reg requires 10 days to file. He filed on the following Monday with the last shares bought on Friday (3 days). Using this logic, if he continued to buy shares last week (because why stop after 4 consecutive days?) then I'd anticipate a filing tomorrow morning PM. We get another filing and we blast off. Obligatory GME to moon 🌚 🚀 🚀 🚀
If you consider half a percent ripping.
Not as bad as it sounded here
100 shares? Time to sell some covered calls and don't be a bitch, learn from your mom.
BABA is green in the US market rn.  215 is equivalent to US closing price.  Nobody expected it to open green in HK lol.
Its really something isnt it? The secret sauce is... stonks only up
I'm gonna hold them for a couple more quarters to capture any additional recovery rally then dump them.

r/options is that way. Ban
I really hope. My body is ready for tendies. $8k put on the line.
There’s literally no way I’d hold my shares that long if it even started doing that. I’m not even ashamed to admit I’d have 📄🙌
And then it’s possible both pass? So an additional $2600?
Are you retarded?
Ticker is 9988.HK, it's available at yahoo finance. BTW its down another 4.5%

what website do you check for futures?

I check this and its pretty boring - [https://www.cnn.com/business/markets/premarkets](https://www.cnn.com/business/markets/premarkets)
PLTR pattern is starting to become super predictable. Calls at Friday close then sell around midweek. Reload Friday.
By "moon" you mean ["to move or spend time in a way that shows a lack of care and interest and no clear purpose"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/moon)?

Yes, AMZN will moon tomorrow.
I’m about to call hk 9988’s manger if I don’t get a moon shot here shortly

I got 230 calls for march. I couldn't believe how cheap they were on friday. Anti-trust investigations never seem to do anything long term so I hope this one was just a BTFD moment.
Not with call leaps lol. If the market pumps 100% on inflation you can make 400% with leaps
NO FUCK WAY DUDE 

THAT WOULD MAKE THE STOCK TANK !!!

Oh i know i just want to know how long they will dangle the carrot over the market. Trying to see what calls to play while they pump Stim talks going well again.
Yuuuuup
lol this will just sell-off at open. Every time futures are overhyped it sell-off because Americans are pussies, the only way they'll buy if it's flattish green

SPY 375c for Jan?
Trump is a retard and got pressured into losing his only leverage because Mitch "promised" to investigate voter fraud, and consider a section 230 repeal lmao.  What a fucking moron.  I wonder how Trump land is spinning him getting cucked so hard into a positive.
So is that it for stimulus talks going well?

So, get the current share price/7.78 then multiply by 8
Lol BABA down another 5%. What had everyone so confident.
600😒  
  
Edit* House just passed the $2000 one too. So $600, then if the senate passes -> second check for $1400
PLTR has 2 catalysts in Jan.  one on 7th and the other 26th. should get a good pump from both. this is without any contract announcements. also earnings will be early Feb so it should pump end of Jan. If earnings smashes. this thing is going to $40. so the question is in this environment do we think they signed a bunch of contracts with other countries for covid? my bet is yes.

Hed been in a meeting for a few hours today @ Maralago with lawyers begging him to sign it, they must have convinced him.
Why?
Yes
Welcome to tendie town, my friend.
This market has rallied like all month on stimulus talks. Market during futures goes down almost 1% when orange said he wasn’t signing it, but then opened green as fuck on 2k stimulus talks same day. Now he says he signing it with the $600 and the market rallies again like it’s a big surprise and he declares victory?

Yeah I’m buying SPY 400C 06/21 and not looking until February. I’m sure they will be ITM then. 🙄🙄
Wait is it official he signed the same bill lmao
What steel did they use in the cages Joe!
Donald Pump's last act
The CNN reporter said it's likely Mitch McConnell and Trump agreed to some terms that ultimately persuaded Trump to sign the current bill. The 2K could be the final amount or not depending on the senate voting, primarily Mitch's stance. I highly doubt we'll get 2K. The senate wants as less as possible for these one time payouts, we're lucky they even agreed to 600; it could have very well been 500 or even measly 300 bucks.

I have a Honda brand TV though.
Hate to dampen the spirits with bad news but the strain on hospitals, and the quickest daily rise in rona cases here in the UK, is now at its worst since the first wave of the virus in March. Apparently thanks to the new strain of the virus hastening transmission, coupled with the holiday season and everyone ignoring the guidelines around Christmas there will be bumps in the recovery to "normal". That's if we get there at all in the short term and just get used to a new normal.

There are still potential bumps down the line so don't go too gung ho on recovery stocks like CCL, IMO at least.

Then again when people do start returning to normal life these kind of plays have clear upside potential. 

I know it's difficult but play safe retards.
they are completely sold out

So, you'd rather buy a 40k car that costs you gas and maintenance every year than a 40k car that costs you jackshit - the electricity to run it, the wiper fluid, and the occasional tire replacement - gets better via downloading free software updates, depreciates by maybe 5 percent a year and may appreciate once they solve FSD, accelerates faster than a Ferrari, and can drive itself well enough that you don't need to worry about stop and go traffic on commutes?

Depends if they live in a state with a functioning unemployment system, or they live in a state where it takes 6+ months to get your unemployment approved. 

Also, it’s an extra $300 from the Fed per week, not $600. The $600 is for the checks.

Oil needs to be found, drilled, pumped, transported, *refined into gas*, transported, sold, and burned to make energy. 

*Interestingly enough, the step “refine into gasoline” is powered by electricity!*

The amount of electricity it takes to **refine** one gallon of gas is the amount of electricity it takes to drive an EV 30 miles. 

All the other steps above are waste. 

EVs are so much more efficient it’s absurd.

Market had inside knowledge last week that Trump was not going to sign, that's why it dove Sunday night despite news being "Covid bill passes"

Market tonight knew Trump was going to sign for at least $600, that's why it hulked up to 3700+. $2000 would be breaking up above recent range

Without this stimmy bill, we never would have had the spending bill come into the spot light. Just goes to show you the amount of shit that routinely goes down that no one knows about.
The 20 cards can't compete with the price of the 30 cards. An alternative to the 30 cards would be 10 cards which don't support Raytracing. Raytracing is going to get way more common in games so buying a new 10 card doesnt make much sense if you are in to gaming.
sell the news
Do you think the narrative changes with the approved 600 dollars? Like congress will use this as a reason not to pass the 2k bill? This is all just political games and every action always has an ulterior motive to it.

$50 calls about 3 months out
Sorry if this is spammy but I want to be serious about something I made a quick joke about earlier. I linked a [video](https://youtu.be/0Grs_jJ5U6w) of a guy with an IQ around 75 talking about what his level of disability is like and I said I might hire him to manage my trades. I just wanna clarify that I wasn't making fun of him, I was being sincere about him and making fun of myself. I kinda wanted to bring it up again to say, jokes aside, I feel like that guy might have a hidden trading ability. The way he described his difficulties, it seems like he'd have a hard time knowing when to hold and when to sell, but he'd probably be really good at knowing when to buy. He seems like his level of comprehension is at just the right level to be able to understand the market to a basic extent without overthinking it. Being incapable of overthinking your analysis seems to me like a fucking superpower. I really hope it's clear that I'm not trying to insult the guy because I mean this sincerely. Someone with what they call borderline retarded IQ might be the chosen one to take on the Wall St institutional traders of today. I don't think I have to say much more than that because a lot of you probably get exactly what I mean. And I don't just mean that guy, I mean someone at that level of brain function in general. Though maybe it is more unique to that guy in the video than I realize.
Got it - One more thing. 

I read in the comments that it will be a 1:1 split. So, for arguments sake, if you owned 105 commons pre-merger, would you now have 210 commons post-merger with the availability to warrants on the original 105?

If the 230 gets out, that shit is passing. They’ve been after that for a long while. But yeah, don’t see Dems caving in. They wouldn’t give trump the corporate liability measure.
NVTA and AAPL for sure, maybe fomo into MARA/RIOT, maybe XL.
Can they do that 100 times?
Damn. Most of the gains I’ve gotten so far were from anticipating shit I thought nobody else would expect. My GME play might be the nail in the coffin for me. I’m down 90% and there’s no way in hell I’m closing. I’ll probably sell some puts though like you said.

I hope it’s not subway but if it is, it’s not a compete disaster. Bill was successful at taking Burger King public and I would suggest people look at chipotles share price right now

Lol to everyone who is downvoting me for pointing out the truth that Mitch McConnell is the de facto president of America. I’ve never seen any sub worse than WSB for downvoting things they don’t want to hear even if they’re true. It’s been this way for two years now here.

Repressed religious nuts are always the craziest
Selling one put gives you exposure to 100 shares. It may be easier to think of them as separate transactions. You are netting the premium from the short puts, which brings your break even down to strike price - premium. In this case, you are using that premium to purchase calls, which essentially brings your break even higher by the amount you spend on the calls (break even is now put strike - put premium + money spent on call premiums). Ultimately though your downside exposure is 100x the amount of puts you have sold in shares.
Yeah but if US go under nobody buys Chinas crap they make

bears still saying sell the news LMFAOOO CLOWNS
The market has stopped believing his bullshit.
Yes absolutely. You’ve said the 3 most important things when trading options are delta, gamma and theta. I can’t even imagine looking at an option disregarding IV. In fact if I had to choose only one variable that’s definitely IV. 

Delta you can kind of feel it by the distance to the strike and expiry. Gamma is just a derivative. Theta same story you can feel it by how far you are to expi. But IV is pivotal. IV is the real price of options.

If anything made sense I would agree with you, but the last true sell the news event was when Trump was in the hospital tweeting and said something that caused a mini CB. Which turned out to be a dip that got bought up for when he walked it back. In short, unless he gets to twitter we safe

HOLY shit he is gonna sign it !!
The fuck was all that 2,000$ bullshit then??

For fucken sake man
I didn't say they were nor implied anything correlating to moral superiority. I just stated how one party can do messed up stuff and smile in your face and it's ok and the other party does messed up stuff too but won't insult your intelligence by smiling in your face but rather just be brutally honest. 
This has nothing to do with Trump, we're talking about political parties and YOU keep trying to make it about Trump.  

I despise Biden with a passion but I haven't brought him up once (other than right now) cause this wasn't about presidents it was solely about political parties.
Only thing I'm not certain on here is what loi stands for

Nice! My March 25s are also very green!
I could not figure out mango's motivation for delaying the signing of the bill.  Then coming in here I realized it:  the pump from it would be so much smaller if he'd signed It Christmas eve, so he waited until tonight when it would cause a solid, noticeable bump Monday morning.

same, i’d much rather have a divided government where basically nothing happens but i think the 2k stimmy check is likely with either because the senate will only hold a max 2 seat majority for the reds and 1 seat majority for the blues
MSTR has a forward PE of less than 60. That means the 2000x PE isn’t reflective of normal operations. If you’re going to make a meme joke, at least do it right.

MasterCard announced boost in holiday numbers, e-commerce grew over 40% this year. Amazon will probably release info about the holiday sales tonight or tomorrow premarket. Riding this up and then waiting for pull back, going close otm calls for earnings after pullback
So you’re a grower?

Can’t tell if its a bull case for AAPL or TSLA.
Bigly GREEN this week right?
nothing changed so yah
They keep stock price up by buying and flashing buy walls.

They do this so they don’t have to payout put holders.
Buy gme if it dips
No you haven't. You really should stop lying on the internet.
How are you not already all in if you do that though? Would run out of money to buy dips if you buy every dip.
oh right ignore a play that has a verified commodity price behind it confirming its bullishness and go invest in a video game store or over-valued EV company instead...
Of course. I just looked up average height and didn't realize I'm average at 5'9" wow, life changing
Saddest thing is she probably genuinely believes shes a good trader
What’s GME doing tmrw
the biggest mistake new traders make is they think a stock that has run alot wont run higher. in fact its the opposite.

no one gave a fuck about it when it was a SPAC. This has only been trading for 2 days under its ticker.
If they in college they're getting $10k pretty soon (unless they paid for it themselves like 🤡🤡🤡)
Only Trump can spend a week railing against a bill he calls terrible and then sign it unchanged and call it good news. And then his followers adjust all their beliefs so that this makes perfect sense to them

What does Bull mean?

A bull is the third party brought into a cuckold relationship, meant to have sex with one partner while the other partner feels both humiliated and turned on. A bull is generally seen as a more attractive, better endowed, sexually virile man with incredible sexual talents.
I love how it's like "we acknowledge that our core business is going to evaporate very soon so we're moving to adjacent market where almost all competitors have already failed" and this is bullish to wsb.

I'm bittersweet on a blue wave. On one hand, more spending will happen which will no doubt pump the markets. But at the same time it opens the doors for more regulation with the lack of gridlock, which might hinder growth.

Off the insane possibility he would take us into shutdown cause his feelings hurt. That’s what would scare the markets. Stimulus was a token. 2k was an empty gesture that cost him nothing. 600 ain’t moving anyone’s needle.
I’m just saying; you don’t even know the reason why AOL imploded, it’s an uninformed opinion.

Because if you don’t know what cause the self destruction, how can you even try to accurately compare it to a completely different company?

who else buying XL now lol
because its a 'half measure'. it actually makes profits. a full transition to EV over night is not happening. hybrids will be ubiquitous before the full transition. big business knows that. which is why hyliion, lordstown etc are all in the gutter and this one is already $30.
I am glad I went against my nature and bought a little more.

$600 is really weak tbh....
How much is BFT hitting this week?

I mean... it’s down on bullish news, so buy the dip?
I bought some puts on NKLA for fun, but not as an investment. I won't ever do any pure shorting, but puts have a limited downside which I appreciate.

All cars will go electric soon-ish, so I expect a few of them to make it, but I'd also expect to see a number of other automakers go bust, so I'd personally play puts on the majors rather than the new entrants. The high IV of new entrants makes for less leverage and the older OEMs are more likely to run into major issues, whereas new entrants can find enough funding from VCs to stay afloat longer than the incumbents.

That being said, I'm not in any of those positions, so take that all with a large grain of salt.

What are you saying? You'd go to prison for a year as long as you got to keep 900k?
Completely depends on whether they call a redemption. If the stock was high enough you may considering selling some before the merger to cover the warrants. That is up to you. Most people are going to do the math if going all in though, and have the $23 for every 9 commons they have to cover it.
Not terrible

Well I paid off some cards, bought new carpet, next step is another card, but sometimes I also buy shares.
its only been trading as XL for 2 trading days retard. this is early as it gets. not anyone tracks the hundreds of SPACs non stop. the institutional ownership is still incredibly low because of how new it is.
BB moon when
Tendies on the way my friend
Are we corrupting them, or are they finally becoming cool like us? 😎😎😎
I tried to man, it’s just more stressful to “time” puts. Better to wait for dips and buy calls, also, puts are generally more expensive than calls and sometimes it’s not worth it
Green or Red tm?
Weekends suck now...true😭

Go ask your wife's bf.
600
Can anyone who's up to date on IRL house of cards tell me why trump decided to sign it?
I fucking hope so
Started with Betterment, it sucked very hard. Switched to M1 finance for individual stocks in early 2019 and things went well. I was up a staggering 8% for the year right before March. Sold all of my holdings on March 4 and bought 3x leveraged bear shares. I didn't play this very well but instead of losing 30% of my portfolio value I gained a few more percent.

On March 4 my account balance was $6500, by August I got it up to 10k. Today I am sitting at 30k with 9k of that being margin. So I guess I doubled my account. Up 98% YTD, money-weighted.

I'm also down about 4.5k in options so all together maybe 50% gain YTD
No 2k not like I needed it but yeah quite disappointing. I guess both sides didn't want a shutdown according to the press.
BFT $60 right now in Nepal
Revised my QS cash secured put. Now going ATM. 20 contracts. Will post my gains on Thursday................ Who deserves the Medal of Freedom, my accountant. He’s been hula hooping through loop holes, working 'round shit.

When I put this in on Robinhood, it says "Are you expecting to receive a credit or pay a debit for this option?" which do I choose? Because I would like to buy 10 of these for fun
I’m assuming this is a joke. The amount of money that would need to be poured into dogecoin would have to be in the trillions for that to happen. Long story short def not happening
So is stim 600 or 2000?
Yeah idk why they disappeared or what caused that, but I’m thinking I’ll snag a few 23’s and a 25
Not our fault your sister’s retarded
I was drunk in Buenos Aires and accidentally drank out of the bidet.
Don’t worry bro, you can use margin for the other 1400

Wow.  This thread is 10x better on wsbsynth.

Started with 10K in June. Doubled in a week to 20. Lost it. Hovered from 5-10K. Went down to 2K about 7 weeks ago playing BJs. YOLOd on PLUG. Back to 5K. Turned 5K into 15K playing ICLN and ARK ETF monthlies before they became meme stocks. 

Saw an amazing play. YOLOd 15K on ITM monthly on a SPAC trading near NAV. Up 50K. Riding it to 100+K in the next couple weeks. 

Will never play anything but SPACs again.
There's a lot of affordable places to live. People just choose to live where they cannot afford and depend on the hard work of others (landlords) to provide housing they can rent at a more affordable price. It's absolutely ridiculous  to be providing affordable housing and have to deal with degenerates on top of that. I can't figure out why landlords put up with it when there's so much better things they could be doing with that capital.

How many shmeckles? 2k or 600?
Did u do that ? And did it smell all that shit just chilling there like a bears with puts ?
I feel like trump doesn’t really care. MY THEORY is that he used that 2k stimmy to distract people from all the pardoning he has been doing past week. Otherwise, why would he suddenly care about the bill after it was finished? I mean he hadn’t taken any action for half a year now

Allow me to go full retard for a second because I'm still learning. How much risk is it if I want to sell naked puts and just buy more calls? What expectation should I have? I'm specifically looking at the Apr 2021 calls/puts. I want to maybe catch the spike from Q4 earnings.

Alright boys, Biden is going to be in office within 1 month. What’s that old bag of shit going to do when he’s in office and what sectors will benefit the most? Right now I have $50,000 in cash which I’m looking to 20x by the end of ... well, Monday. Current companies I trade include FCEL, LAZR, VLDR, GOEV, PLTR.

I've seen the clips, not a believable explanation by Cramer, although its one he came up with afterwards in order to try to save his image from these imo unfair attacks. People dont call into his show asking if they should keep money at an institution, they ask for his opinion on certain stocks (you might glean some info about whether you should stay with an institution based on if their stock is in danger, but that certainly was not the point of Cramer's advice on Bear). Also, if you utilize the wealth management services of a place like Bear, you likely would have had well over $250k on deposit, which means the FDIC wont save you (past the first 250k)
**I hate to say this but when I crunch all the numbers I feel more confident in the China economy more than the US economy in the coming years. China is far less leveraged and has a healthy GDP/Debt ratio compared to US. Growth appears to be more organic in China when to take Debt and Credit into account. US on the other hand is Japan/Europe 2.0. They can only kick the can down the road so far, deleveraging works until it doesn't.**

The insanity on this subreddit is so alluring. When I first graduated (finance and Econ) even I fell into the peer pressure and lost a marginal amount of money on options.

My portfolio is safe. Slowly reducing tech positions into recovery stocks like Wynn, Boeing, Amex, Texas Roadhouse, etc. 

Though I hesitate to play at all. Zooming out on a macro level reveals inflationary measures in place across the spectrum and a gravely overdue sell off.

The stock price doesn’t matter. Your returns are always based on the total investment not on the number of shares you own. It’s the same argument as 1 lb of feathers and 1lb of steel. $10,000 worth of shares of MSFT is equal $10,000 worth of shares of Amazon.

Can I ask you two newbie questions?

1) My broker doesn't write 'put' or 'call'. I have 4 options: sell to close, sell to open, buy to open, buy to close. How do those terms match up with puts and calls?

2) Why volatile stocks? Why not just SPY? Is it just because of the potential to make more premiums? Because I'd personally rather risk buying SPY at 330 (for example) than end up bagholding some shitty pumped stock.

Sitting on a cash pile right now and would love a way to profit off that.

Amazon still haven't delivered the Christmas gift I ordered for my gf via amazon prime.

Was due the 23rd.

They ordered me $20 gift card compensation on Christmas day.

$ 40 today.

Will phone again tomorrow.

This is escalating pretty quickly, puts on Amazon.
So Trump signed the bill for $600?

It won't fix shit but it'll put a bandaid on things for a month or so. Smash & Grab boys, last one out the door gets cuffed!
They’re probably returning stuff to buy a few more boxes of ammo for when famous left wing radical Joe Biden comes for their guns, taking money from GME’s bottom line

I only bought 2 weeks ago and loaded up more last week- sounds like you have played this the same as I have jumped in and out of UAL a few times since April. I figure it will be a 6 month turn around but am fine with a premature pump or having to wait longer. Just seems like easy money if you don’t need the money for at least 12 months
Just the basic speedmaster moonwatch. It’s the one I liked the look of most even though it’s one the of the cheapest.

the GFC was incredibly complex and there were many contributing factors that stretch back decades, even as far back as the Great Depression. John Allison has a great book on the topic that is worth reading. Its sad how so many people can recite tropes of "wall street greed" and "under-regulation" and "complex derivatives" (essentially what you see Stewart doing here) while not understanding one iota of the underlying fiscal and monetary policies that created the whole mess.

Sure but it’s extremely unlikely they’ll become dominant in every one of these sectors. Their solar panel installations are a complete shitfest for example. All the bad installs that caused fires, to the extent that Walmart had to sue them to get everything replaced. And Panasonic recently bailed on their joint solar panel factory which doesn’t exactly scream super profitable growing venture.

I think they’ll do well with the cars and the batteries and even reasonably well in self driving. But the more fringe stuff is unlikely to make huge profits.

These people on here are insane with options. I did Chewy weekly to gain 2$ and hit. PLTR set me back 1,000 I nailed Moderna so hard both ways and it meant nothing. I was on a 7% run and lost 1.1% last two sessions. I can close out and reset and my realized will be over 8G but there are some I’m long and strong on like Z & CHWY. Up 32 on ABNB but it’s been loosing. I might ring the register on that one.

In short, they’re gonna have to pay more taxes. China said 🙅‍♂️to monopolies
throwing my $600 at baba calls fuck it.
How do you make people happy about getting $600 when they were hoping for $1200? Easy, just as you're about to give them the $600, you take it away and give them enough time to wish they had that $600, then you give it back to them.

So insurance, consumer lending might be in jeopardy.

And consumer lending is a thing where if you wanna buy something from alibaba, you can get a microloan from ant to buy it.

When you pay off that loan, your credit limit can increase.

Also, there's 0 percent interest for the first 40 days. So there's a lot of incentive to use loans. And it seems like it's a great way to increase revenue for alibaba

There will be businesses that did that for sure. But a lot of businesses could have saved that expense by laying off employees. Which was the main purpose of the bill. For these businesses it makes sense but I agree that there will be a ton that just got free money and got to deduct it too.
Nope.

Haha. I am almost there. This play ensures that status for me.
Update: witnessing first hand that stimulus talks have progressed well and it seems my wife's boyfriend will get his package stimulated tonight.
Unless he got an agreement from Moscow Mitch to hold a vote on the $2k amendment. And if they vote that down, Dems take the Senate and more stimulus arrives in February for sure.
Wait I already yolod 2k I thought we were getting, now it’s only 600?
Hang on- why would it be stripe?

Pls let me double my 5 dollars my moms boyfriend will be happy

Thanks I’m gonna go do a more thorough search. Kinda bullshit if business owners get to take the expense if they don’t have to pay back the loan, it’s not like you paid the payroll so you shouldn’t get the expense. Should be one or the other. You’re gonna have some businesses that took the loan even though they didn’t even need it, reduce their taxable income by over 100k in a lot of cases, and don’t have to pay the loan back? That’s crazy to me

Depends on the interest rate of the loan. Paying down a loan with 8% interest is a guaranteed 8% return on your money. Now, this is WSB and 8% return is for pussies, I don't even sell my calls at 80% return. But this dude just lost 20 grand he didn't even have. He needs to take a minute to chill and rethink his investing/gambling strategy.
What’s the potential of another squeeze happening though?

thought this since august and it took more patience than i thought
Because this is a new field and there will be more companies later on doing the exact same thing. It is in concept the same as a company that takes your regular gasoline driven car and turns it into one that can use diesel. There are thousands of companies that do that, from small to big. Additionally, EV vehicles now come with a better parts and labor support with the warranty. Why go with a change in a vehicle that has been on the road for 5 or 10 years when you can just get a new one in a 2023 when there are more offerings? 


Short term XL Fleet is good. Long term i'd gtfo. Lion electric aka NGA is a good EV company that will have a better run up when merged in February.
Will there be $300 a week back pay in the stimulus?
Wait, I know this one!  I’m actually fucking your wife right now!  It’s me your wife’s boyfriend!  Can YOU post YOUR current positions?  I wanna know what kinda beach house I’m going to retire in!

So on twitter it says he didn’t sign the bill and on here you mf’s say he has so what is it ???
Not bullish for wage slaves, but the market will rip more. Come time for feb stimmy talks it will rip more.

Just FYI, in an interview, Bill SPACman said he hopes to announce PSTH’s target by January. He also said the announcement is on schedule to be announced in Q1 of 2021. Ive been playing PSTH for a couple months now. I jumped in a little early and started averaging down. Last week I started going green on all my positions. I think now is a great time to hop in.
2000 is next on the to-do list
This market is going to shoobity town after open tomorrow, so don't forget to scoogle down your doogles. If it goes zippity before 10am your best bet is a broken wing butterfly box spread on SPY with short expiry. For those of you holding BABA calls you can expect them to go skrrrrt bigly. As for PLTR... 🥨🥨🥨💯

If you disagree with these predictions, fine, more money for me retards. I get it right every weekend but go ahead and inverse me I'm sure this is the one time I'll get it wrong 🤙
Lol sure you were buddy.

I agree, and am hoping that we are right. Ant Group is far larger than just Baba. IMO China would be stupid to break up Baba since foreign dollars (us) would get out quickly... investors in US aren't even able to buy Ant because of wait time restrictions
I just blocked the other daily thread
Depends on your bank roll but I would go further out and closer to ATM. This shit will pop with any positive Ant news but who the fuck knows when that will be. Xi is sweating Ma hard but ultimately this will fly. This is how I am justifying staying in the trade and not taking in L to offset some gains for the year. And Confirmation bias

Guys i was long feye from around $8 and i sold all at 20. It was a long term play and company has moat only in the email sandboxing space. A moat that is not even considered being attacked by Microsoft exchange or anyone else as its not a huge breadwinner. Nevertheless a good recurring earner for a small cap company that is trying new things and acquisitions etc. I was expecting it to slowly grow with aome reasonable catalysts by way of them acquiring someone or being acquired. However, this pump is ridiculous and has no fundamental basis whatsoever. Even their red team tools that were stolen did  ot have any zero day. Fortinet and Qualys are really good buys still and i have them from roughly 30% ago. I will look to even add to them once cybersecurity euphoria calms down a bit.

Tldr: feye pure spec play at your own risk. Stock  ot worth this price atm. Buy around 15 for LT if you get it.

FTNT and QLYS buy at dips.

He signed it.
They have this idea about sending people catalogs, it’s sure to catch Amazon off guard
He signed the bill with $600 payments
Cinnamon buns
Same was said in 2000 when online trading went mainstream.  Problem is if everyone keeps buying in at the tops with leverage and we get a couple weeks down or big correction again, a lot of people are gonna get wrecked.  

Look at ZM, its down to $375 and will most likely keep dropping, there’s probably people holding from the $500s who think it will go back and it never does.  Finally they cut losses when it goes below $150, this could happen with a lot of other inflated assets from this year.

TBH I don't care what it does, only that it makes money, I made a lot of money off PLTR, heaps of people here did, but honestly I hate what they do as a business, they are a shady company that trawls through your data, I'd rather they didn't exist ... but while they do exist and while an opportunity exists to make money, I want to make some of that money.

You could go all in some stock you like, with high IV. 

For me it would be U (Unity - most popular game engine, used for almost all AR/VR apps which are only gonna keep booming, pre profit) 

Buy 6000 shares for 985k and sell 2 month out OTM covered calls with strike of 250 (current stock price is 164) for 25k total, or go for strike of 200 which will net you 64k in two months. 

If you get assigned, well you made 64k + 210k or 25,8k + 510k.

Repeat every two months on any high IV stock you believe in and dont mind bagholding if things go south.

I said it as a joke but I'm actually debating between mid March/end of March and between 450C and 420C. Current uptrend channel arrives there ~ mid march lol top trendline is ~450 and middle of channel trendline is 420ish and it's what SPY is hugging right now lol.

Edit: ~500 bucks worth.
Lol...
Wait did he really sign 

Holy shit

I thought about shorting TSLA and when you think about the risk vs reward it's just not worth it.

Even if the market turns a bit bearish it could just maintain SP for 20 years until revenue catches up.

Totally get that. That’s probably a reasonable view, but we all know markets aren’t reasonable.  


A lot of people are forecasting an increasing rate of growth.  And you’re looking at just a vehicle sales. Many people are looking at insurance expansion, autonomous driving revenue (maybe), solar panel expansion, income from the super charging stations, and a bunch of other possibilities.  I’m not saying they are right, I’m just saying many people are looking outside the vehicle sales.  And as you said, who knows what else they may come up with in the next ten years.  10 years ago, no one thought they would be entertaining going into semi trucks and insurance.   


Plus their margins are better than other companies, so they deserve a higher valuation per revenue in comparison. 


While your view is rational & fiscally conservative, there is an (optimistic) view that can make a reasonable case. Especially if you think they will be expanding just as much in ten years as they are now.

The good thing about stocktwits is there are people that are hardcore into certain stocks there, and they are relentless.

As cliche as it sounds, you just have to do it. Set yourself up for success. Ideally place your self in a position where you can’t get any cigarettes, like a camping trip or something. After 3-4 days it’s much easier. Only hard part after that is fighting some insanely strong cravings. The first three days are killer, but the rest is just not letting yourself get complacent and make excuses like “just when I’m drunk”

did this guy just compare TESLA to AOL??!?
It was easy to see GME's price movement was still trending upwards when everyone here thought it died. I saw it hit its low of $12.55, .5 deviations below trending average. Bought 1000 shares. And sold at $19 recently. 
And yes, their gain porn is fantastic, because they held through what was obviously not crisis if you looked at GME's price over time while everyone else was abandoning ship.

Edit: Apparently sirjackalots did abandon ship around $15 or something. Right when it was hitting its trending average...so sad.
That’s not good for you
Yeah except he was a fraud to promote the sub

At a 40 strike your already deep otm, you need a large increase in underlying just to break even. Use an options profit calculator.  I bought when we had back to back 10-20% days and thought the melt up would continue despite a short report. Its upto you whether you can stomach the loss, unless you see PLTR hitting 40+ In the next couple weeks. But you could get lucky who knows

Optimistically? It WILL reverse this week at some point, probably tomorrow if it starts to drop and there's a sell off. If there is, it could easily hit $15. If it resists $17.05, then there's a 32% chance it will trend back upwards before another pullback, 32% chance it keeps dropping to $15. 
Any territory above $17.05, and you're doing some risky buying. 
Based on long-term pops and pullbacks, GME likes to bounce off 1st deviation, drop back down to it's trending average or a bit lower, then pop to 1st deviation again. It is currently ABOVE its first deviation, so unless there's an ungodly amount of fomoing going on to artificially inflate the price beyond where it is now, or some insanely positive news article comes out soon, I'd buy in around $16.50-$17 if it shows resistance there.

What exactly does this BABA buy back mean? They increased the ability to buy back from 6 to 10 billion, but are they actually going to do it soon?
Taxes don't matter until you cash out.
What would be the benefit of starting the LLC for trading vs. your self?

Just imagine going back to 2016 and picking up a shitload of shopify for $20 a share
You want 207 shares to get 23 warrants, might as well get the extra 7 shares for the extra warrant if you plan on holding, which you should do unless the target is Inspire brands or something

That is why you just change your withholdings assuming your job is your “primary” source of income. Make a profit and increase my withholdings to pay it back over the remaining paychecks and then fill out the IRS exemption for not doing estimated tax payments.

This is what people think but the real end game for stocks is either

- the company makes profits and issues dividends to investors that pays back the share price or

- the company is acquired by another company, presumably because there is an expectation that they will provide a profit worth the purchase price.

AMZN was part of the dotcom bubble in '99. After that crash, it took *20 years* for AMZN (which was one of the best dotcom companies) price to return to pre-crash levels. Most of the dotcoms never got back to '99 prices.

T stocks and sell month dated covered calls and puts to maximize trendies. ATT has potential to moon if it can trade at tech multiples. If it can show substantial subscriber parallel to the amount of searches it is currently receiving in the months of November and December - then we could see the undervalued telecom stonk trading at tech meme levels. Of course that’s a gamble and trade at tism levels since it can mean nothing. Big possibility of posting profits the combined size of Disney and Netflix could keep it boomer levels of growth.

I can see my learning. I had like 8K 1/4 of it Tesla. At one point I was up 50% in my first year. When Tesla kept dropping I didn’t sell. I had to start over -30%. From then on I trend upwards. Recently I’m spiking. Without deposit I turned 17K to 25K. No Tesla booster.
iPhone has been invented and you are talking about betting on Motorola and Nokia.

Sure, not a perfect metaphor as apple was not an upstart when iPhone was invented. But there are a lot of parallels.

For one, you underestimate how hard it is to make electric cars. First model s was launched in 2012, its been 8 years and even now, there aren’t half decent equivalents from European car companies that can compete with the model s. Ever wondered why?


The meat behind electric cars is electronics, software and AI like self driving technology. Tesla was born in the part of the world that is the best at all of this. Europe is decades behind on AI, Machine learning compared to Silicon Valley, VW has no hopes of catching up to google/tesla with self driving tech. Silicon Valley is bloody good with electronics, Europe is not close. China is pretty close to Silicon Valley and that’s why you see nio, xpeng etc get the hype. 

Next VW is coming from China. Tesla is the Ford/GM of the 60s from the US. Europe is falling behind because all the core technologies required to make great electric cars are not their strengths.
Oh I get it, homophones

Medical costs are bullshit though and we need drastic reform in the healthcare sector.

They are a car company, a battery company, a fuel company (super charger network), and a solar company.

They also happen to be the closest to fully autonomous vehicles that people can own (sure Google has self driving but Waymo still feels a ways off to mass adoption).

Are they overvalued? Maybe. The company has a lot of potential and much of their competition is only now coming around to investing heavily in EV.

happy cake day
The disagreement about the origins and the purpose of the Civil War remain to this day. The prevailing view is the war was about the abolition of slavery, which is supported by the documentation of the era. However there is a popular view that the war was about States’ Rights, and that the war really happened to break the South’s position or economic and political dominance. The legacy of the Reconstruction period and the Jim Crow south has formed the popular view in the GOP today.

I don't have a problem with a PE of 50 or even 100 if the business case makes sense in the *intermediate* future. The world of 10 years from now will look different from the world of today in ways we can't predict.

I *do* have a problem with PE 1000-2000, especially when the PE goes *up* with earnings growth, rather than earnings catching up to valuation. Toyota sold 11M cars per year, Tesla 370k, something like 0.3% market share. If Tesla matched Toyota's unit sales (which would take 9-ish years at current rate of unit growth) - which I think is possible but unlikely - we're *still* looking at a valuation today representing about 3x revenue for what would be a mature company then.

It's not that I don't like the company, I just don't know where all this TAM could possibly come from to justify the risk.
good point. this is my 7th year. the best advice i think ive ever received is from my econ teacher a few years ago. she told me to stay humble (i was up  about 700% at the time), because u never really know if you've been getting lucky or if you're good.

I started in early 2015 with a Tradeking account, 4 grand and a dream, but quickly realized that the $5 trading fees made it impossible to profit with such low capital while 'trading.'  So I did the wise thing and purchase shares in Chesapeake Energy in that account for the long term, since you know, oil was down.  That was pretty much my only research into it and obviously that turned out to be a terrible decision.  I just sold that initial investment for about 3 dollars (99.9% loss) to offset gains this year.  

Fast forward to early 2016 when I discover Robinhood.  It was great, I could really try to trade without the stupid fees.  I had my ups and downs over the next year, but generally underperformed the market.  This was before options were so popular with the retail crowd.  I became frustrated and bought some ETFs and looked away. 

The next chapter is 2017... I can't talk about the investment on WSB, but I bought something that begins with a C and turned 2K into 80K.  I sold half of that, paid my taxes and transferred about 20K to Robinhood. 

Stock trading after that went the same, ups and downs for the next few years, couldn't get my account to positive because I'm not a good trader and I discovered options.  That is, until coronavirus.  In March I turned my 16K account into 52K by shorting the cruise lines and SPY with OTM puts. 

Now I'm up to 98K because of not being a gay bear, being cautious with options, and holding onto to those other investments I can't talk about, as well as buying more.  

I did pull some cash out along the way for a house and car.  otherwise I'd have quite a bit more.
Do all stocks go up after a buyback? Could BABA be an exception?

My theory is basically that it’s a perfect storm because 1) millennials are coming into their peak earning years in the next 10 or so years and have enough career runway ahead to take meaningful risks and they are the largest working demographic now. It’s like what happened in the 80s-90s bull market with baby boomers  2) technology democratising investing / speculation 3) accommodative monetary and fiscal policy 4) recovery from the COVID recession and pent up demand. I actually think the alignment of these four factors is pretty miraculous so I really think this bull market rally is a once in a lifetime type event.

I love money. That's why I won't buy GME when it's trending almost 1.3-5 deviations above it's long-term trending average. I'll buy it when it hits close to its average or lower. Do you hate money? Throw your money at it Monday and pray it doesn't reverse on you, which there is a 70%ish chance it will because of it's current price point relative to long-term trending average. Have fun bro!
Whoa, they even have an exit strategy!  🚀

Jesus People be careful with GME! It's going to keep trending upwards but it is VERY overbought right now. If you want to make a profit don't throw all your money at it Monday, let it cool down first. It's trading at +1.5 standard deviations...+70% chance it will reverse short term soon before trending upwards again.

It’s a terrifying one to short too.  I did it the other day when it went down, with just 50 shares as a test.  Got out with a few hundred bucks profit, but it wasn’t enjoyable at all.  Definitely could lose an ass ton of money with how that stock moves.

I believe they will break up Ant and not BABA since it poses a much greater risk and is  associated with insurance and asset management. 

BABA meanwhile just has e-com, pictures division, youku, delivery and cloud. Rest all is invested across hundreds of companies in South east asia.

What a weird fucking company description in that article

> The company aims to build the future infrastructure of commerce. It envisions that its customers will meet, work and live at Alibaba, and that it will be a good company that lasts for 102 years.
If you didn't have a day job and realized gains in relation to not having a day job maybe you would too.

Correct me if I am wrong. Do you trade for a living?
To hit another double it would have to add the current market caps of google, facebook and walmart to it's own. Do you really believe that's likely to happen anytime soon? Future growth is very much already priced in.

You don’t have to go to college to learn anything. 

You’re paying for prolonged access to professors. Plus whatever tools they use (sciences have microscopes for instance. Scale as necessary). That’s it. That’s what the bill is for. And the diploma obv. 

If you want access to finance professors’ attention pay up. 

TL;DR No. but you will want a fundamental understanding of some math relationships. This isn’t a traditional skill - You can just get lucky, a heart surgeon prob not. You can do everything right and lose. An engineer prob not. Get educated and act w urgency about it.

Xi only wanted to teach Ma a lesson not to go against the government. Ma only owns like 5% of Alibaba.
I'm gonna invest in this primarily because the IV is low although someone like you who is likely a lifelong follower of commodities like soy should really invest in some of those high quality expensive data analytics memberships.  The ones that have cameras and shit all over ports across the globe.  Their membership is something like 5-12k annually.  

If you think investing in one stock is difficult, try investing in a crop that's grown to a similar scale of corn.  Need constant DD on weather, droughts, climate history.  Idk, I'm buying though.
I have a $1500 contract of baba , $225 call expiring on 02/19 , Lord knows I need a. Win.

Which Madden are you playing?
This Jack Bogle book called "Mutual Funds" talks about index funds as if they are mutual funds. I'm not arguing that every fund where people pool money to invest is a mutual fund, and was surprised to read that. I don't think of Berkshire as a mutual fund.

Also surprised that I've been learning about this stuff for two years and a quick google search tells me Berkshire is not an index fund. How embarrassing. Berkshire is a holding company. Buffett tells people to invest in index funds. That's where I got confused. 

Vanguard is a mutual fund that invests in Berkshire. Could be a reason Buffett loves Vanguard but lambastes mutual funds in general.

hmm
I would short but it goes against my morals, i do however hope you lose every penny you’ve got for investing in that shithole

I'm aiming for consistency. I'm on week 6 and on schedule so far, so hopefully I can inspire some people.

Nice. Yeah i skipped the weedstocks hype and thought the REIT was a good play. Made a bunch off 190c’s too just recently. Was flat for a while around $140-150 then just exploded december. They have a good bit of money raised and given that the new administration want to federalise weed, this could go really well, especially since they increased the dividends!

You talking to me?
Basically you only get fucked if the merger doesn’t happen. Warrants are worthless if that happens. You can buy shares with warrants shares without warrants or warrants only. If you feel good about the management and upward mobility warrants only are the way to go.

democrats will cave and sign a continuing resolution with unanimous consent from house and senate and sending it to trump. he will sign that to stall more and ask for 2k checks that will never come. this is all the trade war hype for a new deal the way he is selling more information to come.
MVIS over 9 was amazing but the following dip was not.
I did some math and I'm going all in 12/31 23c and 1/15 25c at market open tomorrow because these have the highest chance of profit to price ratio. Ideally you want to get in as soon as possible before the short squeeze commences. If calls are too risky for you go into shares as these will actually help the process along for everyone else and don't expire.

But it's different with Trevor.  He's taller and way more handsome.  Jon has a self deprecating "funny looking little dude" vibe that worked so well with his humor.

Trevor shines with whipcrack smart commentary and one liners every now and then.

Eagles need to rebuild big time. Other than Miles Sanders and maybe Hurts, I don’t see any other player on this team they could or should realistically build around/hold.  Get rid of Pedersen, Hurts starts next year, trade Wentz to free up cap space and maybe get some picks, and then see what they have to work with when playcalling is somewhat competent before moving forward.

I hope y’all got to the end. This is some big knowledge a lot of new (and old) traders need to here. No, 30% year over year is not normal. No, 1,000% swings in memes is not normal.

Yeah sure, but companies can't double in value every single year and as the largest company in terms of market cap in the world with an already gigantic global market penetration its infeasible to me to believe it's going to grow larger at a rapid pace. Amazon still isn't available all over the world; it can continue growing rapidly for decades to come. I imagine the only continent where it's hard to find an iphone is antartica, and i don't imagine penguins have much need for taking pointless photos of their asses or pictures of their freshly caught fish.

What is $XL?

 Literally 33 years old, just got married 2 weeks ago and today splitting up, jobless cause I was being threatened at work, panicked and fled the state to family. Family is toxic, so now fleeing to go live in my car. Literally went to apply for a small warehouse position, that I was informed would hire me last night while networking. 

Today, while eating a cheap ass breakfast struck up a conversation with my waiter. Not mentioning my plan to apply for a warehouse position, this server tells me how covid has affected the restaurant industry and he makes no money, but it's better than the warehouse job he had. They worked him like a slave, and that the warehouse environment was so toxic he had to call the cops on his coworkers for threatening to kill him and his friend from work. He would never in his life work there again (he's an immigrant from a developing country that has suffered worse situations and still wouldn't take that job). I don't know if it was a blessing or a curse cause now I'm not going to apply there. 

I have about $300 loose cash on my robinhood and looking to know what $XL is ao I can yolo my pathetic life earnings into some hope for another day.
Cheers. And I’m (and genuine investors, not the mindless masses) interested in hearing real bear theses. I think those of us that literally spent three days a week the last several months for 3-5 hours each time (thank you for being Roaring Kitty, u/DeepFuckingValue) examining every facet of the GME situation have bludgeoned it to death.

More about how fast we hit 450, not whether or not we'll hit it. If it takes a few months, I don't see an issue. But if it hits in a few weeks, I don't know, that'd be insane.

Yeah that's why I think I'm going to just stick to weed, at least that won't be a detriment to my health. Just need to limit myself to only smoking during the evenings and night like I do with alcohol. Been on a month long break from weed just bc I felt like I needed it but it just transitioned to me drinking, when before I wasn't drinking when I was smoking
Already in for 225c in feb, bought around 213 on the dip. Confident here either way. If it dips lower I am allocating more capital into legit leaps.

Forgive me if I sound stupid, but it almost seems pointless to break up Google at this point. Sure, they’d be “cracking down” but what would stop them from having behind-the-scenes control of each broken part? If they can have a secret backroom agreement with FB to defend each other in antitrust/monopoly suits, what’s stopping them from retaining behind-the-scenes control of the fractured parts? If you ask me, without really diving in, it seems as if the US government willingly nerfed their own ability to actually regulate this kind of shit because $$$$.
I'll look too.  I recall seeing something about this at one point but don't recall the specifics.

find stock like you have been... BUT...  sell puts, get assigned.. buy a put behind it if you want to hedge yourself against the downside - then sell calls to gamblers and chew on some theta.   No reason to just outright buy stock when you can reduce your cost basis significantly by selling puts and then selling a call once you're assigned if it happens.  you have enough money to do dynamic collars and milk premium.  -  congrats on your success BTW

Yes I’d have to find 400k to trade them in for shares
Again, I'm not a tax expert but you shouldn't have to pay taxes on a net loss for the year. Not sure if there's a way to write off those losses against future years or other/regular income for the current year but I'd look into that if I were you.

I know there's a strategy called tax loss harvesting as well but that may not be exactly applicable in your case with options. https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp

Jim Cramer is known to be THE most hung guy on Wallstreet, possibly one of the biggest in the world. His cock has been described as "like an evian bottle", with gargantual thickness that would rival shane diesel and shorty mac. Im estimating his size to be at least 8.5" bone pressed, with OVER 7" of girth. he would have absolutely destroyed any wife's pussy. They need spent hours and hours on foreplay, gettin get her wet enough just so she can take it. i can just imagine them begging for it, with Cramer  barely able to force it past the knob, while moaning and squirming, demanding Cramer  to force it in deeper. She would have orgasm'd within seconds of taking the entire length, being filled and stretched right up to her cervix.. the orgasm would have been powerful, with her vaginal muscles clamping down on Cramersq throbbing monstrosity, her whole body quivering in euphoria. Jim Cramer could cuck literally any man's wife without exception
Probably going to wait and see how SQ and AAPL are doing tomorrow morning. Whatever dips a bit I’ll buy a spread on 40ish days out. 225/230C for SQ or 130/132C if it’s Apple

And then at some point I’ll try that spy itm weekly spread people in this thread mentioned. But with less cash, just to play around with and try out

Its hard to find on youtube but its on bitchute . really good insight , especially in particular to this subject and how jews ( ashkenazi) came to essentialy be in control of almost every sector and industry of the world and power structure.  it has nothing to do with hate or contempt, it is just becoming more educated on the history of society and why it works the way it does

Yes, like voat or 4chan....

For the record, not slandering 4chan. It has its place in this world.
Its hedging on multiple levels. If the vax doesn't work they blame a new strain. No, no you got the new strain not the one you got vaxed for and then as I said before it allows them to set up a yearly oreven 6 month vax schedule. Do you know how pharma works? They never cure anything. The board rooms right now are all talking how to milk covid dry. It cracks me up that wsb of all places hasn't put together the money motive behind covid news. I guess its the rest of reddit leaking in. Il predict right now covid vax will be pushed for a minimum 5 years with a "new strain" every year with different efficacy. It will ultimately end up a flu/covid combo for 30 years.

Thinking more a negative interest type deal
OP here.

WRONG.

Once the warrants go live for you, PS can issue what is called a redemption notice. Basically the stock has to be trading above $36 for 20/30 trading days for them to be able to do it. Once that happens you have to pull the trigger within 30 days or they take the warrants from you for a penny each. But its not a risk. You just exercise them at that point. So you get 2 shares for $23 and the stock is trading at a minimum of $36 (you get the $13 difference, per share).

Nonsense anyways, it'll be at $100 so you get the difference of $77 per share. LOL.

So your bearish portfolio offsets the bullish in a bull market and vice versa in a bear market? Seems like a losing strategy
Shrek, Hulk, or Green?
The only time bulls really get in trouble is when retards buy at the very top of a massive run (SEE FUBO, QS). Either buy in the early stages of mooning or wait for the short correction and hop in. Otherwise you better hope your option has enough time to ride out the waves
Society is a bull. We, the human race, are "going up". Bears live in caves, not unlike "cavemen", who are not "going up"

Yessir. I appreciate your personal insight. I have been building a TLT position slowly, long dated calls and short dated puts. I am slightly apprehensive that TLT could retract sharply as it does from time to time. Just read up on what moves TLT and supply and demand moves indeed moves it. I think my confusion was in not differentiating the secondary market from owning bonds directly.

Agreed. They sent the message that they have optionality.

Jumping on BABA?

Also what you guys think of BLNK and SQ calls at open?
I mean I’d make that trade. 

A million can insure my kids have the best schooling and have their basics met, for life. 

Alternatively, I can probably make 60-100k if I bust my ass working around the clock, but don’t see them for a year.

So really it’s 900k (less taxes) to trade away a year of my life, eating shitty food, sleeping on a shitty mattress, with access to shitty healthcare. 

Don’t do the time, if you can’t cash the dime.

Yeah. Ultimately you have to pull the trigger how you see fit.

With PSTH, if you use your head a bit and some common sense, its hard to lose if you are in below that $30 floor.

We are on the launchpad though, make no mistake. LOI incoming.

Don’t miss the GOEV rocket. 🛶🛶🛶
This, if you lose everything even 10 years from now on, you still lost, but then, if the world ended by then, what's even the point of money.
My moves tomorrow: wake up, have my coffee/joint/cigarette while I scroll through the daily thread and check premarket. Shower, get dressed, and double check my checklist - not stocks though, not tomorrow. I'll be checking to make sure I have masks/wallet/passport/luggage/phone chargers/shit like that. Smoke another joint on the way to the airport. Check my suitcase. Check premarket again. Eat a  bit size piece of shroom chocolates. Get Starbucks. Head back outside for one last smoke and eat another piece of shroom chocolate. Watch market open. If ARKG dips, maybe buy another 12/17/21 call. 110 or 120, depends how I feel. Go through TSA and head to my gate. Board the plane. Check my account one last time and then open up my iPad. Watch the Pixar movie Soul. Probably watch one more movie or something then I'll land in Cancun. Upon landing, I'll call my wife and coordinate getting picked up from the airport. Once she arrives, I turn my phone off and spend the week between Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum. Have a happy new year. Come back after a week and wonder why I didn't just stay there.

Well look for opportunities to yolo but don’t FOMO. There is always another play. Remember that or you become the bag holder
Interesting thx. Double your money on a standard purchase.
Just send me my 600 already. I'm ready to yolo
Perfectly understandable and I completely agree.

My thought process is that options for the Psth Dec 2021 at $23 strike is about $9/share, and as far as I can tell the warrants, based on Thursday's data, are also around $9. It seems somewhat interchangeable but the warrants could offer a longer time til expiration (or it could not and it has to be sold within 30 days).
In a bull run like this all news is good news.
P.S. it's green lol

Stimulus talks going well
Exactly
Its true. If you read the "criteria" section of the S1, SpaceX is an outlier. Stripe/Bloomberg/Fidelity/InNout fit it perfectly though.

From the S1:

**Our Acquisition Criteria**

Consistent with our core investment principles and business strategy, we expect to identify high-quality companies that have a number of the characteristics enumerated below. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to complete our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet all of these criteria. We will seek to acquire companies that have the following characteristics:

**Simple, predictable, and free-cash-flow-generative.** We will generally seek companies with a proven track record of growth and free cash flow generation, and predictable future financial performance that we expect will generate strong, sustainable growth in cash flows over the long term—however, we are open to considering a company that may, at the time of the initial business combination, be cash-flow negative, if we believe that the business’s cash flow will become positive within a reasonable amount of time;

**Formidable barriers to entry.** We will seek companies that have long-term sustainable competitive advantages, significant barriers to entry, or “wide moats,” around their business, and low risks of disruption due to competition, innovation or new entrants;

**Limited exposure to extrinsic factors that we cannot control**. We will seek companies that are not materially affected by macroeconomic factors, commodity prices, regulatory risks, interest rate volatility and/or cyclical risk;

**Strong balance sheet**. We will seek companies that are conservatively financed relative to their free-cash-flow generation, after taking into consideration the de-leveraging effects of the initial business combination;

**Minimal capital markets dependency**. We will seek companies that can benefit from being a public company with broader access to the capital markets and greater governance, but will prefer companies that are not highly reliant on the capital markets to operate and grow their businesses;

**Large capitalization**. We will seek companies with large enterprise values and significant long-term growth potential that will be likely candidates for inclusion in the S&P 500 index;

**Attractive valuation**. We will seek companies at an attractive valuation relative to their long-term intrinsic value; and

**Exceptional management and governance**. We will seek companies that have trustworthy, talented, experienced, and highly competent management teams. These companies may be led by entrepreneurs who are looking for a partner with our expertise to execute on the next stage of their growth. For target companies that require new management, we will leverage PSCM’s experience in identifying and recruiting new management.
They’re designed that way but they don’t have to work that way

Any dairy farmers in here? Why is milk getting more expensive? I don’t want to be overpaying for my cow juice
Yes, that's sort of the story, IIRC. 

I believe there is a non-linear relationship between the price of steel and MT's margins. In bad times, MT loses money, but in good times it's a money machine. MT is universally hated by just about everyone, though. 

So, you can see that as a reason to buy options on the cheap (or at least when this was first posted a month ago, or so), but the commodity "story" has been going on for longer than that.
Alright 500 shares on Monday. Or do I go insane and sell other stocks for this?

If Dems snag both runoff seats in Georgia most stonks (blue chip, tech, etc) are going down, but MJ, clean energy, and recovery stonks such as airlines are going up. Reason: Increased corporate taxes, larger relief bill, Blue Wave from full Dem control.

If Reps retain at least one seat (~70%+ chance this will happen) there will be more jet fuel for the bull rally and it will be safe to remain bullish on SPY/tech.

I think EV and clean energy in general is the safest investment right now. Whatever happens, EV will be going up. It's both tech and trades up with the overall market but it's also clean energy and can become a safe haven sector if there's a Blue Wave.

J&J should report results from their vaccine study in the next couple of weeks.  Should help increase supply of vaccine if the study results are positive.  Pfizer and Moderna will also report on their initial results of testing their vaccines against the virus variants that are emerging.  Market will react poorly if either of them report a significant decrease in efficacy against a new variant (unlikely but possible).

The warrants are technically 5 year expiry, yes. However, PS can exercise a redemption call at any point once your warrants go live. So the 5 year thing is up to them.

That said, they have to give you 30 days notice.

The safest play here is commons and call options.

You can play with warrants, just be careful.

That is very risky. What happens if gme issues shares to raise more cash, enabling the shorts to cover easily for instance.

Furthermore, should eps tank for some reason then shorts will only be vindicated..

Waiting for a shorts margin call is high risk for sure.

I hope it works out for everyone.

Very envious you got in on the units. I was so busy in the summer I missed it.

I watched Ackman pronounce that "HELL IS COMING" live on CNBC in March in my kitchen. I love his plays. Sad I didn't get the units but I am not missing out on the actual launch day.
For each SPAC he brings in a specialist onto the board of directors. He mentioned the individuals for each of IPOD, IPOE and IPOF.

It should give a clue to which ones he talking about. I’ll come back and add the details when I look up the interview

EDIT: 

Alright lads here are the details.

IPOD: The additional team member for IPOD is Nirav Tolia. The former CEO and co-founder of NextDoor helped the company raise $250 million at a $1.5-billion valuation.

Tolia also worked at Benchmark and Shopping.com. Tolia was the CEO and co-founder of Epinions and one of the early employees of Yahoo.

This fourth SPAC from Palihapitiya raised $400 million, which was an increase from its originally announced $350 million.

IPOE: Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp V: The extra team member on this SPAC is Jay Parikh, the former head of engineering at Facebook (NASDAQ: FB).

Parikh held that position for six years and also held the role of VP of infrastructure at the company for several years.

Parikh also worked for Ning Inc and Akami Technologies (NASDAQ: AKAM). He serves on the board of directors for Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ: TEAM).

This SPAC raised $700 million, up from a previous planned offering of $650 million. 

IPOF: Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp VI: The sixth SPAC from Palihapitiya raised $1 billion.

The extra team member on this SPAC is Richard Costolo, the former CEO of Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR). Costolo led Twitter from 2010 to 2015. He was also the founder of FeedBurner, which was acquired by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) unit Google in 2007.

Doesn’t really give a clue on direction but all high performers. IPOF giving me the tendie tingles

Good news on the Covid Relief Bill.
You could have said this about $QS 2 weeks ago when it was up 100% and around 30. It went on to hit 135. I don’t think you understand what OP is trying to tell you. The market is not acting rationally and that is how you can make 300% on a stock.
Just be careful, I had a lot of success with weeklies and 0 DTEs until I didn’t and erased all the gains I made and more. Set those stop losses
close out all your Amzn positions

Calls all day those stupid gay bears always loose haha
I once or twice dabbled In the alternative gay bear lifestyle, though enough green hulk dicks taught me a gaping wide lesson and were a good conversion therapy. Long calls and spacs now and up Bigley for the year!
Since Nikkei is green, that means HK will be green as both are Asian markets and so look and act alike and so BABA will be up
It's easy to play options when we're in the greatest bull market of all time

Man I am up so much since I started doing this shit. I also have the benefit of it not mattering to me personally. I am financially secure for life regardless of investing.

I truly posted this specific post for others. Do I benefit if PSTH gets pumped? Yes. Does it materially change my position once this pops? No. Not at all, lol. Peanuts.

I was just flabbergasted by how little people understood the BIGGEST SPAC TO COME TO MARKET.
Thanks
Tsla valuation almost makes sense in that scenario
Guess who was building a position in regeneron two weeks ago?

First wsb post and I’m considering long calls on ICLN
It's not like Vaccine being effective on the 2nd strain was announced 30 min before opening and Trump tweeting " Good news on Covid Relief Bill. Information to follow! " 30 min after opening. Oh wait it did happen lul

Just started about 1.5 weeks ago. The tablet with a full glass of water. Seems to help, was having a lot pain and ripping my asshole wiping 1000x
Imagine thinking Trump's only goal before he is out of office isn't to pump the market. He wants this shit to 35k so when he runs in 2024 and the dow is 30k he has the easiest campaign message in history.
You need to pump those numbers up
If you got weeklies / monthlies plz sell Monday we’re about to get get fucked till January. Roll them out 3 months minimum

If I finally come out positive and someone irl figures out that I made some money, it was because I robbed a fucking Bank. Not by investing in "code plug".

I am cringing so hard right now.
No one is taking it lightly. He lost 60k. I said he can earn that back 10 times over since he's 20. Even if he makes 30k a year, in 20 years he'll have earned that 10 times over. You're making an argument over something that is likely and reasonable.
'kinell still stalling on relief payment, us gov is tighter than me minge
I have lost so much with options 🙈
Microsoft is too big to move that fast. Look at its charts...slowly but surely grinds upwards. Losing play imo. Also don’t listen to me cause Idk what I’m talking about. Good luck.
Nikkei is green LMAO
Yes

While bears are getting fucked overnight, be sure to check out my DD guys. Roast my shit

Donald Pump!

ASTRAZENECA CEO: COVID VACCINE EFFECTIVE AGAINST NEW STRAIN

Good news on Covid Relief Bill. Information to follow!

Just go with the flow
Whew, this time it looks like Donnie Pump over Donnie Dump
Bull portfolios be flying like a kite
tell her about that GME squeeze, that could pay off the mortgage by next week. then youll be stress free by next week.
Isn't it safer (lord forgive me) to just buy the warrants? It's basically a single share 5 year call with strike at $23?

The literature behind warrants are still a bit hazy to me, but as far as I can tell, the warrants can be held for up to their expiration date, which is quite a bit away.
can i convert it to FDs?
What are we gonna say when Donald pump is gone? Joe BUYden?
to avoid pump and dump bullshit
VACCINE WORKS AGAINST NEW STRAIN.  COVID FUCKED https://twitter.com/firstsquawk/status/1343324399370309633?s=21
Yeah options on CRSP are probably not a great play just because of how hot it has run. NVTA going to bounce back fast
Probably not

Ur bullshit ass puts
I've had fairly consistent success with calendar spreads the past month, on $HYLN before the drop, $WORK after the purchase, and $BB up to and after earnings. Usually looking for atm or close either direction 1 week apart, for $0.06-0.10 entry per spread, about 28-35 DTE. Buy as many as I can and watch for  favorable exit at 10-50% profit. Trying my luck on $AAL, but not super happy with my current positions (1/22-1/29 $17, $18 calls)
before i dump all my money into GME will someone just tell me if i should be using ameritrade lmao
Already have.
The whale bought at 16. You clearly didn't read the DD that is available

Anyone know why mango blames China for blocking the 2000 stimmy payments?
Before the market wasn’t saturated with a ton of retards so theta game barely existed, earning pumps would 9 out 10 times stick, just a few examples now you have everyone playing every side.
where are you getting that number? 300M dollars worth of shares or 300M shares?
Why does mango man constantly tweet as if he has some world altering video of Biden sucking dick on a pile of fake ballots or something?

July is along way away
Thing with AMZN is they always had high revenue growth, just shit profits to show for it. You could tell that if the margins improved even slightly, the company could be a money maker. Some of the companies today, especially TSLA, are seeing flat revenue growth and shrinking margins from competition yet still seeing stocks up 300-500%.
Hahahahaha.
And btw I'm from Europe so I couldn't even trade on Thursday and Friday. I would have sold on Thursday if I could have

At this point, it'd be better to just tell people to just put money into the market and do the whole stimulus talks going well cycle for the next year or however long it takes for the whole covid thing to pass and everything opens back up.
Soooorry to be that guy but I really didn’t like your point 6. explaining options simply because if you never address implied volatility why even trying teaching options. Too much of a flex because you gotta your play right but options fundamentals are lacking.
Yes

I’m not arguing the dictator rules with an iron fist. That’s why I called it a dictatorship. And I was just in Beijing this year, I am well aware that internet services are filtered. I couldn’t even use Google maps. But the government does not determine the price a barber can charge or a plumber, and it does not control the commanding heights of the economy in the same way the Soviet Union does. There are plenty of market forces making decisions, but with a babysitter ruling over them. Look at my post history and you’ll see multiple posts of me saying it’s not a good idea to invest in BABA right now, because you don’t go to war against the dictator and win.
CB by open :( sorry bull
Gold n Silver looking nice

No.  You let the Dilberts, bean counters, HR, and lawyers do all the legal and compliance work.  It’s no difference from Elon’s perspective and current situation.  He recently hired 25 guns, experts, where tech support goes for tech support.

I was mostly kidding about currency not having value- but by your standards it’s worthless to have intrinsically, so I will offer to take all of yours lol 


And yes, the company will never sell the assists because, you don’t sell the cow that makes the milk.  I would rather have a way to make $1/year than to have a $1 this year.  It’s the ability to make money that is valuable.
Yeah, the dividend is also crazy.

Make your money, pay your taxes which blows my mind people complain about, and move on and try to do better than the people before you. Sorry for getting so deep outta nowhere but your message hit a note.

Really curious to see what CRWD opens up at. The news of hackers failing to breach them in the midst of all these other companies experiencing major breaches may send it up big time. Of course they are probably still on a short list for some big contracts. Something to keep an eye on this week.

Sorry I am referring to the likelihood of receiving more than 2 warrants through the tontine structure. That happens only if someone chooses to redeem their shares not wanting to go through the merger. The odds of that happening seems pretty low. I understand how the warrants get exercised above 23. Still a question - it says PSTH ‘can’ exercise a redemption forcing you to cash out. Do spacs always force warrant exercise above a set price point?

Maybe a smart move, good luck brother. My baba calls are 3 weeks old so I'm down like 90%
Could’ve actually held it through the pump earlier this year and made out pretty well
It’s easy to manipulate garbage stocks when people here have 10s of thousands of dollars they don’t care about. This sub is a giant pump and dump that forces YouTube personalities to cover it, which trickles into minor financial markets... until it hits mainstream. Then people like Cramer gotta try to explain why his audience should invest in trucks you have to push downhill even though they’re making people hundreds of thousands of dollars.

You certainly make a good point about the possibility of voting to start paying dividends. In that case, those shares would indeed have intric value.  The other part of the intrinsic value would indeed be the assets owned by the company, like in your apple example. In practice though, I'm not sure how tangible that would be, as the company would be unlikely to sell assets and use that money to pay dividends.  

About cash, I'm absolutely familiar with the fact that it's not backed by gold, hence why it's a reserve of value which requires make-believe, unlike say golden coins, which at minimum are worth its gold content (although even that value is also relative, golden being also a reserve of value, besides being a commodity).

PSTH can exercise a redemption clause after your warrants go live. They need to give you 30 days notice. If you don't sell the warrant or exercise it at $23, they take it for a single penny.

Don't be that person who doesn't check your mailbox or the internet or your email once the LOI happens. On LOI day, your ass is on notice. They can only exercise the redemption clause if the stock is at >36 for 20/30 days and you better believe this monster goes to 50 or 60 on LOI.

According to a
report by the Federal Communications Commission

However, the speeds that DSL customers actually received from CenturyLink services regularly fell short of the advertised speeds. While this seems like disappointing results, it is not unusual for internet providers that use DSL technology.

Currently they are green, so they matter
I wrap my entire body in tinfoil to create a Faraday cage
No that's not right.  The two are one in the same.  Your view doesn't even make sense, because you can't get around the fact that there is a dictatorial role of government in Communism to control society.   There's always a rejection of civil rights and an authoritarian control of people in these type of societies.  And land ownership isn't what you claim.

Village collectives own farmland, not individuals.  State owns urban land.  Communist.    Jinping rules with an iron fist.  If you don't believe that go mock him publically and see what happens to you.  Carry a large sign mentioning Tiananmen Square on June 5, 1989 too.  The state filters the internet services there so you can't even search for things critical to the CCP.

It's called communist because it was and currently is a communist governing nationstate.

Actually, MSFT was crap because Ballmer was a finite leader unlike Gates. However, I think MSFT has had great growth under Satya but I don’t like their culture or like working with them so I wouldn’t put any of my personal money in them :)

What’s your best guess for a PT for GME come end of feb 2021?
So all the big boy banks are forecasting massive gains for 2021. Some forecasts say 420+ SPY, bond shorts are at ATH leveraged to the tits for equities, is there any way we don’t continue this rally for another year?
wtf is  ADNPX then?

Chances of redemption are next to nil making tontine a moot point? Read somewhere redemption means cashing out at original nav of 20. Why would anyone do it? Seems unlikely to get more than 2 warrants per 9 shares

Just a friendly reminder that about 16,000,000 people lost enhanced federal unemployment assistance yesterday. Amounts vary by state but that's about 5-10 billion in consumer dollars dissapearing - or 1/4 to 1/2 a trillion anuallized consumer spending leaving the economy.

Will it matter this week? Probably not. Just nobody say there were no glaring warning signals. 🌈🐻. Gonna mostly sit on the sidelines this week except for lottos here and there.
Facts bro GameFly was the shit if your parents refuse to buy you $60 games
I held it for a bit but it just never moved. Best I saw was 11$ recently but dropped back to 9$. Made a small amount of money on it but nothing to write home about. Maybe for a long term hold. But for quick gains. There are better places for your money.

Wouldn’t the maximum amount of shares they could give out already been established? Do you know how many they could still give out? So maybe there is some room, but if they want to give out an extraordinary amount of shares that decision should go through a shareholders meeting.

You buy the commons on RH. When this goes postal RH has a mech to give you the warrants. Just contact them. Its been posted on here elsewhere. Stay safe, and rich.
Don't do options, and don't invest any money you can't afford to lose. Think about it going to $0 and make sure you're ok with it. Then, as the other guy said, pick a few companies or funds you like and invest. Buy things you'll be happy to hold long term, so even if they go down at first, you're confident they're good if you wait. This goes along with the "be patient" thing that the first guy said.
No one is pumping anything, unless you think he’s trying to pump a $1.6T company. Zoox is owned by Amazon.

How about selling the 35 Jan 2023 calls for round $7 in which you'd get $280k. It would limit your upside to round $900k with GME at $35 and roughly $1.15 million with GME at $45, etc but your downside is locking in $280k.

Sir, most of us are here to lose money. 

 If you should win some, it is always better to have it firewalled inside an ira, 401K or Roth IRA.  On the first two, you pay taxes only when you withdraw funds, hence the appeal. However, you can not deduct trading losses from your taxes on money you have lost trading in your IRA or 401K.  You need to check Roth somewhat as there are requirements on 5 year holding, age restrictions etc, that you want to research through the IRS website.

Apple has said they want to get into the electric vehicle industry so who even knows at this point
Poor article meanders in subject and doesn't address the substance of the bill, but I found a summary of the bill on Congress.gov

"The initiative must invest in artificial intelligence research and development and support the development of an artificial intelligence science and technology workforce pipeline, among other activities.

The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) shall establish or designate

a National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee to advise the OSTP on matters related to the initiative;

a National Artificial Intelligence Coordination Office to provide technical and administrative support to the advisory committee and serve as the point of contact on federal artificial intelligence activities; and

an Interagency Committee on Artificial Intelligence to coordinate the artificial intelligence and technology research and education activities and programs of the federal agencies, among other activities."

Their p/e is very deceiving. They lost a full quarters worth of production out of their main factory due to covid shut downs. And they also have deffered revenue they can't claim yet. If they could claim that deffered revenue their p/e would be in the 300s. Still high, but also low considering they are building 3 factories and growing 50% YOY. It's a very polarizing stock because there are multiple ways to look at it.

Bud. I’m ambitious, not a “broke ass loser,” which is a pretty Internet-loser thing to say. I’m just viewing reality how it really is, that young people own a smaller proportion of the total pie than young people owned 50 years ago. Things have changed for the worse in terms of the difficulty of building wealth. Doesn’t mean you can’t still do it, but it also doesn’t mean you should take losing huge sums of money lightly.

He said they are on track to close within six months. Original goal was 6 months in July and he reiterated that in September someone said. So anywhere from January to March is in that window.
If ARKK could open at 135 and PLTR at 30 we’ll shieet I’d be happy man

It’s crazy how if you read chat, you expect a circuit breaker. In reality, we down like 0.01% in futures. Y’all are so over dramatic.
Well I think: apple chose varta for the airpods because they compress power to a small size. Now apple wants to build cars .... think about it ... what will happen ...  tesla is in germany, too.

With the no alternative investments, it only bursts when other better alternative investments come available.  So, as long as you pay attention to alternatives, you won’t be hurt - the scale would be years of transition, not overnight, so it’s not going to “pop” for those reasons.  But it will be inflated for those reasons.  


I disagree with the non-dividend portion part.  You own a share of a business, which is a way to make money.  If all the shares voted, they could turn it into a dividend share.  That’s the value.  You own a way to make money.  You have a say in what to do with that money.  


If you have a problem with non-dividend shares not having value, wait til you find out about paper money not being back by gold & silver! 


It’s like saying that owning a savings account full of money has no value unless you think someone will pay more for it.  Not the case.  These business own assets, have bank accounts and you (by owning a share) are entitled to a portion of it.  

Look at Apple pre-dividend days- at the end of 2012 & beginning of 2013, they literally had more money in the bank & assets per share than their share price.  They could have been bought out for the current share price & the each share would have profited.
Yes very healthy

1) The stock was massively depressed by negative sentiment/short sellers. Its hard assets alone were worth waaaaaaaay more than it's price at it's lowest. It's easy to make the argument now that it's still under-priced and is on significant sale. 

2) Recent strategy pressure from Ryan Cohen, successful Chewy-dude, is pressuring the board to a more modern, cost effective and efficient strat.

3) It's shorted to the tits.

For anyone who’s wondering, this is a part of the defense bill that should pass without any major changes
Oh no baba$

Holders/ traitors   Ya about to see more pain Monday
best buy has an almost 27 billion evaluation. gamestop's valuation is currently 1.4 billion. if gamestop even reaches best buy in evaluation, it would make the share price roughly equal to $395. not to mention, best buy has never really been in a bad position as badly as gamestop. there's more potential for gamestop to grow because of this, and because of the market cap. its easier to move lower market cap stocks because of how supply and demand works. if all of a sudden 1 billion $ was to flow into gamestop, it would almost double the price, while 1 billion inflow into best buy would only move it about 4-5%.

TLDR: market cap of best buy is bigger and not as effected. also, most of their revenue probably doesn't come specifically from console releases. I imagine most of their revenue comes from appliances, if I had to guess.
I know people who work at ATT. The entire management chain is incompetent and/or doesn't give a fuck.
Yes. Because thats $2400 for a family of 4. And it will get pumped back into the economy to keep it moving. 

It’s the whole backbone of QE & QT. As the only way to prevent or get out of a recession is by spending. Once people stop spending. That’s when we’re all fucked.

Quantitative Easing and spending is the way. And then once this shit show is over the fed will begin to reign it in slowly with QT.
Surprisingly something that should have been done to fix things that caused the financial collapse in the US, but since it’s gyna doing this que the guy with butterfly is this communism meme

Core One Labs (CSE:COOL), (OTC:CLABF), (Frankfurt:LD62), (WKN:A14XHT) just bought Vocan, a firm who specializes in producing synthetic psycobilin (the good stuff in magic mushrooms) for research purposes, as that is highly promising in treating depression, anxiety disorders and the such. They still have a super low market cap in comparison to others, and the bigger players in the area (e.g. Mind Medicine) have made several hundred % gains this year, so there is high potential, especially as orher companies mainly research the benefits of the ingredient, not its synthetic production per se. So that will be my main move for tomorrow

Do people really take out a personal loan at 10% APR or whatever and then throw it into options like this?

I honestly can't imagine the thought process. Even if you go up 10% in stocks you're up 0% because of the loan interest.
Yep, investor meeting on the 29 and Kevin Harrington and dr drew will be in on the meeting discussing 2billion ppe loan
Realistically, if history is any indicator, they’ll just change the formulas used for calculating inflation to whatever can give them the metric that they want. There’s a lot of awkward elephants in the room when it comes to the inflation/deflation discussion.

Technically, you can't know users like deepfuckingvalue and this guy aren't lying. Perhaps their genius plays are just part of hedges of market makers (that would even convince mods) and they are here just to lure in retail idiots that also want to strike it rich. 

I am not saying that I think that's the case. I am just saying that people will murder for money, so lying is certainly on the table.

The market makers could just manage a bunch of fake accounts that do big bets (in a paper trading account (!)).

When Volkswagen squeezed hard in 2008 it briefly became the most valuable company in the world for a short period of time.  So today I think Apple holds that spot at $2.4T market cap.  \*IF\* gamestop did the same thing as volkswagen did in 2008 that would place the peak past $3,200.

CRSR and NIO hitting ATH this week. Get ready.
It’s bullish long-term, because the market won’t crash until put/call ratio  is extremely low. But could be worrisome for this next week, particularly Thursday
I own shares. Not that I buy all the hype, but I have been around long enough to know this will run up big next earnings at a minimum and there is almost no risk holding shares till then
Reduce risk. The farther ITM a call OR put is, the lower the risk of it relatively speaking. Far ITM calls simulate a long share position, while far ITM puts simulate a short share position. Calls or puts OTM really were never meant to be used in the way they currently are. Options in general were actually meant as a hedge, and OTM options are supposed to be used as an unlikely hedge...That's why they cost so little.

You could take $50,000 of what you've made now and probably be able to easily get $5000 a month if you're selling options and running the wheel on high IV stocks.

Because they're getting out of the disk drive games business as their main business. 

Want to buy a game? They'll have it ready right there in their omnichannel. Their multi year partnership with microsoft is proof of that.

You aren't into Consoles but need a new graphics card? Same day delivery or order and pick up at the store is what they're going for. 

Local tournaments will never be the same over the internet. There's a reason sports streaming services are massive but so are the locations they take place in. Check out what happened to the SSBM community this year. They have planned online tournaments because they cannot take place locally because of the virus. But the demand is huge. Gamestop could become the community hub for gaming! 
Local tournaments are just a theory. A GAME THEORIWILLSTOPNOW. But there are also some facts.

Did you notice that gamestop employees are usually avid gamers, too? That's not cause gamers want to work at gamestop, that's because gamestop wants gamers to work at gamestop! If you want to trashtalk a game, an e-sports player or manifacturer they'll probably happily discuss with you. 

They aren't planning to rebrand, it's in full motion. Check out their linkedin page! "Gamestop is the cultural hub to unite the worlds of gaming" - their new mission statement. They're listing as "Technology" and not as "Retail" anymore. They have started to offer PC parts both in stores and advertise it on their facebook page. Oh and if you didn't get the newest graphics card or console because some douchebag scalper snagged a few thousands online, watch them try and fail to do so when attempting to do the same with gamestop. Even with same day delivery that'll still be restricted to that stores allowed stock and area so scalping does not scale at all. 

As for why buy stuff online at gamestop over any other retailer? Well why do you buy most of your stuff at amazon?
Probably because it's pretty much all in one place, it's convenient, prices are often better than competing retailers and all of these will be true for gamestop with everything regarding gaming.
I bought a ton of GME last week and plan on more at open. What are some good covered call positions to sell against? I’m thinking anything expiring in less than 3 weeks. Anyone doing weekly covered calls ?
Yeah but, how?

There are so many wonderful comparisons like this.  If DIS was valued at the same P/E ratio as NFLX.  If INTC was valued at the same p/e ratio as NVDA/AMD.  These comparison's actually have some actual utility to understanding market share and whether something is over/undervalued.  Folks justify the valuations of companies like TSLA/NVDA/NFLX because they're going to grow, but the reality is that they are already priced as if they have already grown to what they 'could' become.

Shares are the wise option here (high IV means you can always sell covered calls on a portion if you want), otherwise April calls are sensible, Jan are a bit more risky.

At this point I need to buy MGM calls with margin, you could literally have a disclaimer before every game saying it is rigged and people would still bet on it
If you wanted to buy all the shares in a company at the current price it would cost a lot. If you divide that cost by the amount of money a company makes in a year you get the P/E ratio
If you take Teslas growth from the past 10 years and use it to extrapolate the future growth for the next ten years, the valuation is correct. Bulletproof reasoning.

In fact i've called up some NBA teams and told them that if they extrapolate the 300% growth this 8 year old kid i know did into the future, they're going to have a 3 Meter giant soon enough so they better sign him on right now for a top player salary.

No, yours is bullshit. First, you don't get to tell people what to do with their savings. Second, people are more or less forced to allocate their capital to some class of asset other than cash given the massive and long-term depreciation of fiat currencies over time, and almost all asset classes get dummied during a broad market contraction. Anybody who hopes for this to happen is a prick.

It remains true that people who hope for big pullbacks so they can enter into positions they slept on are selfish and lazy cynics who need to git gud and do their DD before the run up rather than after.

You poor victim you. You're mad because you got a 1/4 piece of a larger pie instead of half of a small pie. You might be right that younger people own a smaller percentage of wealth than their parents but a smaller percentage of a larger number is still a larger number. You can't just examine one facet of the economy and say "oh well we're fucked". It's a broke ass loser attitude. The possibility of attaining enough wealth is reasonable. You just might not be able to afford a 3000 square footer in the burbs because you missed the housing boom.

> Question if u make that much and leave it in the market... no cash withdrawals... do u still have to pay taxes on it?

Doesn't matter. Once your sell order fills, you owe taxes on the gains. Even if you immediately buy the same options or stock again 30 seconds later. Money in your brokerage account is not left in the market, it is simply "cash" in your brokerage account. 

> Does it depend if u have it inside your roth ira or 401k?

Gains in retirement accounts are not taxed like this.
Dunno why you guys give the Chinese government your money. They lure you in with sketchy companies that pump off cooked books.

Forget GRUB, the free money is in DASH puts/shorts.

DASH is worth way less than $50B or 19x Sales. They bought Caviar last year for 2x sales. GRUB trades at 4x sales. Grub is fairly valued.

Only 10% of DASH shares were offered to the open market. The other 90% paid an average $8.73 per share. Let it soak into your smooth brain for a few moments.

Once the other 90% of shares are out of lockup in 90 or 180 days this fucker is gunna tank.

Fuck around and make bad trades u already know how it is baby
This post resonates with me. I’ve been trying to get rich quick, but in practice been making more losses than gains. I see that you baghold if you have to. I always get frightened at the first dip and then sell for 5-6% loss. I need to find good/researched stocks, take a position, and then hold for that 25% gain - even if it takes a longer then I would like. Patience is key, but always easier said then done. Thanks for the advice!

Depends how much oil is needed though. The Saudis have a lifting cost of like $3 a barrel. The average costs of US produced oil is $12. If not that much oil is needed, a lot of US capacity is going to die out because you can't compete with the Saudis. Big oil might survive in the form of state owned enterprises but the big oil corporate might be dead.

That said, big gas ain't going anywhere soon and most big oil is also big gas.

It's like fucking clockwork every week 15 minutes before futures open the bear downvoters come out in force
Buy baba at $175
The amount of bearish comments in here can mean only one thing: inverse WSB
if that means limit down, yes
drinking coffee & listening to wsbsynth. It's what Mondays are made for
If BABA drops another $40 on Monday, are we buying more calls again?
Futures
8$ leap?

Lol I think Ark can handle that.
Apple has the opportunity to undercut EVERYONE in EV in price, because majority of their profits will continue to come from large margins of phones and computers. They can put as much money into this and not worry about larger margins. Tesla has to, because that’s all they do.

True. I just think of this as a trading tuition. I have to pay about 1k a month lol...
I got blocked for explaining it last time so dont report me.

Pop culture in America consist of rap, cars, guns, drugs, sex, money etc you understand what I mean.

Pop culture in Japan consist of cute, small, cartoons, anime, manga, cinema etc.(kawaii)

some people just enjoy their culture more and it seems weird to us because it doesn’t fit our narrative. Delphine is considered “normal” in Japan and if you or me went to Japan we would be looked at as weird westerners.
I feel like I did the smart thing by buying the BABA dip but in this market only retards win so I’m definitely fuk tomorrow
Premarket/futures
But actually though
I use the Kelly equation and dont use more than 10% of my bank roll per week in expiring calls.

Thank you man.I wouldn’t know GME if I didn’t check your post. I feel next week is gonna be interesting.
Not my problem to figure out but this position has the shorts so entangled that I don’t even know if they know how they’re getting out

Making cars will complete different ball game for Apple. They need to partner or buy a company like Ford/GM to avoid the headache of manufacturing cars, so that they can focus on Batteries and software. GM already have their battery tech (Hummer EV). 

Also, Apple is rumored to release the car around 2024. That is almost 3-3.5 years from now. That is a lot of time for Tesla to fight off any serious competition. Their $25k car would be amazing as well. Tesla weak points are the interior and the cybertruck.

On the other hand Apple, have their unique way of doing things. So let's see how it goes.

If the SPAC boom that we’ve been enjoying this year continues for 2021, I will have at least $1M by the end of next year. All in warrants under $2 for companies that you see potential in, and you literally can’t lose. And that’s why I think they will be going away some time in the near future, but until then... 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Right..
No way you didn't screen your first 3M
Of course nobody knows, but if drops after seasonal earnings then it'll probably have had it's year high already.
Okay.. yeah this is racist - fucking retard

Brilliant. I'm going to copycat you.
Nio may be my next move.
I totally agree with your reasoning and there's no doubt the current situation is fueled by this lack of alternative investments. 

 The problem is, just like those good old tulips (there was no other investment that could rival it at the time), there's the risk that at some point, the bubble bursts.
 
If we go back to the most basic level, there's no reason to invest in non-dividend paying shares, as one would simply be buying a piece of paper with zero return. The only reason people still buy those shares is because they believe someone will pay more for it in the future (it constitutes a reserve of value). If we look at the other booming investment right now (fitboin) it is also a reserve of value.  And reserves of value require make-believe. If for any reason investors lose faith in the reserve of value, it becames instantly worthless (unlike dividend paying shares). So, to sum it up, its dangerous territory.
Yeah, spend 1 year studying and paper trading before you put any $ into the market. There will ALWAYS be opportunities.

Seriously, fucking do this.

I started at work. I’m a network and systems engineer at a IT company more or less. We were talking about AMD and how they’re taking over the market. I thought about buying AMD stock, and I did, at $70 dollars on robinhood. I then ran into this subreddit and wanted to know more about the lingo and insane gains porn. Naturally I learned about PLTR. Which worked great when I bought stock in at 17 dollars. Then I found out about options. PLTR options burned the fuck out of me, and it’s been down hill ever sense.

Since then, I’ve learned to diversify my portfolio, and not yolo my account in options.

For a moment, I was obsessed with reading this sub reddit, and thinking about my next move. I would then take my current investments and move them to what I thought was the next big thing. If I would have held onto my investments, I would be doing a lot better. I’ve learned that the only thing I can control about my investments is time.

Currently I have stock in rebound companies like Spirit, Carnival, and Norwegian. But most of my money’s been in Apple lately. It feels safe, and I have faith for them to grow.

It’s a learning process, but I think I’m getting the hang of this through tough mistakes lol.
Coulda swore that was the To Catch a Predator hotline
Your dumb
Those are real stocks, not meme stocks. Get yourself some GME and PLTR. 

Personally I think XOM is in trouble mid term. I read somewhere it was suggested they issue bonds so they can cover their 9% dividend because there was talk of slashing it. So I expect them to do so, but if energy doesn't turn around by Q3 the dividend may be in the crosshairs again and big money may start pulling out. I also wouldn't have a dime in GM.
And for a fraction of the price!  I heard the new mid engine corvettes are pretty nice too.
Yup GME has been great to a lot of us and it is just the beginning, all in baby. Going to roll out my 1/22/21 $13 to July yolo's because I am already up so much on them and April 21 calls.
Sorry, I must have misunderstood. Ya I agree with you!
This is the way.

Just 2021 confirmed. I’m guessing summer, but both BYND and MCD have stated they see the McPlant as a collection rather than just a veggie burger, so my guess is they roll out a full veggie menu. They already have the chicken down at KFC, and pork released in China. So I think MCD will announce a burger, chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets, and a pork burger all at once. Should be the catalyst to push above 200. I’m going with 140 1/21/22.

Big Oil is still going to be around in the long run, right? I mean even if the EV revolution actualizes, the batteries would need to be powered by some energy source. Solar power maybe? But the solar panels are made of items which come out of hydrocarbon. So in that sense, Big Oil will survive? Though might have significantly less influence?

It's a game, dude. And it's a 0 sum game when trading options- every dollar lost by you is a dollar gained by somebody else. My 500% gains means a bunch of losses for somebody else.

Asked if he got a deal on his lease since those units have been vacant for at least a year. 

Said they knocked it down 20% if he signed for 3 years. 

Wished him luck!

He should have walked out on that “deal”.

I made a shitton on Tesla, but decided to move over to Gamestop in the last few weeks as Tesla melted up over $600/share. I still think Tesla will go over $800 sometime in 2021 and Elon will become the richest man in the world, but, I think Gamestop will 10x or more when the short squeeze starts. Ryan Cohen also reminds me a lot of young Elon Musk (I've been following both of them since 2010). 

Good luck, I think you made one of the absolute best choices in the market going all in on Tesla.

It’s a criteria to be met. So after December 15th Snow needs to trade above 130% ipo for 10 out of 15 trading days which makes the shares eligible for selling. If so, the shares unlock 15 trading days after Dec 15th.

1) I know nothing about CFD so I’ll leave that to you or others reading.

2) Extremely important point and excellent question, well played. That’s all bullshit nonsense imo. Retail investors thus far haven’t moved this stock that much. I think the news of an acquisition is going to dwarf anything pertaining to wsb/twitter-related movement. The thing to keep in mind is that Ackman is hunting. He is going to literally gouge the eyes out of whatever whale he lands because he’s engineered a situation where that works for both sides. He’s not skimming off the top like other SPACs do at the front end. But he’s taking the target for a ride on the back end, rest assured of that. Why you ask, new investor? Because he’s obtaining a minority stake. It’s basic psychology 101. The target company is being presented with an actual assurance of 7B in cash on day 1. No IPO bullshit like we saw with ABNB and SNOW where they each lost 4B in valuation on day one. That assurance is worth something itself, and it translates to a bigger piece of the pie at an “attractive” (word Ackman keeps using) price.

Ultimately, it shows how big his cerebral cortex is. Even Buffet’s Capos didn’t think to do this. My guess is that Ackman, with this move, and this structure, is going to actually re-define what going public means. It truly is biblical. In the months and years to come, this will be more fully realized and everyone will copy him. But you have the dubious honour of having stumbled across the play. Good for you. And good luck.
CSS is turing complete. Maybe. If you exploit it or something.

This is running on the assumption that ev are even actually better for the climate. Those batteries are incredibly inefficient to make, will die and need replacing over time, and the fuel for most electric vehicles still ends up being fossil fuels anyway. The combustion just happens outside of the car, and then the energy gets used to charge its battery. 

We need some way to store clean energy in a compact package that's better than lithium. Bc lithium sucks

Prob gunna buy more bft.....paysafely my friends
I think more the point is the short squeeze. We know RC is long 12.4%, WSB is long somewhere around 10% and the shorts are over 100% of float. Just from the numbers if we all hold long enough the shorts will have to cover and where are the shares going to come from? This isn't a value play, intrinsic on a negative EPS doesn't equate. The catalyst is short position margin calls.
Niiice. Well I'm no expert but I'd personally take a milly out, have a nice short vay-cay, then get back at 'er with the 500k left in the trading account. Good luck, brother!

What’s up guys.  Just wanted to give that one person confirmation basis -  my entire portfolio is in NIO 1/15 with approx 10% in VIX calls.  I’m diamond handing them till the end.  Feast or famine bitches.
There’s always going to be risks involved anyway. If I lose my job and can’t pay mortgage, the bank will happily reposses my home. If I missed paying the property tax, the city will gladly auction my house even if it is free and clear. Risk management is important, in any endeavor. This all happened between 2009-2011. I thought my neighbor was crazy to buy multiple houses at that time. But he was buying them at big discounts because of the housing crisis. Almost 50% below the cost to build one, so he’s got good after rehab value. Ex. He paid $40k (he took money from his 401k) for a foreclosed property, rehab spent about another $30k (credit cards), rent out and refi for $190k. Took 75% or $142k cash out. Rinse repeat bought two properties with that cash. He was bummed to be maxed out on 10 property loan limit. Meanwhile, I’m just watching on the sidelines, not understanding the value of leverage and working hard to pay off everything. While his money works hard for him, I work hard for money.
You act like I’m rich

Buying online through GameStop because you own GameStop stock is the way
What are the news?
Without going too far down the rabbit hole, as it's evident that I prefer to go with "long form" info, I am not a fan of real estate as an investment. The time/cost in keeping it up over a long timeline as well as the necessity for leverage (debt) to buy it (typically) makes it unappealing to me.  I currently own a small commercial property that I needed for work some years ago and I am literally counting the days until  the current tenant's lease is up so I can sell it and repurpose the funds.  

Probably not the answer you wanted but 1) I'm not a financial expert (as evidenced by all the hate I'm getting from some here LOL), and 2) I'm so biased against real estate as an investment that I feel my thoughts should be taken with a major grain of salt.
RMG as you said. I’m currently up over 1200% on some of my calls. Turned 9k into $120k on one strike.

Ok there pop chop. Just because it’s a boom doesn’t explain why younger people back then had a higher percentage if the wealth than young people do now. If anything, the fact that it was a boom should’ve hurt younger peoples percentage of wealth back then (but it didn’t, i.e. you strengthened my point), since older people would’ve been able to take advantage of it with their savings. We’re not taking about the size of the pie, but how the pie is divided up among age groups. But hey if ignoring the obvious makes you sleep easier at night, you do you.

As an added bonus, they have a customer facing app for reviews, dispensary locations and even delivery.

I saw this as well, curious when he’ll announce what it is
OP, at your service.

Based on all known interpretations of the S1 (all we have to go on since the fucking press isn’t reporting on this) the downside is limited to $20 per share. So taking the stock at $26 as it sits now, your max loss if you bought at $26, would be 30% of whatever you put in. Lots of caveats there though. First, it won’t happen, this deal is gunna happen in Q1. Secondly, you can sell before at anytime like any other stock. If in 19 months (with one month to go) there is no deal, the stock isn’t gunna be at $20. You could sell them at like, let’s call it $21.50 and decrease that max loss to 25% or whatever.

Again, the second point is just for completeness. It’s not gunna happen. Deal is likely done already.

Also, your 55% upside is very, very conservative and very wrong. Based on size and other factors, this stock is going to provide 100% upside on LOI, at a minimum. Some people are floating a $250 price target post merger. 

Have fun and stay safe.
Add SQ to that list

Thank u bb
Doxxing yourself online, Melvin? Just asking for retards to send them taunts via snailmail after GME hits $420.69
Why PFE?
I went to grad school to learn how to be a quant. I knew next to nothing about mathematical finance going in but I did a little research just to beef up my application letter (because no school will look favorably on you for telling the truth, "I want this degree so I can get into a career that pays a lot of money"). The whole program is about pricing options, futures and other derivatives, plus a few courses/seminars that expose you to the kind of people/things you can expect on Wall Street.

I started the program in September 2018, and right around that time I heard PredictIt in the news. This was around the time of Kavanaugh's hearing, and since I thought his chances were good (market gave him a 48% chance right after Christine Ford testified) $20 on him. After Kav gave his own testimony it went to the high 70's and I walked out with $30. I also put $10 on Jair Bolsonaro becoming President of Brazil, which I honestly forget why. Probably read his Wikiquote page. But I held that to expiration and also made some money.

What really set me off was finding out that PI ran a weekly tweet market on Trump tweets (you have to predict, to the nearest 5-10, how many times he would tweet for the week). Figured out an arbitrage strategy ("negative risk") that due to the mechanics of the site would deposit cold hard cash into your account. Not a glitch, just taking advantage of market inefficiency. Ended up pocketing maybe $25 a week until I had enough of a bank to make directional bets. If you follow Donnie long enough you start to pick up on patterns and can usually make an educated guess on where the winning bracket will be. I even wrote a paper exploring some strategies as my master's thesis (one strategy survived the test of time; the rest fell apart pretty quickly a few months after I published the paper).

In the meantime I saw a PI reference on WSB and I was hooked. This was one of the first posts I remember seeing on this sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8s08ap/step_4_buy_stock_step_5_what_is_the_stock_market/. Slowly I went from being scared of investing my 1k in the middle of that late 2018 downturn to screwing around with two-figure options (OTM GE put iirc) to getting more and more ballsy. 

Fast forward to now and I have a six-figure sum across two portfolios - my buy and hold is full of 3x funds, still based around the strategy I posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ce7f4e/the_wsb_guide_to_index_funds_a_buy_and_hold/, and I dedicate 5-10% of my Robinhood funds on fucking around with options. Currently riding the PLTR/GME rockets. Made out like a bandit in March because I listened to Mister Metokur and he was full on panic mode about the coronavirus January/February. Rode puts all the way down and sold them once I realized the green days were a bit too green late March.

YTD up 45% on Robinhood and 51% on M1. Whenever I think that's a lot I look at the gain porn on here and realize that there are some places where even I'm a conservative investor. WSB made me a lot richer and the bantz on here made me a lot happier. Thanks frens

I just think if your money is going to be somewhere actually like the broker. Have my boomer funds with Vanguard because of their founder and switched from Fidelity to Schwab after finding out all of Wall Street wanted to cancel this guy because he just wanted lower fees when it came to purchasing and selling stocks. I still see predatory shit with Fidelity such as trying to sell people on a women’s fund without telling them it has a 2% expense ratio? They also buy up pre-ipo stocks for their family clan and then sell it to their customers within their respected funds at a higher entry point. Maybe I’m looking too deep into things. Lol

1.5% going to turn into -20% real fast. atleast it always does for me.
Well I think we're testing 3500 this week. About a 10% move. I could be very wrong and lose the 4.5k I paid for the options. But if its not moving like I think it will I'll be out sometime tomorrow for maybe a 2k loss. If we hit 3500 i could gain about 55k profit if I hold the whole time which could be very hard to do. If I can hit 20k profit I might sell. It all depends on how the charts and volume look

Ya but a lot of retail shareholders would be rightfully very annoyed with GME management, who could have just as easily diluted their shares at a later date when their stock price is higher as a result of the squeeze. They also dont have that much debt to cover and aren't desperate for cash so why would they do it except to piss off people or do a needless favour for Melvin? I believe RC's involvement limits this possibility from happening, but you're suggestion isnt crazy, but I hope unlikely

Obviously GME won’t become Amazon, but it could certainly provide an Amazon-like service for the gaming industry and become the go to place for gaming products.

I do portfolio management/commercial underwriting. It might be possible, but would be pretty hard to qualify like that on a sfr.

hey thanks. I understand the mechanics for the most part now. So suppose TLT (20 year) goes up 1% tomorrow. Intrinsically, what is driving the move? I want to say the answer is buyers and sellers predict rates will go down (?) or did the rate actually go down?
I don't think so. Trump will veto and the media will want at least want a week to bash him and the Republicans.

For inflation to happen you need money to be created, not by the fed, but from the real economy.

Money is created when people go to the bank and ask for a loan.

With this covid and unemployment there aren't any loans being issued so no money is being created.

So no inflation. Actually the opposite is happening, money is being destroyed since people are payimg of their loans and saving money because they fear unemployment.
I mean fair, but if you compare AMZN and BABA market caps it seems crazy that BABA is half price when Elizabeth Warren is champing at the bit to break up some mega-caps

Hi Team PSTH,

Big fan of PSTH - I wanted to run this idea with you guys and let me know what you think. My broker allows me to buy PSTH on margin (3 to 1) and this got me thinking. wouldn't the max downside be limited at 20$?  If I play 60K$ on margin (20K from for margin maintenance) - wouldn't the max that I can lose is 12K$ ? (20% of 60K)? but the upside could be at least 50%+ once the target acquisition is announced? What do you guys think of this play? Please only serious answers as I might be putting quite a lot of my personal savings into this?

Thanks!

What’s stock should I buy next week for long term gain
Just kidding, do your own DD and give yourself enough time for your play to unfold. The weeklies are tempting but they’ll be the death of you. Two weeks ago I dropped 36k into RAD weeklies if I had sold them at open I’d be at 100k and I didn’t but I still collected 45k then played NKE which again if I sold at open I’d be up to 66k and I didn’t and dropped down to 18k
Hoping PLTR finally does something and will probably buy more GME if it doesn't open at a metric fuckton

Yeah exactly. If you put all that money in a new position without withholding some to pay your previous year's taxes then you could be put in a position where you have to liquidate some of the new position at a loss to cover your tax bill the following April. 

Or, worst case, you could be left with no money to pay taxes that you still owe, though someone else mentioned the option to defer, which I'm not familiar with.

Start with $500

You buy 10 $18 Calls 12/31 at .50. 

End of the week, you sell that for 2.50.

You have $2500. 

You buy 50 $23 calls 1/8 at .50. 

End of next week, you sell that for 2.50.

You now have $12,500.

Repeat until squeeze, then move everything to shares and long calls and coast the rest of the way to the moon.

Do you understand how options even work? That only matters if he's holding remotely close to expiry. BABA goes up 20% relatively quickly and OP will make good money. I swear people here can't even fathom that someone would buy an option further out than a week and sell further out than a month. If BABA climbs it's an easy play to hold these calls like 3-4 months and then sell before they decay too badly.
It makes total, sense.  I’ve personally dealt with the same issue for the last two years.  It’s hard to change your historical perspective. I don’t think the paradigm is changing, it’s just being re-established by a huge shift.  It’s hard to explain in a short paragraph.  I’m not great at writing, and it’s just my opinion.  But, I used to feel the same way as you, and have come to see things differently.  Could be right, could be wrong, but here’s my attempt to explain how I view things now: 


So, Who said that a PE of 40-50 is irresponsible? The norm has been less than half of that.  However what really establishes a reasonable PE is the risk vs alternative risk.  


PE ratios really just tell us, how fast our money will double right? 


If we can get 5% interest rate on a safe treasury bond, our money will double in 14.4 years.  So any company with a PE above 14.4 would make little sense (unless there is massive growth projected and little risk).  


However, with interest rates being 0% - 1%, it will take 72 years to double our money.  In many countries, the interest rates are negative.  So now, any PE under 72 is reasonable.  If you project interest rates going up in the future, then yes, you’ll want a better PE ratio or will transition out of high PE shares eventually.  But any PE under 31 will put you 10 years ahead of having a 1% rate that increases to 2% in 4 years.  If that company has any reason for growth, you’ll do even better than the alternative. 


Basically, start asking yourself what the alternative break even time is right now to double your money.  If it’s something like a 50-70 year answer for bonds/treasury, then even a company that has a 300 PE but could grow sales by 8x in the next 3-5 years (dexcom), is arguably a better investment.

I’m always a move late so that means baba puts tomorrow when I should’ve purchased them Friday for day trade . Will get in on arkg again, didn’t want to hold over weekend. Hopefully fedex starts moving but no upcoming catalyst so we’ll see. I remember viewing BA at 160 in like October & not getting in so watching FDX closely
Life is hard, but i try to keep my hopes up for a better tomorrow. I wish you all succeed with your hopes and dreams.

The average American is about as financially literate as a wet bag of noodles. This is why Dave's advice works - it skips the trap of credit card debt altogether, which a lot of people need to hear. Especially since those tuning into his show are most likely those that shouldn't be tempted by credit cards. But for someone who even knows the slightest bit about money and budgeting and tracking your spending and not being an absolute dumbass, credit cards are free money. Not to mention... if it gets stolen or fraud happens, who cares? That's the bank's fault, not mine.

I used to listen to his show, and it definitely opened my eyes to my spending and saving habits. But some of it is just straight up garbage for those with half a clue about money. Chase alone has given me close to $1k in cash back this year, and I'm a pretty small spender. That's $1k more I got to lose in yolo diamond hand plays.
It's been hard getting through the last 3 1/2 days without losing any money.
I doubt that a card that is bought by 1 percent of consumer market is gonna impact the stock in a major way . But you do you

I'm laughing too with my GME shares as well. Laughing my way to the bank that is.
I think the word Stewart kept getting wrong is it's not Financial News, it's Financial Journalism. His misinterpretation of what investment is, I guess, is a reflection of what the common 401K investor understands, is that a 401k is a market based long term investment only, that isn't affected by the market.
Get some.
V S P R or G H I V. I know that’s two but both have DA’s and room to ramp up before merger which is during Q1 for both. Also less downside since both aren’t at a high premium over their NAV.

In so far as you *think* you own something, it could be destroyed in 2 seconds with the flick of a pen by the CCP and you would have no legal recourse for overturning the decision. 

This is in stark contrast to a free market, capitalist system, where a government can not just unilaterally take our property. Even legislation passed to do so would have to hold up to judicial and executive scrutiny, and would probably require constitutional amendments to do so, which is really, really hard to do - for good reason. Even eminent domain laws are very, very grey areas, and the person impacted must be financially compensated. 

So where would you rather invest your money? Go ahead and keep throwing money at a communist shit hole, I can’t stop you. Just don’t say you weren’t warned.

If only this activist investor would have made very clear that he's going to use any means to increase value for shareholders and if only Sherman would take this so serious as to prepare a poor man's poison pill.

why morning spike?
If I understand correctly, that would mean realizing the $1m gain by closing your position? 

It seems that when people are warning others about paying taxes on their gains, (which should be obvious) what they're really warning you about is putting all of the gains into a new position, without holding any money aside for capital gains tax. ~~If~~ *When* your new position goes south, you would no longer have the funds to pay the tax bill.
Market isn't open how else am I supposed to meme?
Who has all these fucking awards lol, giving them out like free candy
People who think this way honestly make me sick. When the market crashes ordinary people with small savings in their 401ks get slammed and end up having to delay retirement/homeownership etc. 

Hoping and praying for a market crash so you can buy in on some boomer index like SPY that you FUD'd on 6 months ago is a cope against your own personal failure to be able to identify future opportunities. 

Please reflect on this and be ahead of the curve on your DD in the future rather than selfishly hoping for the ruin of others.

If Dave said "some debt is OK" then his people would be rolling with $150k in credit card debt, title loan on the car, payday loan and $100k in mutual funds and then when they go broke they would howl *but Dave said debt was OK REEEEE!!!*
OK so you are probably talking about the yield for the 10 Year Treasury (guaranteed by Uncle Sam).  If so this Bond is the barometer for almost anything; mortgages, credit cards, car payments, corporate bonds etc).  The rate is established by the Fed and since it’s considered the safest investment all of the other listed instruments will have to apply a higher rate (risk / reward & profit spread). Also remember the relationship between the price and the yield of a bond works like a seesaw unless the price never changes which never happens.  
Ex;
Face Value: $100 per bond. 
Rate: 5% annual (currently under 1%) 
Time: 10 years.  
Every year for the next 10 years you should get $5 (plus interest) on the 10th last payment and your original $100.  

However if the price of the the bond goes down say to $90 then the yield would go up say 8%.  Inversely if the price of the bond goes up say to $110 then the yield will go down say to 3%.  

Pushing the rates upwards or downwards is one of the Fed’s most powerful tools depending on what they want to accomplish.  Good luck

Sell half of it please 💎✋
It’s a terrible broker with tons of better alternatives.
Can you elaborate more on the last part
Disclaimer: this is not financial advice, likely not even 100% correct, so trust but verify

If you realize the gain you will owe taxes on it, so if by leaving it in the market you mean you're holding the same shares but they increase in value, you don't pay any tax until you sell the shares. 

For example, if you buy 100 shares of Tesla for $500 and they go up to 1,000 but you don't sell, you owe no taxes. But, if you sell those 100 shares you owe taxes on the capital gain even if you never take the cash out of the trading account or immediately reinvest. Your brokerage should give you a statement early each year that gives you all the information you need to tell the IRS what gains you realized.

More info here on short vs long term capital gains: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)

To your other questions about Roth IRA and 401k, if you're trading inside those accounts then you will only pay taxes in accordance with how those accounts work. If you buy and sell shares in your Roth you are not taxed on them at all, if you buy and sell shares in your 401k you're only taxed on withdrawal.

u/FUPeiMe does a good job explaining this in his post: [Tax Info to Cuck Uncle Sam](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4phe2/tax_info_to_cuck_uncle_sam_so_simple_even_a_wsb/)

There is no such thing as a non-biased DD. Either you get your info from a dopamine-desensitized smooth-brained autist strapped to a rocketship, a journo who is paid to produce analysis using a company-approved model, or a short-seller sitting on a shipping container full of bleeding puts. You choose.

WSB is not your personal google, if you want answers, you find them. If your own research makes you bearish, that's fine, but post here after you do it not before.
I still don't understand how life insurance makes money. I can buy a 20 year term life policy at age 65 with a $250k payout for $1000/year. There's a 80% chance of that policy paying out according to actuarial tables.
Appreciation is accelerating as we haven't been building homes at a large enough rate for a decade and [as you said] borrowing costs are low and will remain there.  

Most people can access a fixed rate loan to avoid having payment increases though.  HELOCs not usually fixed but nearly every mortgage is.

If they do have a lot of unsecured debt, just do a cash out mortgage to pay for your sins at a low, tax deductible rate 😉
FINALLY A MONDAY THREAD THANK GOD
Fabulous!!!
In my opinion as well.
You can only invest in the stock market if you have a New Jersey Fishing License applied for prior to the grandfather cut-off of 1992, OR you can have sufficient North American opal to put up for equity. Shit is hella rare tho, so I bet you don't have the opal. If you do have the opal or the NJ angler setup, refer to other suggestions in this thread. Otherwise, you're gonna need to invest in raw materials, probably granite, and save some cash to contract the haul. Godspeed -- I hope many counter-tops realize by way of your venture.

That's where you miss the fucking point... In nowhere Kansas you would have not been able to sell your games otherwise. You would have gone to Walmart purchased your game and been stuck with it unless you had a friend who is willing to buy it from you. Stop trying to defend this narrative that somehow GameStop fucked anybody over you willingly sold your goods to them for the set price. If GameStop didn't exist you would have never been able to sell it for anything because you didn't have the tenacity to go out and find someone to buy it, because if you had you would have never taken it to GameStop to begin with...  GameStop offered a service and whether you used it or not was entirely up to you.
Yea think I will subscribe to the feeds. You use cash or margin? Heard it's 1 day for cash to settle for options and margin is minimum 2000 USD. So I think 2000 USD for margin and lower commission requirement per month is worth it in initial deposit.

Thank u bb
Yes B&M is dying but no one here is betting on GME surviving with an outdated model, they’re betting on GME turning it around into a modern platform and getting in while the price is low. $20 is still low should RC and GME succeed. 

Every video game will *not* be digital due to data caps and download speeds. 

Being so shorted adds the squeeze potential. GME has been circling the drain for years but *that is no longer the case*. Whoever is stuck in that mindset will lose out. 

If you really don’t know what changed with GME since Covid hit, you’ve clearly done no research. Ryan Cohen buying in this summer and applying pressure for a modern business model, and then GME following that model and RC buying *more* is a very bullish case for this company to pull out of its multi-year dive. 

The contract with MSFT is hopefully just the beginning. Sony and Nintendo may feel the pressure to make similar deals while GME wants to expand online. There will continue to be physical stores as distribution centers and if hard copies of games are on the decline, there’s plenty of room in the gaming industry to expand with other products. 

That’s all for now.

Mostly in SPACs now, got some big wins and stopped chasing lotto play for the most part. Combined with the 45% raise from leaving big 4 i’m condo shopping rn

That's true...so pretty much the highest interest loan first is actually better if you do it, but the kind of person who's taking out $30,000 high interest car loans they can't afford might be too wacked out to behave rationally...so I guess they might be more likely to take his worse advice than no advice at all?

But

\- pumped only because of RC with good timing days after very bad Q3 report released

\- New console cycle stock gains are over, clearly reflect previous PS3 PS4 , after console reveal - stock rises, after release - goes down

\- They sold hundreds of stores, immediately, this is not a migration to omni-channel digital model, this is fighting for life

Who would have predicted that in March America would announce we were abandoning capitalism and the market would be up over 70% in 9 months.
It’s because the kid is 17 so they can’t open an account under their own name. (Robinhood doesn’t have UTMAs that I’m aware of) so they probably opened it up using a parent’s name. Which is a no no and the taxes owed will show up under their parent’s name. Imagine you randomly have a $10k bill that you don’t even see the gain for. Trust me, I don’t let the tax tail control the dog
Good luck 💪

buy moar RMG maybe some IPV and CGRO.

I feel the urge to long call the fuck out of GRWG

I like the interface.  I like the fact that it’s a margin account even though I’ve got a sub $2000 balance on there. No waiting for settled funds, but have to watch PDT rules.
No I think I agree. I was considering getting leaps for January, or going with shares. I just have limited capital so I’m trying to allocate strategically. I think I have enough to go ~100 shares on either MT or PLTR and then buy calls for the other.
What OP did is functionally the same as gambling. He had a FAR, FAR higher chance of losing the entirety of $20,000 he bet on this trade then it actually paying off. Probably not a good idea if you’re already broke with three kids
Moving ~50% of my portfolio into GME
I’m buying Tesla and GameStop for sure... also shorting the market from February third with April put and then reversing and buying the furtherest OTM SPY contracts  with early December expiration as well as picking up IWM leaps in June.
Its not happening guy
Stock price divided by EPS (net income divided by number of outstanding shares). This of it this way if you’re a very profitable company (high EPS)then a low PE means you’re undervalued and vice versa.

Anyone asking “this must be the top right?!” needs to look at any index chart since the inception of the US stock market and realize how dumb of a question that is. Unless you are imminently planning to die and need to figure out estate planning, no, it’s not the top. And unless you feel like rolling the dice and almost assuredly losing, just bet on the upside.

He got a lot of people to give a shit about politics in that format, which was good. But like West Wing, his own angle has aged really fucking poorly like "The Rally To Restore Sanity." It's like the class rep standing up in the middle of a high school foodfight saying "Come on you guys, we're better than this"

Yeah I was talking about Ma Hua Teng. I think and truly think Jack Ma is part of the success of China over the last decade, I am in Guangdong for more than 27 years as I was born there and I can see the change.
Alibaba bring jobs and works to any area in China (especially remote area which are still the poorest), yes it is cheap ass stuff yes it brings bad reputation but this is a just transition but we needed this transition and we can see now China  is slowly transitioning, gaining better reputation and making high quality / premium products (Huawei , NIO, XIOMI, DJI etc.. you name it)
Don’t get me wrong as an half Chinese citizen I love China and I support China I just think there are some change to be done but still we are on the good way.

You got bigger issues than your phone clock if you don’t know if it’s AM or PM
You're operating on a faulty assumption of the premium price for a put that is already $10 in the money at the time of purchase.  If you bought 100 shares of GME at $10 and it went to $20, roughly where it's at now, your $1000 investment is now worth $2000.  If you bought a $30 put, it'd cost you about $1000 premium, a little more really, because it's already $10 in the money at $20/share.  If it went to $0 or close by expiration, yeah, you'd have the right to exercise at the strike $30, giving you a profit of $3000 - $1000 premium = $2000 total profit off the put. In a sense, you spent $1000 for the 100 shares, made $1000 on them, then paid $1000 premium for the $30 put, then sold the shares for $3000.  From start to finish, you'd be up $2000.  You'd be better off holding the 100 shares bought at $10 and gone to $20 ($1000 profit already) and then writing covered calls - it wouldn't be that long until you made $1000 off of them and then you could write one final call at a strike you know will assign and then just take your $2000 profit that way.  It's much more probable than GME going to $0.

Let me guess you held after 12/18 and got IV crushed?
Good news doesn’t sell news. The vaccine shit doesn’t mean anything for the economy for another 6 months. This shit is already priced in. The stock market had a lot of smart people managing funds in it. They know the realistic timeline for the actual economy to get back and track. My prediction is things happen one of two ways. 

A. The economy starts to recover as the vaccine reaches herd immunity levels, interest rates remain near 0 and companies take off in the biggest bull market ever seen in 2021 going into 2022. 

B. The economy starts to recover, interest rates are raised as a result, housing and the stock market both ended a bear market for a year or two. 

I guess c if we are gonna have a c would be a mixture of both. Economy recovers. Fed SLOWLY  raises interest rates causing a stagnant market eventually leading to a period of a bear market. 

I say either way whatever you’re buying today in 10 years is gonna be worth a ton if it doesn’t go bankrupt and is managed wel. RE: PLTR, NIO, TSLA  all future technologies. I see GME as a short window opportunity and a watch and see approach. I’ll likely limit my portfolio as we get nearer to the 1 year mark. 

Either way inflation is gonna likely keep the market near stagnant if interest rates are raised as your valuation is more likely to follow inflation in the stock market than it is sitting in a bank account given how much money we’ve printed.

It is true. Because of it weren’t, people would have incentives to buy life insurance on celebrities and then murder them, for example. Instead of downvoting me because of your misunderstanding, how about you prove you’re right by calling up a life insurance company right now and telling them you’d like to buy life insurance on a random person you don’t know, based on their investing abilities. I’ll wait here. I’m sure you’ll be right back.
Downvotes for the only real answer

Thanks for putting this in writing, very true.   If I can add my own perspective [mortgage brokerage management/owner & Industry consultant], the housing market is insanely healthy.  Some numbers to consider:

- less than 1% of homeowners are not paid current on their primary residence 
-any foreclosures cannot even begin the process for at least 6 to 8 months 
-homeowners equity at all time high, so noone [virtually] is "underwater"
- less than 5% of mortgages this year went to people with a FICO score under 640
-credit standards remain at all time high to get a mortgage 

--> all the people who say the housing Industry is tettering are soooo uninformed
So no stimulus...... Why would we expect futures to be anything but red
So if everyone is using their unemployment checks for yolos, is it really necessary?

Nice try Melvin.  You’ll have to try harder than this weak-ass attempt to crack these 🖐🏻💎
Is interest rates being 0 from 2010 or whatever not the first time that happened? Is the Fed not printing crazy amounts of money digitally? With those things combined, are we not in a market that isn't normal? Because that's what you're basing your crash theory on, how things used to work.

Are there not companies with over 1000 PE ratios that continue to go up? Did we not see the quickest market crash recovery in history? Are the markets not manipulated? Did we not hit ATHs in the middle of a global pandemic? 

Pay attention.
Look at CRM and SAP, feels there is some room to grow and both are good companies.

lol its miniscule compared to the national outstanding debt and credit.
P/E is an almost worthless figure compared to revenue for growth companies.

If Tesla’s market cap based on its revenue was applied to Apple, Apple’s market cap would be over $6 trillion. But Tesla is foremost an auto maker, and will likely never have anywhere close to Apple’s big profit margins.

So Tesla is absurdly overvalued either way.
Tbf he never claimed to help anyone get rich quick. Getting rich slowly and painfully with lots of sacrifice isn't that hard to figure out, he just was smart enough to make a brand out of it.
What's the point of being blacked out? You'd only remember bits and pieces, at best.
I love the convenience of that number but seriously I'm wondering if that is too low.  Only gives it a $29B market cap.
Roll up and out eventually

It’s because funds are literally idiots who play with daddy’s money and fuck up most of the time. Retail is finally able to day trade with things like RH and a metric shit-ton of “work from home” going around, giving them the opportunity to day trade from home.

Seeing as I have the top comment in this thread, I nominate myself to receive flair from u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR
Don is nuts but last year of obama and pre covid Trump saw inequality income gap close for the first time in like 30 years because the economy was so hot so labor shortage, and don did have a growth at most costs agenda that added more fuel (plus deregulation).

Current status quo with just Biden president will roll back some regs and add new ones but will take a while. 

If he has Congress he will pass a bunch of stim and infrastructure but also a bunch of tax to offset the stim. The problem is that increases the percent of the economy that is government which tends to be lower productivity. So you potentially wind back the huge productivity gains we are getting and also cool the economy 

Status quo is we get 3 or 4% productivity gains annually due to digital improvements out of covid along with a red hot economy, along with low inflation, so best of all worlds, most people getting a lot richer at all income levels with pretty high certainty.
I’ll do it when I get to 10 mil

The CCP just set the guidelines they expect them to follow and BABA agreed and thanked them for the ass fucking.
All good bro the only way you learn is by asking.  As the earlier reply mentioned 
C = Call = Think the stock / etf is going up. 
$450 = the price at which your option will be in the money (close or at the price you expect it to go up to) 
DATE; they mentioned March.

SPY $450 C (03-19-21) 

Current price $369 
Expected Strike Price $450 (almost 22% out of the money. Personally really doubt it however the good thing is they are cheap. $9 per contract. Each contract gives you the right to buy 100 shares of SPY at $450 per share.  If by the due date SPY is trading at $500 you’re making bank.  However no one holds them and if the SPY goes up by 5% or more your option will appreciate according to the maturity and volatility.) that’s the summary but it gets more complicated.   

The counterpart of a CALL is a PUT which works in the same manner but the expected result is a 180 from a CALL.  

Everyone here has lost more money they are whiling go admit in the learning process.  Do your homework and start small. A small mistake and can get whipped out.  Good luck
Not sure.

I stopped by a local strip mall earlier today and decided to check out how the local Gamestops were doing. Several years ago, they had put up a second gamestop at the same strip mall, which didnt make much sense as they were directly competing with each other. Now though, the second Gamestop has been shuttered, and the original is the second busiest store at the mall on a slow Sunday. Customers were very diverse, of different ages and demographics, and there were no notable inventory issues. Bias was confirmed, $GME to $420.69 by April.

Rumor has it (I've not seen evidence) the cost basis of their short position was $40, opened in 2016. At current prices that is a 50% gain, until you count interest payments (likely approaching their gains at this point, as short positions have become expensive).

This also does not count additional positions. I believe they have lost a few percent buying puts and attempting market manipulation.

I have nothing to back this up, but I think despite shorting at $40 they are now losing money.

They’re very high maintenance so if I ever travel it’s only for one week because he sees me as mom. Lol
Fair enough. Man that is a substantial bet. I just spent the last hour reading up on him. The Herbalife death match with Carl Icahn makes for interesting reading. Ackman bet that Herbalife (which is indisputably a textbook pyramid scheme with extremely dubious practices) would go to zero. This is a great breakdown of exactly why, which I think was prepared by Ackman's team:

Ackman lost that round and lost a billion on the bet. Icahn made a billion betting the opposite.

They're like options, only there is no optionality.  The buyer and seller are both obligated.  It would give GME a basket of cash.  And they could use that to pay off remaining debt.  It would give Melvin (or anyone else) a guaranteed exit.

Of course, GME will have to file if they proceed with such a thing.  I just thought it was curious.

I too, am wondering this
Calls are a dumb idea on this. People don’t know enough about the company and are just speculating out their ass until they reveal more details on future deals, which could come at literally any moment

This is the ONLY time I would ever say this on WSB, but just buy stock and hold. At some point in 1-2 years it will be at $80+

Correct, but don't you need to fund 2000 USD to subscribe to data fees or go through a introducing broker, in that case it's 200 USD. Also, under 2000 USD account pays 30 USD per month unless they waive it with commission. So I would at least recommend 2000 USD.

Lol. I’ve been in since January! It was my free stock on Robinhood and I bought more over the year. Thanks for the calls.
In the industry as well, and we’re definitely not at 2008/2009 highs, but the supply shortage will continue to push prices higher in the short term. Once China wraps up their “steel shutdown for environmental reasons” in Q1, they could potentially flood the market. Just a heads up.

I mean, Brexit deal has been reached, possible 2k stimulus and starting of vaccination process. Don‘t know that‘s all a pretty relief.

We went out of town, and I left the window cracked and it jumped out and lived outside for a few days.

We moved back home and bought a house in the country and my wife let it outside on the reg again. Never came home one morning and her brother found it dead on the side of the road 1.5 miles from home.
Nah, it’s more that every other not retarded country knows that investing money into education is one of the best ways to improve the country.

Thank you for taking the spot as the most retarded member of this community
Pump and dumps are a thing. And if enough retail zombies buy into a large cap, they can move it. Once your shoeshine kid is talking about buying TSLA shares, for example.

Broad overall market is driven by institutions, usually. Stupid people buying cruise lines and airlines definitely helped them pop a few times this year, probably moved the Dow even. This isn't really normal behavior.

Then you have SPACs which are largely driven by retail investors trying to front run institutions for once instead of getting screwed on IPO day. Largely caused by institutions fucking over retailers one time too many (SNOW).
Is this just a witch-hunt now for any large vehicle parked on the side of the road or do they have a larger reason as to why it’s all blocked off?

What naked calls have you sold?
You can just as easily hedge a short by selling a put.  And there's no reason to think these were bought and not sold.

It would make more sense in this case to sell puts than to buy calls to hedge.

The volume pairing on this makes it appear (almost certainly) that it's a spread though.

And it would be weird for Melvin to be putting spreads on this (either bearish or bullish), IMO.
No, it’s a bunch of poor autists. If you think this sub is chads you’re missing the point
I figured 20 but I'd prefer your estimate.
Throw it away if it’s a dct also
True but let's not compare, say, spending leftover money on shares in a promising company to YOLOing a bank loan like this retard. There's always an element of gambling but there's definitely a safe area where returns can be really good without risking everything you have.

how are you different
Im still trying to figure if you pay the premium each trading day or only on the day you make the call... say we bought this exact call for 20K and it remains relatively constant but sometimes dipping below the strike price and rising back up. Do I pay each day to hold these contracts
Maybe could be through one of his existing SPACS that haven't announced yet.  I'm thinking IPOD, IPOE, and IPOF.  Has he indicated or announced his intent yet with any of these SPACS?  I recall on IPOB or IPOC their website stated they wanted an international tech company, but they keep going with US based companies.

Ya looks like the dude blew himself up in the rv
Yeah I get how they work, I just can’t find a definitive answer on if you still owe the deferred taxes if the fund fails due to fraud, embezzlement, nuclear war, or anything else. IE, I invested 50k in stocks and sold for $200k, took that 200k and put it all into a OZF, then the fund failed. Am i on the hook for the capital gains of that $200k still?
This is because by the time Cramer is saying it, it is already at the top of the pump and is about to get dumped, so if you inverse Cramer, you do decent.

It’s very real that unemployment is gone for 10s of millions today. All those people need to get money out of the market to pay bills and rent. If you don’t understand how much money that is for so many people maybe you should read more news articles
That's why over the last 18 months I've pretty much stopped talking with people. They don't want to hear about it, much as in Hold 'Em you don't want to educate your opponents...so I am not sharing any "knowledge"; and most of all, I really don't have time nor inclination for much else.

Part r/investing boomer, part r/wallstreetbets autist.  

Work for a tech giant which allows me to max out stuff like pre-tax 401k, back door roth, etc.  Leftover money is dumped into physical properties and stuff like big index funds and a REIT or two. Currently returning 54% profit on my big funds, our properties are paid off and doubled or tripled in value.  That's all long game money and the boomer side of things. 

Also can't help myself looking to make big money on stupid bets.  So I get drunk, come here, see a meme stock and invest in it.  Usually I start making huge returns, then like an idiot keep doubling down on a skyrocketing bet over the next few days - which dilutes or negates the gains from my initial buy (see MMEDF).  I also get way too conservative with trailing stop loss orders and exit a fund way too early, usually selling during a drop, then see that stock raise 300-500% over the next few months (see MRNA).  Sometimes I get lucky and buy the dip then hold (see BA).  Currently only returning 5% profit on this play money, which is barely worth the hassle but is fun.  This is all short term money and the autist side of things.

A 30 put will be priced according to how deep it's in the money, which in your hypothetical is $10 ITM.  A 30 put won't cost 300 premium near expiration - it will cost 1000 because it's $10 ITM so one contract will be worth $1000.

I might be naive, but isn't it a better time to buy into steel companies when prices are just about to go up, rather when they are even scraping totally fine ships just to sell them as scrap metal? This only confirms that prices are insanely high now.

Dude who THE FUCK CARES ABOUT THE TONE OF NEWS ARTICLES THERE MEANT TO SCARE RETARDS LIKE YOU!!! Read news articles with a healthy dose of skepticism!!!
FDX. It just got pulled back but it going to moon soon
I've tried them. Nice platform and research, only web platform though and I prefer desktop. High spreads on index CFD's and no options whatsoever. They do however file the taxes for you, at least in Sweden. Also great customer support and highly regulated. But if you are going for CFD's I think IG is cheaper but they have a minimum deposit req.
You wouldn't understand them as they're speaking another language.
well I canceled the calls I had sent in for tomorrow morning since I think we may get a slight pull back over the next week, and I want to buy during a drawdown

Dear WSB members who work for Google and can feed this up the chain;

1. No one likes miniplayer, just put a search bar in the recommended list on the right side of the screen, i can search and watch at the same time. *N0 ONE WANTS MINIPLAYER*

2. Autolevel the volume, your ads and videos can all be set to the same volume so we, the viewer, can set our speakers accordingly and dont need to endlessly adjust volumes from one video to the next

3. if you put a video in front of me 28 times a day and i dont click it, USE THAT FUCKING DATA AND FIND ANOTHER VIDEO TO RECOMMEND ME

My advice, you've done this well without options, Don't fix what ain't broke. Don't let the "Guys I made 49458904358738957354875% return on my YOLO" posts steer you down that road either.

...how much of your capital are you putting into each of these trades?

When I buy debit spreads, I let them expire, because they often enough come back and if they don't, they're less than 2% of my trading capital.

You should not be opening spreads where you can't afford to lose the entire debit without it being a big problem. In a normal market your debit goes to 50% loss very frequently, and if you start compounding that you'll be done in months.
Stimmy talks going well 🐂🐂
In my experience they do like muscle but prefer the cut-up lean kind of muscle. I mean this is getting more into speculation but low-body fat and your genetics aka inserts seem to be the biggest thing. Like abs, wide shoulders. 

You surprised me about Latinas. I wonder if maybe you have just had bad luck with a relatively small sample size. If you're actually pretty big try to go to africa hahaha. 

Okay yeah if you like being a sub you're going to in general have a tougher time with women, I mean, most girls are naturally kinda submissive so the reason you might do well with worshiping white girls is they have giant egos hahahaha. I mean I am sure you can find girls who will like it but idk man. You sound like how I used to be. 

How is your self-esteem? I used to be obsessed with eating pussy and being yeah more "worshipful" in bed but as my self esteem and confidence has grown now I like fucking better, it feels more animalistic. Now it's more like the occasional appetizer to eat pussy than the main course.

If you can channel that feeling of "worshipping" into "she's so fucking hot I need to nut in her right away" kinda deal it's more what most girls like, I mean you do you obviously

Very big news today on Chinese media
Hopefully the insiders trading guy wasn’t selling us his bags and the BB weeklies print
Shorting is bearish. They want the price to go down. They make or lose based on their buy back price. They secure the 15$ profit immediately once they sell, and have to buy back the share at whatever the market price is. So they want the stock to go down so they can buy it back cheaper than what they sold it for.
Buy or sell ? Positions?
This movie was fucking great

How many just buy online versus going to to a GME store? They probably should close additional stores quickly to reduce overhead and massive rents.

Been following WSB for like 4-5 years but just for the memes and loss porn. Never really even knew what options were. Decided to drop some money in Robinhood in October after my wife's boyfriend started doing it and I got jealous because I had been following WSB for so long that I should be the one who was talking about it. Plan was to drop $500, turn it into a couple stacks, take out my $500 and play with house money until I yolo it all away. Long story short, I ended up putting another $500 in because I'm a degenerate but I'm up 80% as of last week thanks to GME and daddy Cohen. After the squeeze I'll take my initial investment out then see how fast I can make it to 1 million or zero
I agree, it's steep. But on the positive side there is no monthly activity fee unless you are inactive for 6 month than it's 100 USD. And they pay back data fees if you meet certain commission. However, I'm wondering if the custody fee involves options? Anyone know?

Milennials own 3% of total US wealth compared to baby boomers, who owned 21% of total US wealth when they were the same age. You’re lying if you think  it’s just as easy to build wealth now as it was back then. Now I’m not saying to bitch and moan about it, but you should still expect some accountability from the government about this trend. Don’t just take the extreme increase in difficulty to build wealth as a “welp that’s just the way world works.” That’s just lazy

Yes, I know what the C stands for. You then proceeded to list a bunch of things that backup my claim that it is a dictatorship. How did nothing to show it is a communist system. Because it is not. The state does not own the farmland for example and have the workers work on it for the benefit of others rather than themselves. China figured out it should give its people individual property right so that they own their own farms and work for themselves because they become a lot more efficient and productive. It’s called communist because it used to be communist. But now it’s largely a (somewhat) free market system but with a dictatorship presiding over it.
I mean I blame congress as much as I blame trump for the stimulus bill. Guess senate is going blue unless people in Georgia don’t think for themselves.

Quad Witching, that was a good one.
Any plays i can do with 4k that i can just make an extra 700 bucks over the next few weeks?
Not true. I know a lot of ppl that work there or have worked there in the past that have yet to sell even their 20% that they could have when it DPO’d.

What you fail to realize is that this company is not your so called typical tech company in that Palantir hires very specific people that are truly believe in the mission of the company and the long term success of the company.

People also fail to realize that since Palantir did a DPO, they actually have more shares in the market than to a company that did an IPO. IPO companies have about 10% of shares actually in float before the 6 month lockup period. Palantir has 20-25% of shares currently in float. There may be a sell off but I don’t think it will be as big as people think. 

Lastly, Palantir has some very very smart leadership. They did not have to DPO to raise money since they can easily raise money on the private market. They have been mulling going public for a while so I am extremely confident that they have a plan in place to wow Wall Street quarter after quarter. Should get a clearer picture of that during their upcoming demo day and Q4 earnings

Getting out of sub 5k is hard. I’d always recommend at least that for starting out because trying to even get a 2-3 bagger on $1000 is hard because you have to go all in to see any gains

You can never keep a bubble inflated, that's why it's a bubble. It requires exponentially increasing inflows to keep the price expanding at a constant rate. Even with the shit that's happening now with the Fed, there is never a consistent exponentially expanding source of capital.

When Tesla is at 1 berjellion dollars per share, it only takes a couple people deciding they'd like to actually have that money in their hands to drop the price hard, because at that point selling shares is easy, but having the cash to buy them is incredibly hard. Once it starts dropping, the fear sets in.
Who gives a fuck just buy calls

Your second paragraph mostly. I’d love to watch but it’s not required, it’s actually hotter to me if she tells me she’s gonna meet up another guy and then just lets my imagination run wild.
Tell her to buy nkla. Read about Apple and Nio potential partnership but it could also be nkla with their groundbreaking hydrogen self-propelling-downhill technology.

I invest in poop coins it’s pretty funny that people talk about diversifying. Like someone telling me to balance out my MSFT with AAPL. Or buy more Gold with my Silver.
What companies are you referring to as “fat” for CIBR? Their holdings look pretty good to me...
problem is even if you are right and Tesla is a bubble, if you short it now you might go under if it bursts too long from now. It's the same issue as timing the market generally; you can forecast a bubble bursting, but not getting the timing right can still screw you.
🤓 yessir
Does Weekend DOW even matter?
But that's only when you expect it to go up? You can lose by shorting as well when the stock fails expectations? What if in this scenario it never hit 15 but dropped from 10 to 7.5.

Maxed out my 401k and have had a great match.

&#x200B;

Bought my first stock in 2008 before the crash.  Bought PFE which did nothing for 2 years.  Then I bought MRVL stock because I wanted to invest in Marvel and all the comic book movies.   Had no idea they got bought out by Disney.

I have accumulated about 1 million in my 401k over the last 16 years due to boomer investing.

Low fee index funds.

I had about 900k in January and sold it all to cash from reading about covid.

But sat on the sidelines till about May.  So I missed the run up.

Invested in PRPL in august and learned a lot about options.   Turned 200k in to 400k, then dropped back down to 300k.

Took my Roth IRA ( Kids college funds currently) from 40k to 80 in the last few months on PLTR and now GME.

Lost some money in TSLA Puts so far ( but only what I made in TSLA Calls)

So far learned a lot and made about 280k this year.

I got a GMC Sierra. 4 runners are dope bro
Nah.
Preaching to the choir, mate. There is only one time I held an option that was even close to that green, because normally I sell when I see sufficiently positive gains based on my expectations which is generally never more than 5x and is generally more in the 1.2x-3x range. The only exception were Tilray calls which I held overnight and overnight it became a 30 bagger back on its magical run to 300 (though I think this call was bought one day and sold the next back when it was around 180 or something). 

But like I said these people don't think like we do, hence why they can pull off what they did.
I think im addicted to investing. Everytime i see people buying things like tech or gaming devices all I see is money that could have been invested.

Also I jerk off to my balance sheets.

There is no foreign aid in the 900B covid bill, anyone who says otherwise is dumb af.

Basically yes. For commercial buildings they look at debt coverage ratio. This is a building over 4 units. https://www.c-loans.com/debt-service-coverage-ratio you can also get non recourse loans meaning the bank can’t come after your personal assets if you default. But those are hard to get unless you are looking at really large deals with a strong history

That's how I did it on about $200 a month... heck I still eat rice, beans, egg... and veggies and fruit as normal meals even though I could afford "nicer" meals.

I'm more comfortable betting on China economy right now than the US economy. US economy is literally a ponzi scheme right now and the only reason it is not failing is because of all the money injected in the last several months. They will have to keep injecting or this house of cards will collapse soon.
Is this a trump tweet?
They also have shares shorted, but there is no way to track it. Hedge funds usually do that on shares together with options.
Anyone else riding the XL train to see where it goes? I personally think it’s the best EV-ish stock out there now with a massive amount of potential. Institutions with an ESG focus will be gobbling it up next week.
Address?
They’ve bought puts, their risk is equal to the premium paid ($28.8M). In other words, however much GME moves above the strike price, they don’t stand to lose more. This is fundamentally different from shorting, where loss potential is infinite when share price goes above the price at which you shorted. In other words, you do stand to lose more when GME rises up, so in this case you are compelled to buy to cover, unless your short is hedged. Normally, you hedge a short by buying a call above the shorted price, so, I mean, nobody is saying that Melvin will somehow be compelled to buy 5.1M shares or something.

You are correct. P/E ratio doesn't matter for a rapidly growing company since they are constantly reinvesting in infrastructure and capital. They are watching their cash and actually having too high of earnings is a waste - they could have reinvested that money instead. When they "level off" and stop growing so fast (i.e. hopefully once they've captured a huge amount of market share), then they'll stop reinvesting so much cash and earnings will catch up to a normal profit margin, reaping the rewards of their growth at that point. Look at Amazon revenue vs profit as they grew:

https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/4298/amazons-long-term-growth/

What does still matter for a growing company though is P/S (price to sales). While they're growing, even if their profit (earnings) isn't high, the fact that they are growing should mean their top line sales (revenue) is growing like crazy. TSLA sales are growing very quickly, but their market cap has grown significantly faster, meaning they have a P/S ratio of almost 20. A normal S&P 500 company has a P/S ratio of like 2. So we're pricing in an implied growth in sales of at least 10x from here. It sounds less horrendous than P/E 1,500 but I still think it's high. Tesla has a great headstart but there's LOTS of competition coming quickly from established players.
Remember that selling a call means you have to sell the shares to someone else at the strike price. So if it goes over 30, you have to sell 100 shares at $30. But you have your 25c which lets you buy them for $25. So you make $500 on the overall transaction. Minus whatever you paid for the spread of course.
Who cares about research

Yeah too true, Asian girls like do not give a fuck about muscles at all it seems and that’s my main calling card. Latinas also don’t really care for muscles, it’s white girls who usually love my body most. Especially British girls lol they seem to ducking love roided up dudes haha. Just kinda got resentful towards Asian chicks and avoid them, I can basically remember like just 2 Asian girls off the top of my head that liked me and fucked around. 

Yeah most Latinas don’t want a Machismo guy, they want a dominant guy but not a machista. But I like being the sub one with women so it doesn’t work out with Latinas usually bc they want to be treated like slurs in bed and all I wanna do is worship their bodies instead hahaha

This is retarded even for WSB. GME is up 30% last week and a 3% pullback on a half day, low volume holiday signifies a huge crash? 

I do think there will be some pullback to the upper teens (as it’s done twice already) before it rockets again, the short attacks will probably keep coming, but this shit isn’t crashing unless RC pulls. Considering he’s recently been buying more makes that a very low risk.

24 yr old accountant that doesnt know wtf to do with my life. Still living with my parents, been subbed to WSB for years but never to the leap and put some money in an acc cus i was broke. Finally got a job plus unemployment and stashed bread all year. Saved about 16k and Idk what it was but i made transfer into my old acc. About 12k, just messed with shares but options looked so tempting, sold low and bought high cus i have paper hands since November and now im down 3k. Man, sometimes i think the hope this sub gives us plebs from the gain porn really screws our mentality. Thinking of unsubbing so i dont have to look at this bs anymore, but damn the memes are so relatable. Anyway, trying to work my way toward 20k, all in on QQQJ march and june calls atm.

All of them, except Fintech.
Well, you're not specifically asking anyone but here's what I've found to be good useful info:

If you trade for 5-10%, that's fine, if it works out long term. It's certainly the 'book way' to trade options.  However that means massively outsized risk to your expected return; months of hard work can get f'd if you're 80% into deep ITM / less volatile options as a mid term investment.  And if I'm only using 20% of my acct for options generally, that means I can't do so much and income will be slow.

There's a reason people like spreads - for me its odds.  If a spread pays 1-2 and I have a 75% PoP, great, im there, usually til the end if its where I want/need.  Obviously there's exceptions, I closed TSLA 600/605 and 610/612.5 bull verts expiring x mas eve day on Wednesday, they were already at 95% max, and why take that risk?

Then, i say, do make some more speculative trades.  This dudes a gambler, and I love to gamble but even I wouldn't have these sorts of risk / reward scenarios as trades.  But, if you specialize- i mean really, every day every news piece etc. - you can be speculative and successful.  You'll lose sometimes of course, but the 2-500% of a gain makes up for it.  But at the very least I say go spreads where it's at least 50% max profit, and w the right movement, you can snag a 200% max spread w high confidence.

Ultimately though, its the long run that matters and if lots of small gains equals out then who cares? It's definitely just a gambling rush thing when ppl start shootin for the moon
#Can’t wait to limit up 🆙
very kind of op to help others in comments as well. just wondering, do you tend to put calls 6-12months out?

Asian girls are the ones most attracted to me. My buddy has the same thing where they aren't attracted to him, he's jacked and more the med look. Many asians, if they are going to go for white guys, seem to prefer the super white, blue eyed, kinda average test looking face vs the hyper-masculinized features being better for pulling a lot of different ethnicities. Captain ASo of course I love asians the most haha it's like a positive feedback loop.

Keep an open mind about latinas and stuff. Cause you can basically do well with a progressive latina, they will seem super un-woke and occasionally make comments about the chinese but they are not looking for machismo, that's why they pick you, right? Cause they want something different.

And okay yeah california white girls hnnng. I guess another thing is that I live in a first world country so everyone is fat like majority of population is overweight

No way, shutdowns are unfortunately normal and stimmy will pass there's a veto proof vote.  Either way come the 20th we're on the fast track to pumping
What’s freaky to you exactly?
Current stimmy bull is **permanently** dead unless trump signs it.  Unless Trump signs it into law, the current bill expires when the current congress expires.  A new bill will need to be voted on by both house and senate and sent to trump or Biden. Almost everything can go wrong with that plan.  I’m just here spreading Christmas cheer yo.

IMHO you are too early on this play.
You have to very accurately predict the growth pattern and have no downside protection.  I'd prefer diagonal spreads with flatter blue chip to this strategy personally.  Prefer selling CCs of growth stocks to either of those as well.

Hell, a single tweet from Musk can still probably get people to buy calls.

Scenario: you are holding a long position (held less than 1 year) that is up currently but you expect it to dip temporarily in the near future.

I’m trying to figure out when it makes sense to:

1) Close the long position
Pro: avoid exposure to the dip
Con: You lock in short term capital gains

And when it makes sense to:

2) Hedge
Pro: avoid short term tax, mitigate exposure to dip
Con: your long position remains exposed
Lmao I doubt it would but first week but if it does then sounds like you’ll get to happily roll

I have 0 regrets with any of the investments I’ve made and I would’ve made my mistakes all over again. Sometimes you can make the right trade and still lose(especially in options), which is why I look at the Greeks before buying options even if I think I have a guaranteed winner(also work the bid/ask spread). Dw we have different investment strategies, and I enjoy buying an allotment of weeklies for pennies to gain dollars. Consistent 100-300%+ gains are how dumb people like myself stay on top while only hitting 80%ish of the time.

Idk if it would be boring. The genius in Apple is making things just work and giving you a great all around experience, coupled with great industrial design. I wouldn't call that boring.

Probably it wouldn't be as fast as a Tesla, or have "fart mode", and a wide selection of options. But it would likely be more functional - the driving experience, the feature set, innovative small things I can't obviously predict etc. would be tuned to perfection. This assuming they could transfer their success in the past to car design, which is a big question.
Best I can do is tree fiddy

Why
Because they’re sending out millions of our money to foreign countries. Are you people fucking retarded?

Honestly losing $24k isn't the worst thing that can happen. Tighten your belt (financially) pay it back as you can and stop gambling and learn to invest after you pay it back. You're young enough to be fine.

Tesla is not a deep value company. They could sell every car in the world and not be worth what it's priced.
Some latinas though are like. Super mixed with spanish and consquistadors. I mean there's a buncha different whites too. I don't like the kind of polish looking white girls and honestly find the english kind to be a bit bland and potatoey. A great mix is like. 75% white with a lil something something to keep it interesting. 

Also blue eyed non-whites are fucking hot.

Honestly I'd like white girls a lot more if they liked me as much as other races haha.

Pay the fee, you get 0 tax on investments
Kinda wonder how it works because abnormally high number of stocks reached 52wk high. It's probably the rise in put buying from November lows that offset it overall.
Who cares?
So you dumped about 20K into GME calls? Nice.
Ahhh, i understand. You mean the company that is now about 13,50$ a share? Right?
Assuming you held on to this position for less than 1 year, prolly about 30-40% depending on state taxes.
Chuck I will straight drop your panties
Yea 1b market cap required? Lol wtf. Stocks over $5 probably should be allowed ( dont need pump n dump Otc and penny).  Instead we see 2500 gain "porn" ( hard to fap to personally unless its worth more then my 2006 honda)

Short version: Lumen is basically CenturyLink plus Level 3, who they bought in 2017 for $25 billion. Level 3 is the future of the company, but they kept the old CenturyLink CEO for about a year after the acquisition and it really screwed up the company. Then the old CEO of Level 3 came out of retirement and has been turning things around.


CenturyLink is the albatross around the neck of the company. It has a lot of the debt and makes...not a lot of money. The current thinking is that they're going to undo the merger and Lumen will just be Level 3. Even if they don't do that though, they're still paying down CenturyLink's debt currently.


The market doesn't see it like that. They just see a ton of debt and no way for a company to get out of it. But it's ignoring a very profitable branch within the company.

that’s bs tesla pumping rumors that people made up just to hype tesla more. Almost all of these companies are already pretty well progressed in EV and some even in self driving as well. iirc bmw intends to one day have an EV fleet in China where the vehicles are rented on a day to day base by customers. The idea that these giants are just laying down and letting tesla have the auto market is just absurd

Sure
I bought puts Wednesday for December 31.  I suck my own dick if hit 10 dollars by then lol. I’m hoping for mid 16s
Naw. I am thinking it could be over $30 by March/April.  I was actually pretty surprised it hit $22 and has stayed over $20 so early.

Right, you never own it, as yours, per se. In my previous response. You made 15$ by selling, you lost 10$ by having to buy back from the market, so in turn you kept the 5$ minus the interest accrued on the position (brokers charge interest rates while they've lent their shares.)

I too have 1k shares at $7
Got laid off from a job in 2003.  It had a pension plan, and I was cashed out of it and handed a large amount of dough.

Could have lived off of the cash for a few years, but 2 days after I was laid off, I was offered a job at a place I really wanted to work at, for about 3 times more cash than I had been making.  Took the job.

Took the pile of pension money and YOLOed it into AAPL.  At the time, it was around $14 a share.

Being lazy and a procrastinator, I never cashed it out.  Look where that got me.

While on the job, I started trading as I was telecommuting from home, with multiple computers in front of me (including my personal one - never use your employer's computer for anything but the employer's business).

&#x200B;

First trade I did was on a company I had done DD for about an hour.  My trade lasted about 15 seconds.  I netted more money on that trade than I would net working at my job for two months solid.

Totally hooked, and I've been fortunate.  After leaving the "real" job in 2016, trading has allowed me to "work" from anywhere in the world, set my own hours, and not have to answer to anyone but myself.  I love it.

\[Having the fat, soft AAPL cushion helps as well.  When they started paying out a divvy, it just got nicer...\]
I was doing that too, consistently losing money.  But that is the heart of my question- what’s a reasonable insurance policy?

Idea for next week, anyone also holds AZN???

Did you bust on PFE, BNTX & MRNA?  If so look at AZN should pump hard soon.   

As of Wed close AZN is down over 4% for the year and over 12% for the last 3 months.  WHY?

-Recently acquired AXLN 

-In Oct posted conflicting vaccine update

-UK based and due to Brexit volatility most of the FTSE listed companies have seen a sell off. 
 
However seems the UK & India are about to approve AZN’s vaccine (might even happen tomorrow).  Like with the other vaccine stocks don’t think the pump will last too long so it would be a pump & dump.  
Overall it’s a cheap stock with a low IV so the calls will pump even harder.
It's a spac so of i say it in a normal way the comment gets removed. But seriously look it up it's a company that can connect satellites with normal mobile phones and give them a 4/5G connection anywhere in the world. It already has partners like Vodafone, at&t and American towers

He was, he first criticized Cramer on air for telling someone calling into Mad Money that keeping their money in Bear was fine, inferring that it was in Bear Stearns stock, then Cramer responded on Mad Money providing the context of the clip which was that the guy calling in had an FDIC insured wealth management account, so Cramer's advice was fine because the money was safely insured. 

Then Stewart dug up another clip about discussing in investing in Bear Stearns to redeem himself.

Not surprised. Overtrading is usually fail. But there's a handful of times where you win by hitting the eject button early - see NIO, XPEV, LI, CRSR, JKS, ZM, BABA, and others I'm sure. That requires accurately calling the top though, which is pretty fucking hard to do

Trade school is not the better option for alot of people, you are completely selling your body and torturing yourself for under 6 figures with the exception of some positions. 

And it was never the case back then 'get a college degree or you're fucked'. Any regular job wouldve done justice and college was pretty cheap.

The 'get a college degree or you're fucked' is now, and statistically true. Most people without a post secondary education are alot worse off then those who have one. 

Sure the stigma is fucked and schools/parents need to do a better job at presenting the options. Its way more the system how things are done, then college itself. But the debt is menial if you go into any decent program.... tech, most STEM or going for a doctorate for example in some areas will all pay your debt with ease you just gotta be smart.
I bought some. Seems overpriced af but the MM want it overpriced for now. So when the dump does happen they make all the money. Whatever. Bought 80p and 100p for 1/15. Hope it drops like a rock

Yeah I think everyone knows it's overvalued, even people buying Tesla calls. I actually think it will to continue to increase for a bit, but not at the same pace since it was added to the S&P. Once again, Burry is probably in a little too early and it'll be interesting to see if he's forced to exit his positions because of it.


The really dangerous thing about TSLA is how it can now have a massive effect on the rest of the market. If the value plummets because people realize they don't actually make money, it could be a disaster. So many passive investors suddenly own TSLA and don't even realize it.


Not saying they're the next Enron, but their valuation is absurd.
And they ban tickers that actually have play and allow pump and dump stocks. K C A C (QS) was banned for the longest time. Was $10 and now $120
You are going to be so fucking disappointed January 6th.

To avoid having to always up price targets on TSLA, analysts should just say “higher.”

Not really, it "popped" from 26 and change to 27 and a half. I unloaded it the following week for a .15c a share loss. Didn't seem like a bad company to own but for long term slow moving holds I can buy a better index fund.

Oh yeah I see what you mean. You’re right, theta decay would be less of an issue once you’re ITM. I’m doing a similar spread with PLTR but my spread is a bit more narrow. The only worry I’d have with selling the short leg after it breaks through 30 is that PLTR can have +/- 10% swings so your long leg could go back to OTM pretty quick..

But you’re right, you could definitely time legging out well and make bank. I’m just personally bad at timing it so I try to minimize my own risk is all

If OP gets his shares called away, that means PLTR rose above $35 within the week. He bought his shares for $27 each, so being obligated to sell at $35, nets a profit of around $35k in a week. Then OP can just buy back his shares whenever and run another set of CCs

Close, shorting a position is borrowing a share from a broker/institution. The shorter sells their borrowed share, at $15 a share let's say. They make profit if the stock price decreases, let's say to $10. They then give back the share from the broker they borrowed from, and keep the $5 minus and interest.

I remember reading somewhere in total all shorts have lost 1 billion this year. Take it with a grain of salt though cause I don't remember where I read that.
Yes, but also a 4 year degree isn’t worth what it used to be. Trade school would be a better option for a lot of people these days. College is fine but it’s no longer the case that you need to get a college degree or you’re fucked, which was sorta true a few decades back 

The point I’m really trying to make is that parents/teachers/whoever who are still telling 16 year olds that they NEED to go to college need to shut the fuck up, going into student debt without a plan is terrible advice.
play it slow, and calm down

trying to play riskier and riskier to regain lost money is always a bad spiral

stay calm and levelheaded
Sounds good, you should all in PACB, PLTR, LGVW and CRSP

Broker can force you to liquidate at any time. You should never use and hold 100% or your margin.
Trying to come up with a formula to calculate the optimal play considering tax implications for when you are holding a net positive play that you expect to go down temporarily in the near future. Like when does it make sense to hedge short term puts and hold thru and when does it make sense to just take profits and lock in short term gains.

Anyone have a good formula put together already?
This is the way.
What’s wrong with puts? I buy a few far OTM that I roll month-to-month. I’m fully expecting to lose money on them unless shit hits the fan and they will print massively, I see it like insurance

It was trending on stock twits the day the news broke taking it from like 2-$12. At noon it was down to $8. I knew the news was huge for Trump and was a political hot topic that Trump would talk about. I had no idea he would do it literally after market close and set off my most epic gain

Gaming hasnt really popped yet; I strongly feel like game manufacturers just dont 'get it'. e.g. Games in the 90s were actually higher quality than what we have today, which is utterly ridiculous

  
Theres room for someone to step in. Will GME be a part of that? Probably, with Cohen; but who can say
Maybe P/E ratio doesn't really matter as much as people think? There are no official rules to what makes people want to buy a stock, maybe people are investing in tesla for other reasons than the so called "fundamentals".

Bears don't want to fuck with you. They really don't. Even, and especially, grizzlies. They'll fuck you up if they feel threatened but a little bit of knowledge and preparedness goes a long way. Ive heard that black bears are actually responsible for more attacks on people than grizzlies. Usually its one of two things: somehow your dumb ass ended up between a mama bear and her cub, or you didn't secure your food away from your tent. Really easy to not fuck up. The animal you really have to worry about up north isn't the bears, its the moose. Those motherfuckers beat you into a bloody pulp for looking at it the wrong way if they're feeling ornery.
Trump should sign immediately! My mother is about to lose her job as a Gender Studies professor in Karachi!!
Sorry I confused myself. Don’t have to work about assignment at long as you’re OTM. The only thing you have to worry about is bid/ask. You need decent enough volume on the spread to even receive any credit and you’ll have to cough up the rest as collateral. You’ll be risking X collateral for minimal return, and unless you plan to hold to expiry, exiting on low volume will be almost impossible or you’ll have to sacrifice like half your profit to make a bid somebody will actually take. When initially sell the spread, you want to ask a lot, but when you close it, you don’t want to bid a lot, that results in lots of waiting on open orders or compromising and making less money, all while hoping the asset doesn’t tank and you get eaten alive. Moral of the story is nothing is free money. Play around with some smaller positions and see what I’m talking about.

I can’t wait for tesla to have a massive crash so I can finally get in on the action
Paying a shit ton of taxes is a good thing. Means you are winning!! I never think about taxes during any trades.
Started with a few hundred in august on Robinhood with plans to invest for exactly one year to buy a house. 20k in a year was my goal with as much invested during that time, of my own money, that I thought safe. 

I put 10k in, in two 5k installments in early September (lol worst time in that period. Oh well). The market too a massive shit and I invested a final 5k, 1k at a time, playing mainly options. Lost 1.2k on my first ever weekly on Microsoft and learned my lesson. Since they I rarely take losses, especially not big ones. I traded stock a few times, took some gains and losses, missed some tops and bottoms but all in all:

TL;DR - up 25% at close last week. Up about 4k to 19k total. No yolos like you guys but I’m very happy with that finish. I’m hoping to close around next September up to 25k and start scaling out until December, where I’ll start house hunting. :)

I’m around 85% stocks (no memes) at any given time, give or take, so I should never take a massive, house crushing, blow.

Dr PP is a well respected analyst and has a nearly 100% track record on his calls.  Based on his analysis I’d buy the highest strike, shortest dated calls you can find for AAPL tomorrow at the bell
Tesla’s big growing pains were because Musk was inexperienced with supply chains, and so they were unable to get enough cars out to be profitable. Tim Cook became COO of Apple because he was good at building supply chains. The iPhone supply chain has thousands of manufacturing sites in 6 continents. 

Tesla’s real moat is the “cool tech” factor. It’s simply cool that it’s electric. The car design is sleek and futuristic. It has many settings that other cars don’t have, like custom sounds for the car horn. It has a powerful engine. A Tesla is simply a really fun car. Apple could conceivably make an electric car to scale, but it would be boring like a Toyota.

Can confirm that the market being closed on Friday was not made up for by my kids opening presents. Not after the GME run up.
F
Yes
So basically you’re saying Calls on PLTR?
how about cutting them off now and having them reattached when it goes up over 100%
If you let anyone get by on easy mode,  yes,  you're failing as a parent.  She can earn her $5 a week doing chores and from there she can choose how to spend or invest it. 

When she whines about being broke,  you can flex about your 300% gains on TSLA 0dtes,  she'll want in and you can then flex further when she loses everything buying DIS 0dtes. That's tough love. Builds character.

Amazing!!! how far out options did you buy?
Thats too retarded... Even for this sub.

I bake with reggie. When I can get a bow for 100, damn right I will. Take advantage of the markets when you can. But for actual inhalation and hits to the dome, 200 dollar ounces. With an average of 20ish%. A bit low for my liking, but whatever.
I’ve read the financials and set ups.  PSTH actually seems like a decent long term one esp if Ackerman can get stripe.
My mom spent more than this on Plan B last month.

Looking to get back in. I also like ARKQ, nobody talks about it. Automation is gonna be huge the next 1-3 years.
I know it has that association and i wish it didn't.. i genuinely enjoy cognac. I have to confess i did buy a bottle of Henny because of the rapper mentions, just to see what all the hype was about. It is good, sweeter and maybe a bit less harsh than Remy Martin. They only had VS in stock at my local place, the Remy i tried was VSOP. Have not tried and XO or XXO's yet but would like to next special occasion/excuse i have to buy some.
What’s the luckiest play you made this year?
Where’s that remind me bot when you need it?
Sure, but isn’t it a little bit overvalued?
A couple ways, balance transfer straight to my checking from Discover, my $18k card at my bank is my overdraft for my checking so I can just transfer money straight into E*Trade.  I have great credit and make good money at my regular job so they know I am a good credit risk.

I may or may not be at an airport at the time of writing this.
I'm starting investing at 16 with about 2k. How should I invest when I don't have a lot of capital, do I need to go all in?
I'm super new, so obviously I need to get into options right away with all of my savings. And the best place to learn in in the comments on WSB right?

When I'm ready to sell my calls, do I need to have enough cash on hand to buy them at the price I set to re sell them at the higher price? Or just the price that I bought the calls for in the first place?

Like in your example do you just get all those shares for $0.50 each? Or do you pay $10 each when they are really worth $20?
Oh fuck yeah
ARKG will literally have another 100% year in 2021 or I will cut my balls off. Not even kidding. I’ve got 60k in leaps that’s how confident I am

Looks overbought...will take a look after consolidation.

Monday is gonna fucking suck, holy shit.
The lil research I did almost all her ETFs shot TF up this year, idk how I'm not in on it. GME gains going straight to TSLA and Ark Invest ETFs.

Fuck, I started watching it then moved over to Spotify and it has probably been playing for 2 hours straight.

Sold a shit ton of puts at my desired entry point
GS never fucked you... They made an offer.... You chose to sell it to them at the price they offered...

 You had the ability to take your game and sell it elsewhere...

If anything they provided a form of liquidity in the market... You may not have had the ability to sell the game otherwise.... other than maybe to a pawnshop. Which would give you similar prices.

GS also gave you more in store credit allowing you to  leverage your old game into a better trade for a newer game.

I dont grt why so many ppl think they got fucked over... You willingly walked into their strore and and chose to accept their offer... You could have easily left with your game... Maybe im too stupid to see it smh 😑
Haha.
added about 10k worth of jan 2022 leaps on Fri

PLTR because they are so new to the market and will only continue to grow their close ties to big money and institutions, including whole governments
I just set up a custodial etrade account for my kid.  I think I'll set her up with ICLN, TAN, PAWZ, ARKG, ARKF, etc.

The only thing is I'm nervous this will outperform my own account, and she won't learn the valuable lesson of avoiding making retarded decisions with her money.

Am I failing as a parent.
ELI5: How is the avg cost $0.50? Is that the price OP paid per stock?
Yeah, exactly right. Cheers!
But can you turn this into -2000% or are you just a one tricky pony?
Nice work man, GME rewards those who hold the line and have hands of steel. I FOMOd on the first run to 15$ and averaged down to 13.75 when it dropped to 11$. Now up 50%
Some retards able to feed me some no brainer LEAPS plays to buy and forget for next 12 months ?? Asking for a friend

Yea i don’t think I ever went negative but yea it shows that I went negative somehow.
Hard disagree. The fed is pumping money in; the whole market is rising. This might be a bear economy, but its a bull market  


This is said over and over again, but I feel like people really dont get it. Politics is linked to economics, if you ignore what the FEDs doing it all seems random

Alright guys. I will go all in and be the u/DeepFuckingValue of AMC. See y'all in 2 years.
Can someone explain why all my options fall.apart yet my 2k in fake internet money is making 50% gains over the weekend

T should be a solid play. Not only for 5G, but hbomax has been a top 5 download over Xmas (at times #1), and they’re working with space mobile on satellite based service. It’s also in a dip and undervalued rn.

Calls are cheap with currently low IV too, I have a few with July expirations. When hbomax numbers come out and more info is released from space mobile (they’re going public with a SPAC right now) I hope to see it pop.
I'm from Hungary. I'll try IB, thank you dear stranger.
Wow I never thought about that
Where do we think GME will finish at this week ?
Markets going to crash I guess
Just sell everything and buy GME shares, we're going +800% (at least) when the squeeze squeezes sometime between Jan and April
Everyone except me who buys puts constantly

Summary of events (literally no options I’m not that autistic)

1) $WKHS in summer
2) *the game changer* Kodak yolo bought 10k shares at $8 sold the next day at $43 (knew Trump would pump the fuck out of it)
3) Then TSLA ,NIO and RUN
4) a little bit of CRSR AND BA
5) back to TSLA 
6) QS and VLDR
7) now all in on $XL. 
[vid on XL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK-u4FRD_Sg)

Good luck. This Bull run should go until people have to go back to work (like for real work, when we all can’t just day trade and answer 1 or 2 emails a day shit we’ve been getting away with at the moment)
Music performance...that's on me
I have shorts on tesla. From March. Yeah. Big brain time.

Disney should buy AMC. They would kill it with the merch they would sell. They could do mini Disney stores within the theaters. 

Plus, they could cycle and play one of their older Disney movies each week on one of the screens that would attract a cult following.
SPACs seem so fake.  Only one I got in was DKNG.  Seems like no brainer to 100 at least.  Been selling calls on my shares as it runs not too fast

More dead boomers means good for the portfolio 📈📈🤣😂
Jesus, America is due for a correction. Their workers are so poor they think 5k = hitting it big.
Is it really risking it all though?  400 options at $0.50 means you spent, what, $2,000 ?

Edit: nvm. Your link to 6 explained it. Thanks!
Well, qcom is everywhere. But don’t you think the stock ran too hot? How high can it climb?
For the life of me, I need to better understand options. From what I see, this guy bought 400 contracts at .50 each, so a total of $20K spent. Better stick to comm shares and warrants/units.
so giants are not going to make the playoffs

SQ is great. I just enjoy having the other holdings included.
"If the SPAC finds a suitable company, then the two will merge. The combined entity then typically takes the name of the operating business, often changing its ticker symbol to reflect the new name."

Its not a whole new IPO dummy, just the ticker symbol changes. That news is from December 17th and STIC was listed on December 18th. Stop tryna scare me out my boots.

I wonder if Cathy started an army of shillers to help her incite call buying to gamma spike her ETFs to protect her against the hostile take over, as cathie’s leadership is now considered perhaps more important to the board than the extra money from the people attempting takeover. I.e. without Cathy, ark funds go down, not in best interest for shareholders for takeover.

give me your next 5 year holdings and explain why in a sentence

TSLA, because it’s shaping to be the “apple” of cars and software as a service, will inevitably be mar’s economy, and because elon musk himself

CRSPR, because it’s shaping to be a “create your avatar” but on the human race

ROKU, because it mixes hardware and software upgradability, takes advantage of the psychological aspects of entertainment on-demand, and the economy of scale is massive

Z, because the economy of scale via internet, ease of buying/selling homes quicker than usual and network effects, it’s literally like the grand exchange in runescape but with houses

PLTR, simply because of Pascal’s wager.

Incredible video. Is the timing of this post on wsb foreshadowing what is to come short term? Other trending post is about bears coming out of hibernation. If people made insane money going up on tesla, and we know you can make much more on the way down... does the downfall of things like tesla cause the common man to become filthy rich?

🔱eekend 🅿️ow‼️ keeps surging upwards. This week is setting up to be legendary.
Interactive Brokers, Tradestation Global (IB Introducer) or Saxo Bank. That's pretty much all your options unless you wanna go offshore with brokers like Tradezero. Or you could use CFD brokers but you won't have  US options. Netherlands have Lynx and Germany have Trader Republic. They are also introducing brokers to IB but with higher commission but no inactivity fee. What country are you from? IB will most likely be the cheapest. Saxo has awesome research and platform but are quite expensive.

“Both types of gains qualify as an “eligible gain” for the QOZF deferral. Short-term capital gains are held for one year or less. Long-term capital gains are held for more than one year. A QOZF allows investors to defer the gains tax from the sale of stocks, bonds, business sales, real estate, and various other assets.”
Saw uber drop to 15$ in april and assumed I could make money off of it. Downloaded robinhood, put in a few thousand and made some money here and there. Eventually put 14k in total since then and am up 110% or so since. Was up 300% until early sept :-\\
Those are called jobs
I love selling options to some of you retards.
Short term capital gains are taxed at your personal taxable rate based on income including the capital gain. 

So if you sold when that screenshot was taken and made $423,200 in gains. It automatically puts you in the 35% tax bracket without including your normal income. 

Basically, if you were completely unemployed in 2020 and made this sale, you would owe roughly $122,915.00 in taxes due. This number changes greatly depending on how much you make as yearly income. 

Now unfortunately for you, you cannot cross into the long term capital gains territory since expiry is april and you bought them after that. Long term capital gains rates kick in for holding something for 1 year or longer.

Basically, you are fucked on taxes no matter what. Rolling your position just pushes off your taxes and doesn't prevent you from paying on that gain. BECAUSE, when  you roll you effectively sell your position anyways, you trigger a taxable event. The gains are just immediately used to buy a new position. 

I would pull half profits now, set aside money for taxes in a safe stock that has consistent gains, or start writing covered puts and calls, and put the rest into something else. 

Then whenever you want next year, collect the second half and that tax bill falls in 2022. Do the same thing, do something safe with the amount you are using to pay taxes so you make some money while it's sitting around, like a strong dividend stock. 

The cash you have here isn't retire forever money, but it is setup your life to make it easy for the rest of it money. A 300k cash infusion is huge. Hell you could just dump 200k into a mutual fund and then fuck around with 100k, lose it all to post on WSB for karma, and still have the 200k + gains from not pissing it all away.
I'm not holding any puts, but the fact that's the only circumstance you can think of for seeing the obvious does show me you're lack of uh, comprehension however.

You know things happen for more than one reason. I know that's crazy to believe but...
Google is your friend. Go type in "VW Squeeze 2008." And read up. Or in general "Short Squeeze." If you've got questions afterwards, im happy to help.

But I would also read a couple other articles on them to help cement it in your brain. What really helped me was actually trying it out and using my own money. Just don’t be dumb like me and spend a lot on your first spread; spend a hundred or so on a cheap spread and see how it goes. It’s recommended not to hold to expiration as a single leg can be assigned and fuck you over. Good luck soldier.

People buy deep ITM calls because it has similar leverage to buying 100 shares without having the money for 100 shares. The delta (how much the value of the option changes as the value of the underlying changes) tend to be very high. So a call a year or two out for example with have a delta close to 1.
I am profitable

They can try, but what happens if we push this up to $24+ in the next week or so? Their put position becomes worthless. 

In order for them to make money on that trade, it needs to go down back towards $16 and fast enough to avoid theta/IV crush, and I see a low chance of that happening. Mainstream media is starting to pick up on this as well and we still have a lot of retail money that's untapped.

It’s rare to want to exercise. Options have two variables in their value, intrinsic value and extrinsic value. Intrinsic is the value between the strike and current price (so a 10 call when the stock is at 20 has $10 of intrinsic value). The extrinsic value is the time value. So if the above option is worth a premium of $15, the extrinsic value is $5 (total value - intrinsic value = extrinsic value).

So if you can exercise and make $10 per share, or sell the option at $15 per share, which is better? Exercise get you ONLY the intrinsic value, and loses you any extrinsic value.
Nice play. What's your target?

This is a fact. I could see holding a GME or other entertainment though the holiday resurgence. If it lasts past April you've got a whole year to figure the taxes out.

Nio 1/15/21 $50c. Dropped a couple bucks after the baba news making it a good time to buy. Nio day is Jan 9th. Revealing new sedan and their new battery that supposedly has further range than tsla. Stock will push beyond $50.

They are worth 423K. This is the difference between the $10 exercise price (the price each contract allows OP to buy 100 shares) and the current price of GME + a premium that is a multiple of the implied future vol and the time remaining to expiration. (simplified)

“I think markets have basically priced in $2 trillion in stimulus, and obviously we’re not getting that with the $900 billion relief bill, but we know that Janet Yellen and Joe Biden are coming into office, and we know that there’s even a possibility that Democrats are going to take control of the Senate, which all points to more stimulus, which all points to down dollar, which all points to more ability for asset prices to increase,” Frances Newton Stacy, Optimal Capital director of strategy,told Yahoo Finance on Thursday.“So markets are quite literally shrugging this off.”

Posting in WSB and SecurityAnalysis choose your side you cant have both.
You’re not “lucky” if you didn’t lose this year. S&P is up 15%.  If you lost money this year that means you significantly underperformed not only the S&P but also underperformed all the pussies at r/investing.  If you lost money this year, especially considering the run we’ve had since March, you are really, really, really bad at this and should stop trying.  If you can’t win in a market like this, you should never try to manage your money yourself and if you want to invest buy a target fund. I guess the advice from the investing folks is actually great advice if you’re that bad at this.
My God
Remind me to never mention stocks/options/investing to anyone outside of WSB ever again.

>Peter Garber blames the general public for the price increases. He  reckons that an outbreak of bubonic plague in Amsterdam made people less  risk-averse. Dutch city-dwellers knew that each day could be their  last—so did not mind indulging in a little speculation. And because  gambling was illegal, contracts were unenforceable. **If traders misjudged  the market, they could just run off without paying**.

My takeaway: Airbnb won’t happen again, underwriters like Goldman Sachs won’t be able to get their cut on direct listings which will cut into their profit margins, and spacs will continue to stay strong, although likely with lower listing volumes as more companies go the direct IPO route.

$BFT
Do it. I sell houses in Austin to fund my WSB decisions
The SPAC went public at $20 instead of the traditional $10 for a chamath spac, for example.

So the $26 price today is equivalent to $13 on a traditional spac. 

The NAV of the spac, or net asset value is $20. Meaning that PSTH is just a pile of cash worth $20 per share. If the deal fails to happen (it won’t because of the incentive structure), the shares are worth $20 each at minimum and you would just redeem them for that price. This is why the downside is capped.

The warrants are available for purchase now yes. When the merger goes through and you stick with the common stock through the merger you get the option to buy 2 additional shares at a price of $23 for every 9 commons you own. Think of it as dragging your average price down significantly (assuming your common avg is above $23, which it is for a lot of people since the stock hasn’t been at $23 in months).

Can someone clarify the warrants? This post implies that if you are a shareholder of 9 common shares then you automatically get 2 warrants as well, but it looks like the warrants are listed separately under PSTH.WS and available to buy. 

Can you buy warrants only but you also get the 2/9ths for each common share you own? 

Do you just have to own the common shares pre-merger to get the warrants? What’s the cutoff.

That's what everyone was telling me about Rite Aid a couple years ago and I was like that's stupid, they're obviously not gonna go bankrupt, they can probably just leverage their brand and get government help indefinitely.

I was right, they did not go bankrupt. Years later, they finally started climbing out of the hole but after all the reverse stock splits and stuff I lost track of whether I actually ended up making any gains and I was just glad to get out of the position without total fuk.
^ this is correct. You *declare* it so that you can take out another loan in a few years and do it again. OP have you asked any friends if you can leverage their assets? If they are good fiends they will let you.

I agree it is a solid bet.  The IV on the options is a little too high for my taste, but I like the shares.

To be fair, the bear case is easy to make if you don’t dig below the surface.  GME lost a lot of money last year and it’s a mall retailer.  It doesn’t take too much digging to see the balance sheet is solid, the low sales to enterprise value ratio, there’s a turn around plan, the e-commerce was so bad that it’s easy to improve, they have a ton of data that is likely undervalued, the dawn of the console cycle, and RC crossing the 10% threshold.  The MOASS is just a bonus lottery ticket that could pay off big.
Large dark pool dump at 49 with buying at low 40’s. There’s pressure on both sides might range for a while. Probably be some serious profit taking if nio day sends it flying again.

Cramer’s portfolio is widely known to underperform SPY.  The reason it seems like he wins is because he retroactively claims credit for his good calls, but buries his bad calls under the rug.  Which is similar to what WSB does.

Inverse Cramer wouldn’t be good, because Cramer does get a positive return on his charitable trust.  The winning trade here would be a highly leveraged spread between Cramer’s portfolio and SPY.  Or better yet, a spread between ARKK and Cramer’s boomer portfolio.
2021 is the year for RKT, i hope lol

The announcement you saw may not have a huge impact right away, but AWS is already competing in this space with the Chime SDK. Healthcare providers are pivoting to create their own version of this technology with programmable video. Different from the TDOC packaged solution but solves the same problem. 

TwIlio is the leader rn but AWS Chime SDK is gaining momentum. MFST and Zoom announced their own version of this too, so I expect their MOAT will continue to narrow. 

That being said it only proves market validation for TDOC and should be a solid bet for this year

I love my life. That love and joy just doesn’t come from money anymore. It absolutely did for a while. For most people I’ve met in finance and tech, money drives their happiness... until it doesn’t. Then it’s time to address the reasons why you wanted money in the first place. For the lucky, they get some cash and realize they had a whole lotta issues they weren’t addressing. The unlucky ones never address those issues and die from whippets and candles (founder of Zappos) rarely have I found someone so driven by money that didn’t end up having deep issues from their childhood driving that greed. Just my experience. Good luck y’all!

I guess you can include yourself. The main characteristic of a short squeeze is a reduction in short interest as prices spike higher.. So far we've only seen the latter. Prices moving higher is a prerequisite, but can happen weather or not there is an actual squeeze. Until shorts have actually paid to cover, a squeeze there has been not.

Yes, it's probably very cheap and could be an easy 10-bagger. I'd go all in, and sell half when it triples, and the rest when it goes 1000%.

Holy shit. Please tell me you're selling on Monday. That's a better return than you could ever have hoped for and holding on for longer in hopes of an even bigger return has a very strong potential of crashing.

Yea I don’t disagree with you at all. These could options could very well print easily. But the difference here is the scale AWS, MFST, ZOOM can offer for better pricing. 

The biggest advantage AWS and MFST offer may be the ability to extend into other cloud services like transcription, translation and other AI/ML tools already available. Usually customers need to pay exorbitant fees for these features from 3rd party services. Twilio has some of these capabilities too but not to the extent of these other giants.

Jokes aside - hope you get good therapy (on that money just get the hottest therapist) You can't control what happened to you but you sure can choose what it will ultimately mean to you. It's just neurons in the brain, don't let the asshole take more than what he already took.
I only know this and I am quite certain of it: to help speed up the short squeeze, you must buy GME in cash accounts and you must not buy it in margin accounts. 

If you buy in cash accounts, such as IRA accounts, you effectively remove the shares from the available to short pool. Net effect of this could be seen on borrowing rates. Borrowing rates start to move up. If borrowing rates are not moving up, either there are pumpers that keep posting and unloading shares to exit profitable long positions or buyers keep buying on margin while short traders keep averaging up at the same rate because shares are still not yo expensive to borrow
Great depression? The economy doesn't equal the market. As for the big boys, they don't care about us but they care about siphoning our money and they have a tool to do that with the market which they manipulate and control. 

We're in a global pandemic but the market is still at ATHs. And did you not see how quickly the March crash recovered? We're in a different time now. The economy could go in the toilet and the market can still just keep mooning. 

Ever since QE and 0% interest rates, we entered a new type of market where companies can have 1000+ PE ratios and still go up.

I say we burn it to the ground!!!!
Doesn’t surprise me too much, actually. I just don’t think it’s reasonable to hold an entire class of a society individually accountable for their situation, as if they all can just up a change it, when the solicitation of the working class and ‘somebody is going to get shit on’ mindset is built into the system. Not when there are a few easy changes that could be made to relieve their burden. I find myself at odds with the conservative mindset that blaming people takes precedence over thinking about ways to improve the system. Society is always moving forward. Progressives have been winning for thousands of years, it won’t stop now.

That would be the “bullish” scenario (this market goes up on anything semi positive) since then Congress can overwrite veto. The worst case scenario is if he sits on the bill and waits for current Congress session to end (Jan 3rd) which would automatically veto any non enacted bills and therefore a new stimulus and omnibus bill would have to be presented and approved by the new congress

When im up over 100% in my first year of (swing) Trading. Was talking stocks over christmas with some older folks, and they all said I was extremely lucky with my gains and picks. I told them I only use two buttons on ameritrade. Buy and flatten. Their expression was priceless.

So they asked me what they should drop a few grand on. Several of them being war veterans. So I told them PLTR. And they loved it because of the government contracts. So I guess I convinced a few people to hop on to that for long term investment. Not enough to be market makers/movers. But hype across another two generations.

None of them gave a fuck about current price. They are all thinking 5 years out from now.
Guhhhh
It has an arc, enjoy the ride
I’m scared to know what I owe
He probably won't veto it at all, because it would give Congress a chance to override him. Sitting on it is way more effective

Ive always just used turbo tax but have had to pay for a more advanced version that allows for the input of brokerage info. 
Unless they’ve changed it, the free version doesn’t include it.
again as i said the risk here is that you underperform the market and miss out on gains elsewhere. it could take years for a SPAC to announce a target and it could theoretically stay between 10-11 for a long time before any movement happens. And as you may have seen in march, SPACs can very well go sub $10. You‘re not guaranteed to get back the $10 at anytime, only when the SPAC has stopped looking for an acquisition target. So you could also baghold for a long time.
*the cycle continues*
If papa Elon doesn’t see this I’ll be extremely disappointed
So the options are worth the 423k? Or is that the value of the stock that you would have if you exercised? 

And are ITM call options very liquid? I’m not sure I see why someone would buy an ITM call

As someone who works in this space I think this is a good bet. That being said just be aware that AWS is starting to penetrate this market with the Chime SDK. 

Microsoft recently released a BETA of a video SDK and Zoom is planning to release a fully customizable SDK soon. I would expect Google to announce something soon too. 

If anything this proves market validation for Twilio who has been leading in this space, but now they will have to start competing with some of the other giants.

A median trader will do worse active trading than long term investing. Think about it, average return is approximately what you get from ETF, everything else is zero sum and your counterparty is a better informed professional. That said, I do trade because I enjoy gambling as a form of entertainment (and so far made big returns.. yay gambling)!
Apply for college, get 25k in student loans, use that money to pay off THIS loan, then hope that the dems aren’t lying when they say they’re going to forgive a bunch of student loan debt.

I'd love another March tbh. The trick is to buy puts as the market goes down and then buy calls as the market goes back up.
Just gamble more money on the games and they will become instantly more exciting
What if i told you I agree with everything you just said.  We are closer in thought then you think.

But when I was young and broke i didnt live beyond my means and pile up debt, and always loaded up my 401k and bought stocks. Pay yourself first.

I didn’t make over 50k until i was 31 (six years ago) Im not normal though- there are studies that show poor people will live beyond their means,  buy name brand instead of generic.

Where we disagree is i believe it is the fault of the individual-  but i also believe in the total depravity of man.

You can deduct up to 3k of capital loss against ordinary income if married and filing jointly, half that if single or filing separately. If you have any short term unrealized gains, you can realize some against the loss so you don't owe tax on them. Check if you have wash sale, they don't count toward the deduction.
Just call 911 and tell them.
Nah, always have 0 buying power.  I use MSFT as a base currency and hold my gambling money in shares for when I need a play.  Buying power never goes up msft does

IIPR is actually a good call. Got in at $80 and been steady since. I think some 90%+ of their leases are signed for 16 years. And a 6% dividend. 
Only going to get higher

Edit : IIPR now owns 61 properties located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. 99.2% of these properties are leased with a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately 16.0 years.

You’re basically trying to squeeze the marrow from the bones of a carcass now upside is much likelier than downside as the main cause for downside is the CCP boogeyman. Many Chinese hold BABA in their pensions and this isn’t about ruining a company out of spite the way ant financial was structured was actually exposing the economy to systemic risk. They were loaning people money without securing the loans which could have led to rifts in the banking system.

Shorts are always on the prowl to suppress price action, they usually cover pre market and short at open. I would wait out the first 15-20 min after open to see if they try to drive price down before deciding to buy

I had a small position at 15 before it plummeted and held on for dear life. Then watched it go to 19 and sold last week. Considering getting back in tmr if the open isn’t bananas. Really liking the squeeze chances here. It could really go to $40, which doesn’t even make sense but it’s a fitting way to end the year 2020.

I don't know what universe you're living in, but in mine, blockbuster bought netflix and took over the streaming market. I didn't travel through time and space to deal with scrubs like you, I came to invest in the next GME changer.
Sounds bullish.
I slowly add money weekly to invest. I wanna avoid this!
I’m holding, 1 because it’d be paying 36-38% tax but also I bought stocks I want to keep, thinking it’s the once in a life time to buy those at a lower price. I might kick myself later when the bubble pops but maybe 20 years will be good to me.. maybe (that’s the game right)

Again. It’s not just a location service. It’s not comparable to google maps. If you think it is it’s because you have no idea what they actually do. 

It’s like saying why invest in GRWG when you can just buy supplies at Home Depot

They provide a lot of support to dispensaries which they get paid for. If you guys don’t wanna invest in a company that’s been profitable 12 years straight that’s on you. $12 is a cheap risk I’m willing to take.
“You have to accept being second place always, my kids come first”

Lol yeah sure dude, you realize that printing money isn’t some useless corrupt thing that does harm to the economy right? You realize that if we didn’t inject money into the financial system we’d be in a far worse place right now, right? You probably don’t realize that though because you’re so infatuated with the idea that the big banks are out to get you and that keeping the economy stable is bad.

Good luck to your super elite crypto economic system when mining is no longer profitable, or literally anything bad happens to the general economy.

Finding one particularly well performing stock over the past couple months and bragging about how you know how to make money while shilling it at ATH and while also calling the ticker the “code” is one of the reasons Robinhood gets a bad rep for making trading too easy to access, she has no fucking clue what she’s doing. She just got lucky and thinks she has the system beat, even worse she’s bringing more inexperienced traders in to lose their money. Just wait until she finds options lol, that’ll give her the wake up call she needs.

"11.**Hypothecation.** Within the limitations imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations, all securities now or hereafter held by Robinhood, or carried by Robinhood in any account for the Customer (either individually or jointly with others), or deposited to secure same, may from time to time, without any notice, be carried in its general loans and may be pledged, repledged, hypothecated or re- hypothecated, separately or in common with other securities for the sum due to Robinhood thereon or for a greater sum and without retaining in its possession or control for delivery a like amount of similar securities. The IRS requires broker dealers to treat dividend payments on loaned securities positions as payments received in lieu of dividends for 1099 tax reporting purposes.

No, it’s caterpillar. I have a condition. MSFT is a way better long term hold.

Is there a specific reason you chose 1/15 $29c?  Like you only have $215 or you want to buy 10 for 2150?  Not being an ass, I just think it might be more beneficial to push the date out a little more and a little higher in price. RH shows earnings date of 3/15, but it’s probably more around 2/11, according to NASDAQ.com. 

I’m not saying I don’t think it’ll hit $29 by then, but I just think a further out date like 05/21 would be better. You’ll get live demo day on 1/26, a possible earnings pump, but you also have the possible lock-up period dump. Which I believe would be followed by an institutional pump. 

I’m currently in 2/19 $20c, 5/21 $40c, 11/19 $40c, and 73 shares.
I’ll buy that shit up if there is anything but a gap up.

It is rare for people in this sub to have an investing strategy which explains why it is so rare for people to have significant returns consistently while trading options. Out of the 100 different tickers I might look at in a day, I might only find 2 or 3 options worth buying based on price and Greeks. Even then I might not buy it just based on flow or support/resistance levels. In short, success is made by the investment you make. Some people think about the money invested, while others think of the time invested. You can make it big with a couple grand if you do enough research and make the right investment decisions.

Either or. Options are designed to be a form of insurance. If I have 400k I can exercise my calls to trade in for 40k shares or I can sell for my profit

That's risk/return perspective. From the point of getting a safer return, as opposed to stay in cash, getting into a $10 SPAC is the most relative safe play, specially considering the hype surrounding them. Since your getting ur $10 back, what's the risk here?

Can’t lose when you haven’t invested!
Definitely if it were that easy. 

I’d charge friends and family a fee and invest their cash though not sure how well they’d cope with potentially loosing money. Maybe I wouldn’t let family and friends invest but I’d definitely do it - would be interesting to see how well I’d do relative to other funds.

My only problem is idm loosing my own money but I hate loosing other people’s money

TOP THE SPORK
That's not the story I remember him telling about it. As I recall the bank called his note when they realized how much they lender someone in their twenties in the wake of the savings and loan crisis. He had a net worth over 1 million and the properties were worth more than he owed but because the bank called the loans he couldn't sell them in time to match the call. But if you can find the source of him saying something different I'd appreciate the correction. 

With regard to his advice: he has to give generic advice that millions can follow. That means dumbed down investing. I don't follow his investing advice for the same reasons you cite but he can't tell everyone something different, that's not scalable. He also knows most people aren't disciplined enough to over pay on a 30 year, so he gives generic advice on 15's. His stance on credit cards also doesn't make sense financially but he knows people won't always pay them off at the end of the month. His advice is watered down personal finance which is actually very effective overall. If the average Joe follows his advice they will succeed, just not at the level someone like you and I would because we understand somewhat more advanced investing principles.
Thanks a lot for the info bro. I found this post from your post on r/psth. Gonna give you a follow

Apple never made a phone pre 2006, the competition had 30 years of R&d  billions of dollars, blackberry was literally one of the biggest tech companies in the world and apple turned them into a penny stock, and made them get out of the phone market. That’s literally the most insane statement I’ve ever heard in my life.

Apple wasn’t even in the phone business, so to say it had no competition is completely stupid. 
The fact is apple made a better product and destroyed the competition. So yes it had competition it just destroyed it. 

I can build an ev in my garage, in fact I built a a electric quad for my son. Building a phone? Not so easy. 

As an engineer saying Ev’s are harder to make is another ridiculous statement. We had electric cars 20 years ago, making a phone is way harder, they teach you in highschool how to hook a motor up and propel a device. Now try to make a iPhone? 

Apples coming and it’s coming hard, apple is Tesla’s Achilles heel.

Tesla barely made 200
Million, apple made 60
Billion . It has enough cash to take every single one of Tesla’s workers and put them on payroll for 600 years. The biggest company in the world is coming for Tesla goodluck.

Ideally you’ll get Margin called and/or your broker will close positions for you but if your position moves against you too quickly...say a stock that you shorted triples overnight then your broker can’t close your position fast enough and you could have a negative balance.

Musk joined Tesla in 2004, one year after it was formed and 16 years before it joined the S&P500. He was appointed Chairman of the Board that same year and became CEO as well in 2008. Tesla and Musk are inextricably linked and have been for a long time.  In summary, you are a moron.

How poor do you think people are? Most subscribers are not single guys with nothing but time on their hands.

When you have a family and you subscribe to something, you share the login with your friends, parents, siblings, or kids, and, sometimes extended family, you don't just cancel it rejoined every month or two.

The reason the subscription model works is that very few people sub and cancel selectively. They cancel when they are dissatisfied with the service.

Netflix is getting stale for a lot of people, they aren't canceling, because they remember all the good things they've watched fondly, but people in general are excited about adding a streaming service, Disney plus got a huge bump, and now that people understand what HBO is and that it doesn't just have HBO content but a lot of other content, people are really excited about it.

This lunch just in time for everyone to talk about how awesome it is around the family Christmas and it is cheap enough that people can get it on a whim.

Date?
If you buy commons tomorrow, for example, and hold them through the merger (in other words, you say yes to keeping the stock instead of cashing at NAV level of $20), then you are awarded 2/9 of a warrant for every one common you own, with an exercise price of $23.

Practically this means that for every 9 commons you own, you can then buy 2 more commons for $23 (regardless of the stock price at that time, it could be $150, for example, but most people are saying $75-100 target on LOI).

Given what happened with ABNB, the $150 number is not outlandish, depending on target (all options are amazing). ABNB originally set up for a $45 offering and opened at $160....

These have low IV and will be quick movers when the underlying trends upward. Easy 100% or more if we have a bull market this week. However there’s a lot of uncertainty in many places which could impact that.

With a deep ITM option a good 70% to 80% of the value can be intrinsic, even on super high IV stocks. If you’re buying a leap it means you’re preparing to potentially hold it for a long time and you expect upward movement but you might not expect it to happen quickly, but more steadily over a long time.

If you buy deep OTM leap on high IV, you’ll need a TSLA like growth in the underlying to make a profit. If the stock price does move slowly, the value of your options is going to bleed steadily from time and IV decay.

Also, if you own ITM leaps, you can sell shorter term OTM calls weekly or monthly and lower the cost basis of your leaps.

Having said all that, if there is a huge movement over time in the underlying, you’ll get higher gains with OTM, but the movement does need to be a lot. You can price out scenarios with an options calculator.

One calculation is wrong but you also calculated it wrong, retard.

>Short % of Shares Outstanding = Shares Short ÷  Shares Outstanding  
Short % of Shares Outstanding = 68.13M ÷ 69.75M = 97.68%  
>  
>Short % of Float =  Shares Short ÷ Float  
Short % of Float = 68.13M ÷ 48.15M = 141.50%

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp)

It's not so much that the percentage is off, it's that anything 50%+ is significant, and especially when *Shares Short > Float* (141.50%). It means there will not be enough shares to cover the shorts, which will drive prices up when no one wants to sell and they need to buy to cover.

As another example, PTON was 50% short on 02/28/2020, and if they didn't cover during the March lockdown lows, they got fucked.
No way. Too much reporting, too many laws.

This is the confirmation bias I expected to receive. Thanks man
My mom actually gave us each cash to put into Robinhood instead of actual gifts this year. I vastly prefer it to junk I may use once or twice before forgetting about. The best thing about tendies is that, assuming you chose stonks that only go up, they’re the gift that keeps on giving because you can constantly reinvest them. 

My “trading” has definitely consumed a lot of my time, and seeing big green dildos does bring me joy. It might be a problem except it has actually been helping to keep me on a somewhat normal routine. Although my bedtime has not improved significantly, I sure don’t sleep past 9 AM anymore and that counts for something. 

This has been a tough few months for me, not even considering the pandemic. So, having something to keep my mind occupied and out of the dark places has been, in my opinion, overall good. 

I have at times let my day job and school suffer at the expense of possible tendie making, so it’s not all rainbows and butterflies, but I still think it’s been overall positive. I’ve learned a great deal in the past few months of “trading.” So even if I lost it all tomorrow, I feel that I would come out on top.

Plus, did any of us really ever enjoy the small things in that way? It’s a different feeling altogether, in my opinion.
Fuck yes !!

That sucks. My BABA shares I bought at their ATH back in April @214 and then they went down to 185 and then up to 319 and then I bought Jan 2022 400c leaps when it sunk to 290. That's down about 80%. I just got into CRM with Jan 2022 260c when it was at 230 so I'm about even on that.

PSTH.U was the original unit. You can’t buy it anymore cause it already split so I don’t know what you’re talking about. If you have common shares at the moment (PSTH) you will receive at least 2 warrants exercisable at $23 for every 9 shares you hold through the merger. It’s not really hard to understand. This is all in addition to PSTH.WT which is available now for $9.40.

A more serious approach, start living like a broke 20 year old. Reduce your rent if applicable, i.e. get room mate, live on a humble diet, don't go out, no extra spending at all. If needed attempt to get second job or some passive income - even if this means selling some of you stuff. And lastly, most importantly, pay this off asap. the long term payments will hinder all future opportunity of establishing wealth. A personal loan will bubble up over the long run and 25 k can spiral into 30+ in a few years d pending on APR. Whatever it is takes pay this off in 1-2 years and you'll be ok. 
Now sit down, breathe, and pull up dem bootstraps son. It's going to suck.

What would j pow do
So WHAT is the catalyst here?

Cohen taking over is not the catalyst. That's the consequence if the board doesn't do what he wants. If the board does what he wants a takeover will never happen.

The funds are shorting GME because they don't believe it will be profitable or grow in the medium/long-term. What is it that will drive GME to growth. Can you elaborate on what exactly is their gameplan for growth and how credible it is? That's the catalyst. An anticipated console cycle boost in Q4 earnings - which the shorts are fully aware of - isn't going to cut it if the rest of the year the business dives and dwindles.

You are all focusing on Cohen taking over and the shorts getting squeezed, but I don't see what is going to trigger that. Xmas consoles sales won't cut it. They need to turn around the business. If I could be convinced on that then I'd get in as well.

Well Blue Heroins are pretty amazing birds......Going to have to find out what all this strike, call, option stuff is about!
I’m not buying the short squeeze will cause price to go to at least $16/18. That’s really lowballing it. If you remove all of the shares shorted, the current price of GME should be around $47.

As for your hedge, once you are making 20% every other day on some ITM SPY call debit spreads with an account at $5,000, it makes sense to take literally 1 spread's profit of $1,000 and buy an OTM put expiring in a few months. You'd recover the cost of the put within a few days, and you can pick up again with some protection behind you. I tried to encourage the dude to buy a hedge when he had $20,000 and was making $4k every m/w/f, but he refused and lost most of the loot. Gotta hedge with this strategy.
The spac turning into GNOG this week, it’s still very cheap and it’s heading towards $50-$100 in 2021

Has less to do with literacy and more to do with perspective. What do you consider long term? People always say “stocks only go up” for a reason... even if you bought at the peaks of 07’ youd still be making a killing now. It’s not always about simply making money, but making the most money based on time(outperforming the market). As a swing trader and dividend investor, I would say we have different investing perspectives. Also, options are definitely more about timing, and can lose significants amount of money while the stock is moving in the direction of your option... unless you haven’t learned about IV and the Greeks yet.
Agreed. Was lucky enough to catch a live taping in 09. Interacts a lot with the audience between segments. Great guy.

If the mother of all bubbles burst, then it'll be the end of stock market and there's just too much money to be made for the big boys to allow that to happen.

Nah, I’ve noticed a pretty drastic shift in comments and content that started a few months ago
New rules. Send me your music and I will get you laid. Only guys and gay mods allowed.
Just wondering how far it can go, amazon of China...just seems like eventually there will be a rebound and recovery. Going to keep rolling out this contract and adding more if it dips.
To me it boils down to a couple big things. Firstly obscene government spending, namely needless wars and bloated defense budget (I live in the defense world and the spending habits are grotesque, there’s no efficiency like in the private world). And the consumer debt fueled economy. Profitability of most companies is basically underwritten by huge banks because they prop up the consumer. Dozens of millions, if not a hundred million people, live beyond their means in America. When that many people subscribe to a life of debt or ‘on the brink of debt,’ is it really the fault of each individual, or is there something wrong with the system? People like you buy Netflix, Amazon and Disney stock and then blame poor people for not living within their means. You should be buying Netflix, Amazon and Disney puts if you really think the bottom 1/3 of America should be more responsible with their money. The working class literally prop up your stock market gains by doing the exact thing you’re blaming them for being poor by doing. You can’t have your cake and eat it too. Consumer debt fueled corporate euphoria needs a reality check, just like real estate euphoria did before. But JPOW is basically providing unlimited liquidity insurance to the corporations that underwrite retail profitability, meaning we’re in an FDIC insured feedback loop. The result? Companies don’t get punished when they profit off lower class America living beyond their means, the cycle continues. Americans won’t stop buying things because it’s what capitalists want. You contradict yourself when you say it’s their problem for being poor because they buy things- it’s literally what props you up.

Iv actually found a way around reporting to the SEC. In short only one company would have to report to the SEC and it would be a collective data from the public’s (private hedge fund)

I'm right though. I don't get how you dipshits just pretend human psychology doesn't exist. You literally have to use human psychological pitfalls to delude yourself about their power. It's enragingly ironic and stupid. Psychology is powerful whether you like it or not, people are often stuck in behavioral patterns that aren't their fault, that's life and you should really grow up and accept it. Don't use holding people responsible for themselves as an excuse to refuse to take any responsibility for the impact people can have on each other.
Tesla is valued as is because of their capabilities. Data maybe accounts for 1% of the equation. 

Apple can collect phone data and computer data easily. That's different from the real world driving data that Tesla collects daily. There are more than one million Tesla cars on the street each equipped with 9 video cameras and other sensors.

ICLN leaps... or FDs.
Funnily enough your analysis is completely backwards. BABA LEAPs are fucked as IV% is in the top 97th percentile. You buy LEAPs at the lowest IV possible as LEAPs are way more exposed to Vega. Weeklies in High IV at least give the chance for a major gain if you guess directionally the right way. 

Overall the best move would be to pick up shares of BABA as they aren't affected by vega/theta while still offering the inevitable bounceback gain. Second best move IMO would be selling atm puts 45 dte. Third best move would be selling way otm short term calls.
Examples?

Personally no. There's a lot of legal issues surrounding hedge fund management and reporting to SEC every year. Hedge funds cant advertise to the general public to take their money and have all sorts of laws governing what they can/cant do.

Hey OP, I'm 25 and used to trade as early as 07. I used to own over 5k shares of AMD when it was sub 3 a share and rode it to 13 where I sold. I got back in recently with the swing from 50 to 100. I was deep in a hole in march of this year tho with a shit tier pot company and getting vix puts too soon then it zeroed me out. I invested 5k in April and doubled. Invested another 5k and doubled again. total portfolio at 30k. I just invested another 15k and I've nearly cracked 50k Ive played a lot of TQQQ, FB, TWTR, SPOT, CRSP, F, ICLN, PSTH, THCB, AAPL, AMD, UBER, VIAC. I also fixed my moms account that got fucked to 2k from the same pot company. I was able to trade her way to 30k from that 2k. she currently holds 1000+ ICLN shares 1500+ Ford 500+ PSTH warrants 100+ shares 10+Dec 40c. My main holding looks similar with 1000+ PSTH 500+ warrants 500+ ICLN 20+ April21 25c 500+ F Jan22 7/9/10/12/15/17c 20+ each I have high hopes for green energy in 2021, Electric cars and I think ford, especially as the first mover of the legacy car brands, will try and set as many benchmarks as it can. Might move to apple as we close in on 2024. PSTH is my largest investment as of today and I believe in the management and backers. It will be the 10 bagger I've been looking for I know it. If I didn't trickle in my cash i'd be over 100k by now
The atrocity of another short week

EV market is different in many ways. First, this is an AI competition. It's a thousand times harder than phones. Tesla solved it. Apple I don't know, I don't think they solved it, otherwise the head of the project would be promoted instead of retiring. Second, I wouldn't assume Apple or any other company can beat Tesla's production. Elon thinks nobody else can.

Tesla has everything in place. People assume Apple did well with phone will do well against Tesla, I think that's a mistake. We each have our own views, we will see this unfold in the next 10 years.

As of frightened and emotionally invested - No and No.

At some point Tesla will produce phones and computers. That should be a real concern for Apple.
Those were the days fam.

Probably because more old people vote than young people and the thinking is young = inexperienced.
Crash = buying opportunity, so have enough available cash to get in and ride the recovery. If you think a crash is coming you can hedge with gold, etc.

Thanks for that. That makes sense compared to what has always been proclaimed by doomsayers saying hyperinflation is always coming. Money velocity matters more than money supply. Rich get richer I suppose.
They love Mitch. He has 100% incumbency and can’t lose. Gop will blame Democrats for not compromising or aka not bowing down to Mitch’s positions which are not middle of the road america. Gop fundraises off of this and don’t have to propose any solutions except be anti whatever the Democrats are talking about
Dude i found this on twitter, do you think that i research every famous person family tree. Even Chamath himself is joking why are you so mad...
His advice helps a lot of people, and I respect that immensely. My parents grew up in poorer households and were bad with money in their 20s, but Dave Ramsey’s program provided them with the tools and knowledge to pay down their excessive credit card debt and become financially literate and liberated. My parent’s being open and honest about that whole situation is what got me fascinated with money and finances, and is the reason I was ready to start investing the morning of my 18th birthday.

And now I’m YOLOing my whole portfolio on $MT calls.

BABA gonna fuck a lot of you. It's gonna be huge one day... but that day probably isn't soon. There is waaay too much uncertainty these days. Leaps are definitely gonna print, but weeklies aren't the move. I still think it hits 200 before it actually recovers. Might bump 10 or 20 here and there, but until it shows consistent growth you're playing with fire. Gyna does what Gyna wants.

For everything you just stated I could also say the US isn’t any better. 🤷🏻‍♀️
We can buy both models American or European options / warrants. If one wants to buy options, you have to stick to specific places. It’s easier to buy warrants.

Most warrants have the American model which means that you can sell any time. Just make sure to double check before buying.
Do you hate yourself because GME blew up without your money?

Ruined myself for liquor this holiday season.. been drinking nothing but Courvoisier, Remy Martin and fuckin' Henny.. so good.
I used to sell furniture in Oil Counties. Covid hit, oil tanked, I lost my job. Been out of a job for 9 months.

I started by putting 200 dollars on Ameritrade. Made meager gains. Uppped it to 1000, made 20%. Ended up putting my entire savings into that afterwards, sans the monthly bills. Made 100% return that month. Took out my initial and put that back into my savings to pay future bills.

I have eaten some losses this past year, but over all, im up more than 100% After what I put in the third time. Not quite 200% But my life is good for being what it is.

Current Position. All in on SRAC Warrants. Went in at 5 dollars the 23rd. Up 20% on that one. Feeling like a rampaging bull, and this will probably my first long. I tend to hold on to stocks for no more than a week, 0 experience in options. Usually selling my positions at 20% profit.

As much as I want to profit take on these warrants, im actually holding on to these until the Momentus (all puns intended) stops. And I got my finger over the flatten button.

Buy in EOD Monday
one thing to consider during a bull market, if you can afford it--leg into a debit spread by buying the call.  As the stock continues to move upwards, sell a call (to complete the spread) for a higher price than had you done it all at once.  I'm not going to do that with AMZN, as the risk is way too expensive for what I have, but I do that for sure with AAPL.
so the numbers will move again? like in the before times?
All bezos needs to do - announse 30 for 1 stock split - and Amzn  approaches Aapl market cap

Underrated comment
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone

This has been my bread and butter this year, mostly with AMZN.   You've got a blue chip like stock growing like it's a startup, and crushing high expectations, and still raising guidance.

Whenever it dipped below 3100, and hopefully near 3000, I'd open up a 50 point call spread ATM, or better, ITM.  Only on the monthlies, for an average of a 1:1 risk/reward.  Sometimes 6 weeks out, sometimes 3 months out.  I was shooting for the 1:1 risk/reward, and assuming that 3200 was a good base, so my spreads were never above 3150.   Did I lose some?  Yep.  Doesn't hurt much when the wins are consistent.  

Only on monthlies.  Let me repeat that (having been burned on weeklies) only on monthly expirations.
Pay off your student loans and think about this lesson.  Next time hopefully you won't have to pay tuition.

It could see some pullback for sure and I can't recommend short term plays, but I have a personal PT over 30 pre-merger and think it's honestly modest. Their competitors stand 0 chance with their current price models being 10x+ more costly. It's medtech that's affordable to even the poorer nations, clinically and hospital-oriented. It's not one of the SPACs without a product. Already gotten regulatory approval, already being used. I could literally type a collegiate essay on the reasons I love it.  

If you read through articles\interviews\just use google, astonishingly, about 2\3rd's of the world doesn't have access to ultrasounds or diagnostic imaging. BFLY let's anyone with a smartphone, along with their device, have access to it. I'm sure you can imagine how big the addressable market truly is based on that alone. This is already more effort than I was initially wanting to put into this post, but it makes me realize just how fucking bullish I am about it. Makes me want to put all of my thoughts and reasonings into one lengthy boring DD.

Just because you sit in your mothers basement playing video games all day doesn’t mean you follow the gaming industry closely. 

This isn’t just about digital sales. Its about rebranding and redesigning their current business model to allow their already well known brands to tap into a market that has extreme growth. 

Boomers and skeptics can’t seem to open their eyes to the fact that there are ways to make money in gaming beyond selling video games. 

With e-commerce god Cohen jumping on board to guide them to this digital promise land and the fact that over 90% of borrowed stocks are short positions, we’re in for a good time.

Its free.  See my comment above.  It's "Cash Management" which just means its not an account with Robinhood, but rather your money is essentially sold to banks all over the country in exchange for FDIC protection and a little bit of interest.  High net worth people have to do this frequently with their accounts and most banks offer a similar service.  The money is still yours and can be recalled at any time.

Why the 200 on the weekly though? According to what I'm seeing, price has never even touched the weekly 200. The 160 MA on the weekly however, has been touched 5 times. Price bounced almost exactly off of it each time.
Wow.  So when you're determining what to pledge for a wager, this is where you land?  Interesting.

Because (and I'm peaking to u/Sil5286 when I say that the shit-eating thing, while disgusting, does seem a slightly less extreme proposition then amputating your left nut would be.

Sounds like that was a logical thesis but the shorts got too far ahead of themselves. GME still has revenue coming in and a tremendous amount of cash on hand to the point that bankruptcy would still be years away at least.

So the book value of the company was way higher than the stock price. With two major console releases in Q4 you can bank on GME seeing solid revenues for the next 6-9 months as well.

Enter Ryan Cohen, Michael Burry and an army of retail investors putting pressure on the execs to make up for lost time in the online sales arena (better late than never). Microsoft soon inked a profit sharing deal on digital downloads bought on Game Stop sold devices.

Suddenly a "dying" brick and mortar company has a few lifelines to keep them afloat while they make a legitimate effort to evolve into an online company. Meanwhile many gamers still require physical disk purchases due to lagging internet speeds. 

Next generation console releases also ensure that that the resale market should continue booming into 2021. 

GME is now looking at multiple high revenue quarters on the horizon. And with the stock shorted to the tits you may find a lot of bears racing to get off the ride before they lose more money.

This is how I understand it anyway.
So biden is gonna have to do a jobs/infrastructure bill?

This sub just convinced me to get 500 shares of PSTH in retirement. Cool.

This is 100% real?
If you are the holder of record for the shares, you have voting right.  Just because a person have voting right, they do not necessarily bother to vote when a situation arise that call for votes.  
If you are the holder of record for the shares, you will be mailed/emailed of upcoming shareholders voting events and it’s due dates to submit your vote.

ARKG bought 6.06m shares a while ago and I thought they will go up over the next year. But yeah I don't know, saw it quite often here in WSB so maybe I shouldn't buy Leaps on it :D
Yes, and if you read the reports then you will see that the CCP has 0 problems with the payment processing of ANT but with lending, insurance etc.

I kind of do, although I think I left Jack in the Box early. I like following Cathie’s investments as well. Sometimes it pays to follow specific investors with a proven track of success. Cramer has become successful by screwing people over.
You know, if you wanted to throw money away on nothing, I would have been more than happy to take it from you! Baba has never hit above $320 and it sure as hell won’t do it in less than a year with the CCP suppressing it 😂
He said elsewhere he sold them all for $500k and put it back into NIO calls or something

If you want to stay in the market but need to pay tax, most large brokerages offer asset backed loans at reasonable interest (~4.5%). They just won’t let you use the money to buy investments due to regulations.

In the early days they were offering money market accounts paying like 2.5% APY but it wasn't FDIC insured, which was super sketchy.  Now they're using insured cash sweeps which basically means your money gets swept into accounts at places like Citibank.  Most banks actually do this and it's fine.

I don’t think so. Not nearly as much as buying a call or a put by itself. If you go to optionsprofitcalculator.com and compare a regular call with a spread you can see the difference 

But if you’re talking about the spread value jumping when there’s not much movement.. yeah I’ve noticed that with some of the more illiquid tickers. But it hasn’t been an issue for me with stuff like amazon and apple

March was great for me. Puts on everything. March 23rd hit and wiped all gains. Every last bit. DIAMONDS HANDS BABY!
Thanks.  Haven't gone full retard and traded options on margin, yet.  I was thinking about going all in on margin and going with ARKQ though....  It's good to have an exit strategy if things go tits up.
Options are an order of magnitude more risky.  you should be proud of what you did, don't worry about the naysayers.     if you want to start adding some options to increase your leverage you can do it more safely by buying  long time frame (think January 2022) options that are in the money.   (lower strike price than the current price)  perhaps $30 strike.  you can get those right now for about 1/2 the cost of the actual shares, so you double your leverage.
Oh there’s still money to be made, not arguing that. I’m just saying there’s better things to spend your time on

Apple went from never being in the phone industry, to completely dominating and changing that industry and our lives for ever. In a snap of a finger.

Look at phones in 2006. And look at phones after. Apple has more money than any company in the world, is already hiring people from Tesla, and will be a fearful competitor, and musk knows this. 

They’re going full steam ahead in the electric car industry and Tesla shareholders should
Be frightened. If you’re not, you’re to emotionally invested in your company.
Are you telling me you’re not a mathematician?
Invest in your knowledge and do value investment. I‘ll try it with a biotech, did a DD and noticed that it’s undervalued. The company name sounds like $PLTR and technologies. There are some products in the pipeline, some with fda approval and the last week it climbed. It had more volume than ever. I think there could be a buyout. Well, wsb doesn‘t allow to write the symbol because it’s a pennystock, yet 🤷‍♂️

Impossible to know.

I lived through the dotcom boom and thought it was going to crash about 2 years before it did. 

I saw outrageous home price inflation in 2003-2004 and refused to buy a home because it was going to crash. It took 2+ years for that crash to actually happen.

I did have puts (and calls) during the Feb [2017... or 2018 if I remembered it right] crash. For that one I thought it would crash at the end of Feb. I was wrong... it happened sooner. Unfortunately, I thought it had further to fall so I didn’t close my puts at or near the bottom. I also then thought the volatility would continue... which it didn’t.

Point is: nobody knows.  You may be right that it will crash but it will take far longer than you think, or it might happen two weeks later.
15.5 but think that is not including money from puts/calls sold, so probably slightly less. Slightly kicking myself I entered the position so gradually, increased my cost unfortunately..
I'm not touching margin, that is completely besides the point. It's a hypothetical situation.

I'm in both, feel good being in both, I could get in deeper on a pullback.
Your first love was alcohol. People say alcoholics just want to forget, but that’s a pessimistic view of alcohol’s power. You never wanted to forget; you had a great life. Rather, you liked the way it was all-consuming. The feeling of being wholly and fully overcome by something. Nothing, except maybe sex, had that effect. Well, you thought so. Until March.

Your second love was options. And it was even more intense than your love for alcohol because it wasn’t accentuated by fogginess, by tiredness. Options inhabited your body and mind with full and willing consciousness. With wakefulness. With coffee and cigarettes and, occasionally, coke.

But the best part was the sense of its limitless potential. Not the infinite upside, but the infinite indulgence. Alcohol had a ceiling each day: blackout and the game was over. But options? You could sell and buy them forever, lucidly aware of every hit. Even when the markets were closed, Futures spoke of what was to come more than any dream about what you’d buy at the liquor store tomorrow had. Because you never had such dreams. Because drunks don’t dream.
It’s actually *too

I agree with this guy.  I think a hangover recession is coming.  Just stagnation till jobs recover.
Not much. But i worry about the outright gambling on this sub (unpopular opinion). Speculating and understanding the risks of a trade is one thing. I did this in Nov20 and lost $50k on assigning a 30-50% chance of the squeeze after the Microsoft deal. That was a speculative play but I understood the risk at least.
If you buy shares on margin, you do not have voting right.

~~Arguably~~ Elon Musk is the most capable industry man in history. 

The video was from a few years ago. Since then Tesla has solved all the issues, while Apple didn't make much progress. 

Basically Tesla won, and continue to be run by the most capable team. Why people think other companies can suddenly snap their fingers and start winning?

Tesla likely will grow from 0.6T to 6T in the next 10 years. Apple 2.2T to 2.5T.

Recently Apple's Titan head retired. Many people view that as bullish. That's strange. If the project is going well, why would the head quit?
I gave up. Sat on my ass holding that shit watching the greatest bull run in history pass me by. I still think they are way undervalued but also Fuck Tankergang

March-Nov was the greatest bull market in recent memory. QQQJ caught the tail end.  You’re expecting a repeat macro bull performance for the next six months, may happen but highly unlikely. You’re gonna trade sideways until trump leaves and biden/yellen/Powell firmly guide the economy back.

Question: are there any options for GME? call/put? Or do there only the shares exist? I want to trade with an european broker and I don’t have any puts or calls. Only the opportunity to buy the shares.
That whole sub is your posting threads but no comments haha. I feel like more examples in the same area would explain a bit of it, no? Whole country is on upside but with rates being so low it’s to be expected for a bit longer, I think. I’m probably wrong. But I agree realtors for the most part don’t seem worth it. I’m in the Bay Area and used one and it was helpful. Was able to utilize their network to get an off market deal in cash for a price I wanted and my house had some problems that were able to be overlooked. Worked out nicely
Why will it tank monday and should I buy when it does

Bought the dip aggressively and actually broke even some time ago. I aint hopping back in there, id rather bet on steel. Pretty much what tankers are worth in the current environment anyway
I dont know.. i see we already had inflation and now because wages are stagnant we will likely see deflationary pressure.  I could see more inflation briefly but afterwards people have less income through this so deflation will occur.

I used to think I understood inflation and deflation but in the end its not rates and printing money.  Its the money people have and their incomes because if all costs go up something has to give when income doesn’t follow so you see it in one part of the economy first then it cascades.

I think housing will see an inability to go higher soon even with low rates. Other products we are seeing costs rise.

I’m not saying we will see huge changes but i dont see deflation or inflation on any wild scale here going forward.
Nah pretty gay

Coupon for 1 free back rub from Peter Lafleur, slam dunk IMO
His leverage wasn’t as extreme as you’d see today, but he still took those loans with shorter callable periods. Liquidity and solvency become the same issue if your creditor decides you’re too much risk. 

I respect the hell out of him for making cash deals work, but then he turns around and gives stupid advice like taking a 15-year rather than just overpaying installments on a 30-year. He also doesn’t understand the long term returns of the market and recommends his audience invest in higher fee mutual funds.
N P A
Yessssss
Just do what I did. Start out by getting your toes wet. Figure out what options, buy some FDs, lose some money, learn more, get lucky, and now that making money is now on easy mode, do some more riskier trades, lose more money, learn from your mistakes, except you don't and you just lose more money, but this time you don't feel anything because money is a human construct and you've ascended to enlightenment so life is meaningless, but this is when you figure out the meaning of stock markets and start scribbling your mathematics on the walls and windows with chalk, then that's when you start hearing the voices and new people that tell you to make the option calls you've been waiting for, and in the greatest mental breakdown and self-reflection of your entire life, you reach the most significant life changing epiphany while staring in the mirror and say "oh I get it now, I'm retarded"
Reminds me of the HELOC guy from last November that got cyberfucked by TSLA. But I think he made most of his money back and some in January.
Don’t take a fucking loan to gamble jesus christ
You realize that Baba was at $320 per share and climbing before the CCP intervened right? 😂😂
The CCP has their hands in every Chinese business and contribute to their success or cause their downfall. Look at BABA’s revenue numbers compared to Amazon and ask yourself why one is trading in the thousands and one is declining despite both having record years

Oh. So the 200 EMA on the daily was around 252 and held for a bit so now that it broke, 200 on the weekly is next and if that breaks, 200 EMA on the monthly? Although the monthly doesn't seem to exist yet.

Why not the 100 EMA on the weekly? Price bounced off around it on Friday.
Why TAK?
Any1 else not gay?
No idea what you're talking about.  Funneling money into a loan with a 2.5% interest rate when you can be putting that money elsewhere and getting a bigger return is objectively retarded
A couple months ago I was at the airport around midnight getting a rental car at closing time. There was grown man there with his whole family losing his mind over the fact that he needed a credit card to rent a car.  I kept thinking “I bet this dumbass worships Dave Ramsey, lol”.  So the rental place closed and stranded this guy at the airport.  I wonder what ever happened to him?

PLTR is 1/3rd my portfolio. 300 shares at $24.63. Last week sold 3 12/31 $31c when the price was $29 for $74 a piece for $223. Free tendies if you play it right. IV is too high for fd’s.

Been following the Roaring Kitty live stream for about 2 months. Had never heard of DFV or visited WSB until a few days ago. This guy is the illest, chillest, most humble dude. Reading the incredulous pessimism in some of the comments on his first WSB post from 9/8/2019 is entertaining in hindsight.

All who are commending ballsack size -- yes -- but brain power and experience maybe even moreso. Any of the 200+ hours of live stream vids (backlogged on his YT channel) communicate the dude is heavily equipped with experience and has a real methodical and savvy process in screening for value. Good energy and a sense of humor to boot. His spreadsheets alone are [sorcerer-level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wjWnMcdnlQ&t=7s):

Congrats RK/DFV. Now that I can see the portfolio screenshots I need a few days to digest this case study. I didn't realize you've been long since at least SEP 2019, and didn't realize your position was so heavily freighted with calls. What a sick story.

&#x200B;

Edit: correction. In since at least JUN 2019! 

Edit 2: RK I can't believe you're the "some guy lost over $1M on wallstreet bets today" who I read about in the comments section of a Seeking Alpha after the brutal week of OCT 30. What a riot.

Yeah in the world of seeing rocket ship returns it's hard to respect 20-30% gains. Consistency on the other hand over a fair amount of time could grow an account substantially. I work hard for my money and I'm not about to post a several thousand dollar loss. This is an excellent vehicle to grow and it has exponential properties should the market continue to expand.

If you dont mind riding the turbulence, you should probably still invest in solid companies and hold long term (aka boomer investing). Otherwise, I guess you can always try your luck riding meme stocks with the proper hedges and safety.
Maybe now there’s some certainty about the path ahead for ANT, it’s better overall for sentiment (as the market hates uncertainty) (noted tho that it clips ANT’s wings a bit)

The "discs are dead" crowd is almost as bad as the bLoCkBuStEr crowd. There's a reason that all the high end consoles still have disc drives, people want the option. They only got cut from the budget consoles, most likely as a way to save cash. 

Game files keep getting bigger and bigger and this is only going to increase with the rise of 4k gaming. Memory upgrades aren't cheap, especially if you want to upgrade the internal memory and not just use a portable hard drive. Having a physical copy avoids all of this. I know it's been mentioned as a joke but parents and grandparents are also more likely to buy a physical copy, especially as gifts. 

I'm not trying to say that disc's are going to revolutionize anything. But people are making a way bigger issue out of it than it is.

If chart patterns are so reliable than show me a hedge fund or other entity that consistently beats the market with them in the long term. Majority of strategies can be deemed as successful because historically the market goes up. Most people buying stock shares eventually make money. Go on any stocktwits thread and see these chart people. If the chart predictions are right they declare victory. When they're wrong they just say "resistance is broken and now here's the new resistance line....". Eventually they will be right at some point. Confirmation bias and survivorship bias. If charts were so effective there should be mounds of data proving it. I do suspect there are tons of cautious investors who set stop losses and limit sells periodically and the algos take advantage. But the charts would have a hard time predicting those subjective price patterns

Started in January this year. Didn't know much about the stock market in general but quickly started learning and putting small sums of money. Invested in small cap companies until the March crash and foolishly didn't buy into quality companies until a bit after September 2nd. Put around 15k into Tesla, Square, Corsair, Google, ARKG, Mind med and clean energy stocks. Still holding and plan to hold for years to come and will keep adding to existing positions. Got into Palantir in October (thanks WSB).

Same, but also girl
My first statement would be that no walled garden has ever survived.  Remember AOL?  Prodigy?  So go these companies goes Facebook.  It's just a matter of time.

In the VR space (I was working on VR games in the 90s but am only a enthousiast now)  there are MANY companies working on both VR and AR.  Facebook has a significant head start but by no means are they the only one.  And other companies are quickly closing the technology gap and exceeding it.  Now that Facebook has shown the way with Quest it's just a matter of time for some up and comer or someone like Apple to drop a bomb on the market with something new.  Facebook has shown there is gold in the hills and prospectors are going to come running.  Once someone offers something better/cooler we will see Facebook forced to open the walls to others to stay competitive.  Already you see developers fighting back against this and developing games exclusively for SteamVR or WMR.  The last few major titles Facebook had to fund to maintain an exclusive.  The recent Star Wars title Tales from the galaxy's edge is considered a flop by the hard core Star Wars gaming enthousist.  I didn't even buy it and I am such a Star Wars fan I paid $2000 for an original Star Wars movie poster which is framed in my office.

Facebook has made even qualifying to release a title on the Oculus prohibitively difficult.  This is driving developers away from the Oculus platform.  There are many in the current user base that are walking away from the platform.  Myself included.  I have 5 of the Oculus devices.  I was fully committed to the Oculus VR platform from the kickstarter.  I got one of the first CV1s first few days of release (I think mine showed up 2 days after release).  However admittedly I am no longer Facebook's target market.  Now it's the same market as the original Nintendo.  Nintendo is no longer the front runner in the game space.  They are basically an also ran.  I see the same for Facebook at some point.

Finally Facebook is under a lot of legal pressure for monopolistic activity.  Germany just brought a legal claim against them for forcing the use of Facebook on the Quest.  I believe there is one coming in the US as well.  This will likely force them withdraw the requirement for a facebook account.  Then where are they?

I even see social media going away.  The social media crowd is a fickle bunch.  People are leaving Facebook in droves.  The adoption of Facebook and VR is an attempt to stave off the loss of the user base.  The social media crowd is all about the latest and greatest.  Now that Grandma is on Facebook it's no longer cool so you see "kids" moving to the next new thing.

Likely we are seeing the peak of Facebook.  If not now, in the near future.

"So I sold my PLTR, and I have 1800 buying power what’s my next move"

I genuinely hate people like you OP, maybe not hate but rather a strong distaste. You fumble around without an original thought of your own. You flood WSB with abosultely mornic shit like "wHat MMA nzt mUve boz?", It's fine not to understand this shit but spamming the discussion thread with your petty leech like behavior is disgusting and what's gotten you in this position in the first place. Like fuck all these people flooding shit asking for moves / plays, you literally can find a move if you look through the discussion or other outlets but instead you doubt yourself so much you need an internet stranger to tell you what to do with your own money. 

It's pathetic, just stop man while you've got something left.
Such a vague unanswerable question. I used to work two jobs and then worked while going to college. The funny thing is now I make six figures and am not as fucking motivated as I was when I worked my ass off not making as much. Don’t get me wrong, I am working towards the next promotion but it’s different depending on where you are at in life. It’s okay to enjoy your family and your shit and not just work all the time.

I agree. We will see if commodities stay elevated after the world gets back to precovid levels of production and supply. Demand will outstrip supply initially. But that will give the fed even more incentive to pump. They cant have deflation where people postpone purchasing expecting prices to drop in the future.
I just bought my air frier from them so these folks are certified bullish
☺️
I started with the DD section. Sort by new so you get in early. Pick the stocks with good DD. If you don’t understand the financials, then at least check that the company makes a profit and/or doesn’t have a lot of debt outstanding. 

This is by no means the best advice, but it’s a simple way to get started and minimize the risk if you’re choosing to follow these autists.
Alright enough muckin about

It won’t
da perfect broad
If you get in the money calls and there are strong upward catalysts ahead that you're confident about you won't lose it all.

Also, if you're only doing weeklies, than of course it can and often will go tits up.

But picking a company that will most likely have growth, and then getting in the money calls for three months out will usually pay off as long as you pick a solid play.
I didn't know shit about the market in March and I made a killing. Then I rly looked into the Greeks, DDs in here, and all that shit.... That's when the nonstop Ls came in.

Hi, hoping to be able to check out the source code. Very cool!
No I had 💎👋 and lost my 1000% gains, could’ve paper handed but I honestly had faith in another run up until trump tweeted some shit, still was up 250% or so on weeklies and yeah I’m tempted to throw $$$ at more weeklies and hopefully make enough to buy Apr C, I know the plan am just broke so what’s the point in a single contract 🤷‍♂️

It is covered in the last DD. 

But basically once the warrants become exercisable, the management team has the option to call a warrant redemption. In my understanding its not that scary. Basically once the warrants become exercisable by you, PSTH can issue the redemption. They have to give you 30 days notice and they can only do it if the stock is trading above $36 for 20 of 30 trading days. If you don't act, they take the warrants for 1 penny each.

Long story short, just don't fall asleep. The worst case scenario here is that the stock goes to $36 and they exercise the redemption. Then, you buy the warrants at 23 and sell the shares or hold on to them, whatever.

Just don't fall asleep when things get active and you'll be fine.

That said, Iron ore dropped over 6% on the 23rd. 

I think you are spot on with your concerns. I feel like this play is betting on the next two earnings reports looking promising, and demand continuing to increase. If demand doesn't increase then I agree with you that any gains will be very temporary.

I own real estate in China. We have right to private property. And no one I know there or myself fears the govt will come and take it. That’s a Western fantasy people here like to say to convince themselves their own country is safer/better. Most of the bias against China here are outright fabrications by the MSM. Of course the govt here want Americans to hate anything communist - the very foundation of democracy will be broken if people here thinks socialism could be the way forward - esp. now. In reality, there are flaws to every govt system.

Bro do you see how many rockets there are there. Jump on Cathie Woods rocket and ride it like it’s your wife’s strap on to the fucking moon.
You can feel comfortable getting in between $25-27. It’s been heavily supported around $27. Stocks or LEAPS my good sir. If you are concerned it’s better to get in on stocks and make premium off of CC’s.
TLDR: 84% of shorts having their asses wide open waiting for big shrek green dildos.

2nd half of twentieth century (post war bull market,less spent on healthcare, unaffordable pensions hadn’t come home to roost...etc..etc) - that ended in the 70’s btw- i would know- from an industrial midwest city. 

We can agree on something- cost of healthcare...We can agree healthcare cost is out of control as we subsidize the rest of the world, and pay too much, and agree to its inflated value for services. If citizens/govt paid less in healthcare it changes everything. Most gov debt is healthcare related. Look at the cost of healthcare in relation to everything else.

Also the last twenty years of the twentieth century was not ideal where im from.

Housing prices is much more nuanced. The lower interest rates are actually driving up prices in some areas.

Americans are also living farther beyond their means than before while having more bills

So since baba investigation is over it moon Monday or not because of the ANT group article
Damn this got me so hype
Can you imagine what it's like to place some of these trades with millions of dollara?
Oh snap.  Keep your day and side hustle job.
yea people genuinely think that the movement of planet Mars somehow personally affects their life lmao same with TA.

If TA worked we would see TA firms at the top of the hedge fund list.
For what expiry?
At least you got some awards for your Reddit post. Things are looking up
What city?
A news article you probably wrote for your fanpage 😉
Realtors and loan officers will try and convince you this is completely normal and will go on for years

https://www.reddit.com/r/REBubble/comments/kh9anc/completely_normal/

Realtors are in the top ten biggest scumbags... 

1. Anyone can become one
2. Get paid way too much (glad to see Zillow and Redfin direct are putting them on a 40k salary where they belong)
3. They contributed the last housing crash in many ways


The worst are

1. Realtors
2. Influencers

Will need to think about the other 8

So glad Zillow now pays them a flat $60 for doing a home showing 😹. Not sure how they were making thousands doing the same thing.

I had this realtor sign me up for alerts and they were the same thing I already got from Zillow ... they just came into my mailbox later
ANT financial is fucked, yes.  
ANT was valued at 300 Billion.   
**One third** of that market cap is tied to BABA.   


I believe it is quite bullish for the investigation to conclude so fast and that it will mostly target ANT. Since their ATH, BABA lost almost the entire value of ANT in market cap, it is sure to rebound as we now know, that BABA as a whole is not screwed, only ANT.
Oh shit

How did you find out about it while it was at that low price if you don’t mind me asking? I’m a noob and WSB is currently my main source of news on stocks.
Im into it, that's why gme getting into esports sounded like a joke.
Lol. Obviously, I would have been better off not reducing. I subsequently sold my gold and BABA positions for slight losses and bought MARA calls on the 24th. I'm still holding plenty of shares of RIOT and MARA at very low entry prices. 

Bottom line, I took profits at over 100% gain and secured my initial investment. Psychologically this will give me a steadier hand to hold going forward.
I wanna get into pltr so bad but it looks a lil pricy right now. Prolly gonna regret waiting for the dip.

I love this - my favorite option strategy. Right now, I'd totally do this on AAPL and AMZN for the earnings run-up. You get to scratch the itch of doing options with better risk management. 

My strategy is to look for expiries 2 months out, find a spread trading at 60% or less of potential max value (so $3 or less for a $5 spread) and then close out when it gets to about 80% of max value. 

The only downsides are that there's no thrill of seeing your options explode in value even when the stock has a good run-up and you can hit max loss if there's a big dip.
I made money with tankers. Still waiting for them MSFT calls to print.
For manufacturing business needs labor. Literally ppl who will only do not-so-big-deal jobs. I don’t think there is problem with finding such people around the world AND that there is lack of such people, who want to experience “american dream”

With pretty great success, I have followed hybrid strategy of using Dave Ramsey’s 12 baby steps to keep my expenses low, build up a big emergency fund, and max contribute to my 401k. But that’s where it goes off the rails. Next, I built up a YOLO, lost it all, then did it again and hit it big on some AMD calls. I have been winning ever since, and now have a net worth over a million. Thank you, Dave Ramsey, for helping me with the low cost living side of my financial existence. Admittedly, I’ve done almost nothing to address my gambling addiction, because I tried again and became a consistent winner. I do all of this to eventually become a bigtime philanthropist. Remember back when you lost it all by getting all levered up in the housing market? I’m on the same path, brother. The way to financial peace is through the Prince of Peace, Christ Jesus, and a fuckton of GME shares.

Amazon, yes but I now have positions in Amazon. Google I missed my opportunity as I don’t buy puts as stocks are streaking down, and as soon as it hit the $1500-1600 range and my dad said he was investing in it I lost interest in shorting it. Microsoft, I didn’t see when he released a buy rating on Microsoft but I did catch the 210-202 drop and I was banging on the door for people to short them on earnings. Didn’t short FB because who the hell bets against Michael Burry? APPL, I had a long position and had to buy puts to cover my position during that horrendous 136-100 crash(sold out of the puts position at $112 bought in at $126).
Paying off a 30 year loan faster than 30 years when interest rates are at literal historic lows is about the dumbest thing you can do. Nice job, you belong here

[A surge in inflation seems unlikely](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/12/12/a-surge-in-inflation-looks-unlikely)
This article gives some compelling arguments against inflation. 

TL;DR
Even if the Feds and central banks want to let inflation increase, they will face opposition from finance ministries.

Also, following the New Keynesian model, inflation depends on public expectations of price rises and the health of the labour market. Both of which point to low inflation.

You should look into sepp payments, substantial equal periodic payments, where if you withdraw a certain amount every year you can avoid the 10percnet penalty. But you may have to do it until death, the early retirement bloggers talk about it alot, I'm pretty sure the madfientist.com has a post about it. Might be worth looking into if it applies to 401ks.

Deflation seems more likely than inflation. They can’t even get inflation going and they’re trying they’re ass off to do it.

Omg that’s what he meant? I’m in too
Death :/
No, you’re missing that medical expenses can be reimbursed from the hsa at any time in the future, tax free. Pulling money out now misses out on tax free growth. It’s worth far more to me in the account than out of it.

Also, once you hit 65 an HSA allows for penalty free withdrawals subject to normal income tax. It’s functionally a traditional IRA with extra benefits.
Maybe do your own research. It’s after Q4 earnings in February.
Not uncommon in PE land

Seriously though, you’re arguing that it makes more sense to pay medical expenses with taxed money than with pre-tax money (it doesn’t).  Then take money from a HSA and spend it on things that are non-qualifying, non-medical, and therefore non-tax free expenses.

Nobody says you gotta use the tools the way they were intended.  You do you man, but dang what a weird way to do business.

I’ve been thinking of buying puts as a hedge. I thought long and hard about it and realized that’s straight stupid. Just load more on red days. If you wanna be safer, sell cash secured puts on the red days and use that premium for more shares.

TA doesn't account for everything, which is why it needs to be taken witha grain of salt... Hedgies want a fresh start for 2021... If they are smart
COVID is not slowing down yet, and may not be slowing down by mid Jan either, so if you think EPS on insurance was taking a hit because of that then it will still be part of the next earnings report. Outside of EPS, pricing in the slowdown of COVID might be fully there by the end of Jan with a large uncertainty around the inaugural address, but already I’d say it is 85%+ priced in.

I think EPS gets a boost from people not driving: they aren’t getting in accidents either by not driving or by driving on roads with less traffic but they still have insurance because you pretty much need it when you have a car registered.
We’ll ignore that.

I have lived in China. There’s no racism and riots. Their govt provides for their citizens unlike here you can’t even get a $600 stimmy. Life is actually pretty good there (yes, including for peasants). Why is saying life’s good in China so hard for ya’ll to accept? It’s like an instant barrage of attacks “but they’re communist” “go live in China” lolol Check your bias. 

Yes individual freedom is limited but you get more safety and the Chinese people are happy with that and whether Americans like it or not, China will continue to dominate economically.

You’re over-dramatizing what I’m saying. Not everyone can be rich, obviously, and you know that’s not what I’m saying. In most of the 2nd half of the 20th century, it was a LOT easier to a buy a house, and wages for working class jobs went a lot further. You know full well we don’t compare at all today. Yes someone always gets shit on, if that’s what you use to sleep well at night, but there are more Americans getting shit on than there needs to be. More people living in debt their entire lives to outrageous medical expenses, housing prices and rising cost of living than there ever has been. That’s not “someone,” that’s a significant fraction of our society. If you just write off a hundred million people as peasants that deserve it because they weren’t born into the middle class, you’re ignorant. 👋🏼

I'm not talking doomsday hyperinflation gay bear shit. I'm talking a rise in prices and yes it is coming because it's already here. Lumber has been pushing cost of construction for months and now is projected to stay high at least until mid year. It has retreated some in the most recent month. I know that because a 2 × 4 is still double what it was a year ago.

The fed has said they would allow above 2% inflation   rather than raise rates. So they plan to pump for the foreseeable future.
I don't see the money in my account as money anymore. It's really just trying to get a new high score. On the other hand because I live on a quarter of my actual paycheck (the rest goes into stonks) getting a nice Christmas present does feel good because it's not something I'd get myself.

So say I saw uncle spackman and papa Elon doing the dirty and then they go public on Twitter and merge PSTH with spacex via SPAC under the impression that bill would make more SPACs for musk per valuation of boring company, neural link, Star link, and then reverse merger into a holding company called X? Think about all the experience bill has doing that exact thing with burger king via SPAC last time. Also imagine the markets crash like March 2020 then bill ackman scoops hella cash and forms more SPACs that way 🤔Tesla could tank the market if musk keeps diluting the company while its in the S&P (I wonder if the S&P can support it or escalate the decent) I think PSTH is resistant to crashes because bill ackmans hedge would only go to benefit the SPAC

It's not clear if it's good or bad because it will cause the entire addressable market to expand. In an industry where leverage is enormous this may improve profitability.

You can't just take a concept about established mature markets and apply it to everything. Actually, i guess you can but it would be wrong and lead to incorrect conclusions. But I sense you're pretty much dedicated to a POV here so you can have the last word.

In this context, there’s nothing about communism that guarantees you a right to private property. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. So you’re basically taking the property (money) you’ve acquired in a free country and giving it to the CCP, with nothing but a hope that they’ll let you continue to access it.

Rough numbers but lots of decimals bc I’m lazy (eyeballing crayon lines) but precise (the calculator gives me decimals I’m gonna use them), but based on EPS LMND on Nov 10 had historically reported a quarterly loss equivalent to about $100m(3.6% of IPO price or 2.5% of close on IPO day)when estimates were closer to $50m(2x worse than estimates) and had just had its next estimated losses adjusted from $37.6M to $35M. It also had a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better (belonged to a group of stocks that via 10yr back test show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns).

Currently ROOT reported a quarterly loss of more like 586M(8.85% of IPO price and even more at end of IPO day) based on EPS when estimates were closer to 122M (4.8x worse than estimates) and currently estimates are that next earnings will report losses around 186.4M

Come mid February if it is still rating 3 or better on https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/ROOT and most accurate estimate is -0.7 or better then it might be in the same classification as LMND and simply 3 months behind, but based on the much higher losses I doubt the climb will be as sudden or as high. Hold me to it, yeah? Maybe first or 2nd week of feb for checking estimates to see if the play is good per the one standard, then mid or late March to see what the climb looked like.

Tough to be sure but doing some calculations in my head I'd say odds of expiring worthless are over 99%.
I bought it before they hiked the price up. It was $1100 at the time shipped directly to my door. It’s pure hardwood lol. The only thing not made from walnut is the metal cable management bracket and a small part of the legs.

I feel like $1100 for real walnut isn’t horribly priced lol. Considering how long hardwood can last if you care for it. If I amortized the cost over 5-10 years, which this desk can easily last... the price is extremely affordable. Personally I would highly recommend the desk to anyone that wants something simple.

I don’t want a 1000# desk and 6 cabinets with s tray. I just wanted a nice workspace with the aesthetics that I personally enjoy.

I had a sit/stand and honestly never used the function. I get up and move from my desk so often that it wasn’t a issue for me.

I love your comments. Reminds me of t2 when Arnie slowly goes down into molten metal and leaves Sean John Conor with a thumbs up. That will be me to you. I hope you all make money friends. Even when I don’t.
This sub is the kind of place where a man goes all in betting black in a casino and doubles his money on black 14, then the whole sub calls him a retard for not betting 14. And I love it.
Are you sure? Look at institutional ownership percentage — it’s over 100%. As long as shorts keep doing their thing and buying puts that force MM to naked short the stock, owning conceivably all the float — or more than 100%, is possible.  

The short squeeze thesis is based around an event that would trigger the sudden need to unwind this web of shares that don’t actually exist.  Imagine a shareholder conference that only had 100 chairs, but 200 people showed up because they all hold tickets. Melvin capital is the guy outside who sold the extra 100 tickets for seats that don’t exist. Some of the ticket holders are willing to give up their ticket for about $420.69 each. The question becomes what sort of binary event would force a shareholder meeting where all 200 would willingly show up (vote)?
That's nuts.

Exactly. That’s a 1 billion dollar question. They really believe GME is going bankrupt, and don’t want to settle for less. Truth is, they are still short, and even doubled down recently. They see the current run up as a reversed dip. BTDF I guess

See, this is a weapon. One cannot wish to contain the power of so many retards condensed into one small area of the internet. We simply cannot wield that much power, however, there is another way. Instead of using it to our will, we might be able to redirect the course of that power in the direction that we desire. Rather than controlling the entire river, we'd simply be changing its flow to go wherever we wish.

Honestly Tesla is fucking amazing. I feel like most of the time we hear about companies making new revolutionary products, like some sort of car or whatever it may be, and years go by and I still never see it once or hear about the company ever again. Then Elon comes along says he’s gonna do something and basically start pumping out cars right away.
Means he’s gonna fuck his sister
I’m in this camp. Could be my ignorance but I don’t think just looking at the superficial #s on shares shorted tells the full picture. That is, I’m not in it for the mythical MOASS. I do think short squeezening has happened a few times (with the violent run-ups). Basically, the price floor is moving up steadily and there is a near-zero chance of bankruptcy while investors await more details in GME’s future vision. Omnichannel

First movie was definitely overrated. Gal is so great though.
Please go to YouTube and type in “calls and puts explained”. Once you buy a call, to close the position and take profits you need to sell to close. Your max loss no matter what is the price you paid (premium) for the call. 

Options are complex because there’s aspects like time and volatility that affect your profit. The stock can go up and you can still not make profit on your option. 

This isn’t a educational place. We cry here
Well with my friends I had this discussion like 5-6 years ago when we were choosing between investing in Alibaba or Tencent and all of us said Tencent, why? Because Jack Ma the founder of Alibaba is famous, loved, followed and talks a lot. He has also shown in many cases his interests in western ideas, he went on US medias etc. In China, CCP don’t like people that talks a lot, people that are influent and have ties with western countries because they are threat to party! I actually could see this coming from long ago. 
Alibaba will be back soon I guess, we are talking about a fucking giant, top 1-2 Chinese company owning Taobao (the Amazon of China), Alipay, E le me (the Deliveroo of China) and many other (there is list of there owning it it’s nuts). No doubt they will stand steel they just need some cleaning and some mouth to shut!

Ok so plan is on 28th to hop into L.(C).A, they have their investor meeting on the 29th, hopefully approve the merger. See if we get a decent % and then sell, then hop into ORI and either hope for run up to the 5th or if it goes sideways just hold through the 5th and collect dividend anyway, then maybe give it a couple days to chill out and hop back into GME if it hasn't already exploded and wait for a squeeze 

So am I gonna lose just most of, or all of my money?

Unfortunately, Melvin Capital (the largest shorter I believe) got in at $40. So they can still hold for some time
Haha yawn is the best you got. My stimulus check isn’t going to be any bigger than the taxes I paid this year, so I might as well be spending my own money, don’t flatter yourself. Capitalism is great, I don’t know why you think there can’t be a happy medium where the common person doesn’t get shit on by the system. The majority of Americans today will find it hard to ever acquire any wealth, pretty much live paycheck to paycheck, and the top of the lower percentiles 40-50th percentile, might retire. And I’m not even in the majority. Not everyone can just up and work their way to a higher quality of life. The system has to give a shit about the bottom half too, and right now it doesn’t. You’re a selfish braggart. Enjoy your comfort.

Go nuts dude, I have no stake in GME either way. It looks like you’re not from America so I’m just letting you know how it is here. GameStop has a terrible reputation and most gamers wouldn’t be caught dead in one- how that will effect the stock in this crazy ass market, I don’t know.

A) Yes, you're super autistic and B) Yes, if you buy calls for a premium of $0.63 and GME increases in value as a stock, your contracts will appreciate in value and be worth more than you paid (it's not always that simple, but if this were to happen this week, they should increase). What you do when they do increase in value is up to you

Competition may not technically ever be good for profits but that assumes a developed market with high market penetration and adequate infrastructure (i.e. fast food).

In the case of electric cars there is not adequate infrastructure. Apple would not only be coming in as a competitor but they would also bring a lot of pressure to upgrading the charging infrastructure both public and private. Right now, let's just say half of the country can't even consider electric cars because they rent and there is no way for them to charge their car each day. Having Apple involved may yield bigger tax breaks, for example, for homeowners (or building owners) that install charging ports for tenants. Etc. The infrastructure for electric cars is in its infancy.

It took Elon that long because there was no financial support for him. He was the first. He had to do everything from his paypal money of 1.5 billion. He put like 50 mil in SpaceX and 10 mil in Tesla. What he did was impossible to think mainly because of financial constraints.   
Now Apple has at least 200 billion cash on hand. A giga factory takes 5 billion according to Elon. Apple can scale up rapidly.   
Also there is a rumor that Apple's electric car battery is only second to Tesla. It's the Toshiba Scib batteries with lithium titanate.

You're right, this is survivors bias and I didn't make the point very well so let me restate it since this is the most controversial of all my posts in here.  If you believe that genomics / AI and the combination of the two will be more relevant in 20 years than they are today, invest in these companies.  I believe this is the case but I don't know which one(s) will be the survivors and that is why I choose the ETF that combines them.
I think traditionally cuz they’re allowed to sell that day, if they want out it causes a dump. Otherwise it’ll be pretty flat if they want to hold their shares. Maybe go up afterwards because the potential downside is over with and it becomes more attractive to investors

It’s funny seeing retards stuck holding bags and they try to shill it as “*insert ticker* new meme stock”, shut the fuck up buddy, hold the bag.
I trade spreads on AAPL with about 2 month expirations because most of the value is packed into the last couple of days of the spread. Since growing my account I've started to widen the strikes and to take on a little more risk. You could open a 2-3 month spread with a $30 strike gap and bump your return potential up to 3:1 with a break even only a few dollars above current value. Time in the market beats timing the market.

AAPL has excellent fundamentals, PE within reason comparatively to the market, products lead the market, every index investor continues to boost value, promise of delivering autonomous systems while getting into the subscription service market, and they like to buy back shares instead of issuing new ones like the rest of these tech companies.

It may not be as sexy as some other premium products but while the fed continues to prop this market up I'm willing to bet it's one of the most secure investments available.

Not to mention it is one of the most traded options available making sure you get accurate premiums and liquidity.
Ah. Can't go tits up. Nice

Dude this hits. I was never taught finances in school, never taught finances by my parents, the only person who taught me anything was fuckin Dave Ramsey when I was 18 years old my church had this thing where you watched a couple of his videos. That’s where I learned that I need to make a budget, that there are down sides to credit cards, the idea of compound interest. 

I’d like to think my financial sense has matured since then but Dave was the only starting point I had

Go look at his portfolio. How many major misses do you see in there?


And he's not wrong about Tesla being massively overvalued, even Musk said it. Burry just bought too early. I'm sure it'll crash someday. Maybe.
Well that’s no fun
01/21/22 25c it is. But wouldn't it be smarter to buy it on Friday? Because this thing will moon tomorrow?
Majority from what I'm understanding is that it went down because of rumors of delisting and alibaba's problems
I do agree there is a ton of downside and my plan is to get out Monday or Tuesday regardless. I’ve been watching it since IPO and initially went in on 100 shares and sold those tor about 5k profit. But with how it’s seemingly dipped and recovered it just doesn’t feel like the bottom is dropping out SOON unless we have some bad developments in the bigger picture.

Eat the dip
The heart wants what the heart wants. The penis and vagina can't be trusted. And the brain is basically a giant bio super computer. TL:DR people are basically powered by windows 98 (retarded)
And it's going to stay cheap for at least the end of 2021. Besides, even if we have a drop, just buy the dip. The Fed basically said it won't let the market crash.

Looks like a good target but if it’s such a visionary undervalued stock why isn’t Cathie buying it?
Nah its ridiculously overvalued now. Its become an investment vehicle for the people who already have them to push onto others to buy. It was always meant to be a currency, but people are too scared to use it as such as you'll lose out on gains.

Keep an eye on CMPS, they could be taking off with Psilocybin becoming more and more acceptable as a substitute to your usual anti-depressants.
No moon missions for BABA. Tread carefully
Pain pills are amazing but be sure to take prunelax, constipation is a side effect

I appreciate a good counterpoint but this is retard-level DD. You showed two lines and didnt even label them or explain them. Are they MAs? Seems to me like big brain math. It doesnt take a genius to know that GME will be volatile for the foreseeable. Will there be near-term downside? I think so. Do they have a tough road ahead in transitioning their biz into the modern era? Duh! It’s the paper-handed simps here that make GME gang look bad. I think the risk reward is fantastic and it’s def a medium- to long-term investment. RC is a major catalyst here. Even bigger than the HCQ-loving retard Cassandra.
Go up or down

I've been doing ITM debit spreads on SPY, ones that cost roughly 80 and are worth 100 if they expire ITM. Done a few ATMs, I like the ITMs more because they gain value quickly. 80 to 90 takes a day, and then I close and go to the next.

I've went long on a few, but you are right. If you can generate 50% returns 90% of the time, its bank. And long term SPY and others will.

Okay, so let's say revenue will increase. My next question is, how is the market going to respond to a strong earnings report from MT in February? At first thought it might seem obvious that a good ER = share prices will go up. 

However, in this case I am concerned that the market will think that this is just a strong ER because of the special circumstances and that the supply will soon be able to meet demand again. So won't the market expect the steel prices to eventually return to normal again and therefore they will not drive up the share prices in February?
I really appreciate this in Ryan's letter:

Ok man. That’s not true at all. Call it what you want. But China cares about foreign investors, we are not talking about North Korea ffs. China depends as much on the US as the US depends on China.

The fact that they shared data does it matter? Like every company has our data, if they get us sanctions on them or something then sure. But idk... It might just get looked over.

Capitalism or non capitalism are two ends on a scale. There is no 100% capitalist place in the world. Thank god.

There are very few places without almost any capitalism but it’s not really viable as one can see in North Korea.
Most places are somewhat in the middle; doing some things right and some wrong. It’s not about it but how smart to spend public money. 

Even many pretty call it libertarian or free market dudes with macro wouldn’t deny that trickle down doesn’t really work anymore in the current and recent macro environment and any relief for the top will end up in assets rather than the production while stimulating the bottom and middle might be more effective. Be it with UBI or other means.

This has always perplexed me.  What happens to the debt you accrue from the property when you declare bankruptcy.  It's not like the debt from the house and car are wiped out, that debt still exists.  Is the only reason to file so that your old debt is wiped out and your credit is still good enough to borrow at a lower rate?

Also, I've looked at this as a viable short term option on CCs by buying a ton of gold and then declaring bankruptcy and it's fraud.

I think facebooks biggest threat right now is they are a software platform that runs on some kind of computing device. This is why they are in a pissing match with Apple right now, they feel the threat that Apple could take away their access to the users.

I think Zuck is interested in AR/VR for the tech piece because it’s cool. But I also think FB always is thinking about how vulnerable they are in the phone world and what they could do in an emergency to get direct access to users. But who the hell would want to use a Facebook phone???

 the main point of my argument is that it is not xenophobic to say Xi can torpedo China company any time. If you really believe China cares about foreign investors you are delusional. Buying this dip is the most retarded stuff right now. Furthermore I don’t believe BABA bounced after the first “dip” they had months ago when all they had to do was pay the fine.

Ehhh, the military and scientific "leaps" are all stolen from other countries/companies. They still struggle to keep ships out to sea for long periods of time and are far from the blue water navy they're aspiring/claim to be. They plan to take over Taiwan by 2030 and that'll be the spark that starts war in the south china sea and while it'll be a pain in the ass to get them out of there, they aren't a threat much further outside of that area. They've built up artificial islands and added missile defenses which is why it'll be hard to get them out of there, not due to their naval tactics and procedures. The reason no one is dropping bombs on them is cause they don't want to lose an election cause the price of products go up when you have to bring manufacturing jobs back to their own country. Nothing to do with chinese military brilliance cause again, most of their shit has been stolen and their army is massive, not feared but massive. My money is still on the U.S. war machine/allies and as always fuck the CCP and the atrocities that they have done and continue to do.

Yeah, the biggest thing is opportunity cost but just go for ones that have a vote/merger date to solve that. SPACs can briefly go under $10, even $9 which I've seen on some during the March crash but if the target is announced, that's less likely to happen.
Yeah its what i tell myself, all early adopters probably got out. Just seeing the numbers though, least im not the pizza guy or the welsh guy from Newport who threw his hard-drive away .

The HARD way. This one gets it.
Found WSB the beginning of this year. Never traded options before (graduated college 2 years ago). Made good money this year from starting a business. After the big covid drop I yoloed our house downpayment money, first 20k then 40k on calls. Ended up doing around 150% gains (all 1 year long option calls). Bought our new house. Originally wasnt going to be able to afford furniture but with the gains we were able to buy w/e we wanted for the house. Was a good year!

My bullish case is assigning a reasonable P/S on their e-commerce sales alone. Can easily see $40-$50 in the next 6 months. Don’t be misled by historic share price though. In 2019 management bought back 30% of outstanding shares
No. I will not be part of that bubble. I got some good swing trades and credit spreads over the months, though.

While NOT related to BABA, the tangential drama of ANT can still potentially take its toll further and push down SP.  BABA Bulls will still contend that as a whole its still massively undervalued (wha wha).

Let this bitch circle the drain a little bit more and then grab some near-term calls pre-inauguration and sell the news immediately, and when it gets pushed back down again (IF it does), end of Jan. get some leaps.

Havn’t really looked recently. What I’ve been researching all morning is $BABA and the 224.6Million worth in block trades after the drop
Keep in mind there’s a good chance they may go ahead and start buying back now and lock in those losses for this year
YEAAAHHH
Spacs can go under $10. If they don’t find an acquisition target the capital is returned, but you could be bag holding for years. Seems like a lot of opportunity cost if that happens.
I’ll say it here cause I’m comfortable. Not many know I’m golden gloves. Happy new year to everyone.

Yes.  But the opportunity cost of holding as they wait for a target.

Most of the good spacs looking for targets are 20% above NAV. So if the target is shit you can lose 20%.

You can tell this sub went to shit when people started talking about holding stocks instead of options. This rally plus wsb beginning to appear on the front page resulted in an influx of reddit normies bringing their reddit tier humour and garbage memes being spammed onto the front page. Since new retards don't actually trade and aren't interested in any sentence over 20 words they just upvote memes instead which results in the site being flooded with garbage. Eventually quality of discussion also goes downhill, used to have a bunch of people who would at least give some interesting insight into the financial system but they're pretty much all gone now. Now you have a bunch of new people who only know how buy stocks just talking about the same garbage and the culture just devolves.

I don’t think this is a bad thing as it’s not the worst possible outcome the market was bracing for, notice the market reacted mostly on the news of alibaba probe as ant probe was already announced. The news sources are stating that the probe into Alibaba itself was completed on the day, which means it won’t be a long drawn out investigation. Ant being regulated was already known . The fact that ant isn’t being asked to break up or that alibaba isn’t being asked to break up is positive news. Market cap of alibaba right now is discounting ant altogether .

I see you're thinking ahead by buying dip for your tendies.
Rape isn’t sex.
UVXY has a better correlation to VIX than VXX, but with the 1.5x leverage UVXY also has more bleed down due to contango.  But if a near term vol spike pushed VIX into backwardation then UVXY would benefit more from the term structure.

This seems to make UVXY a superior play to go either long or short shares, but when it comes to the options my understanding is that all the extra movement is priced into the IV meaning that the payoffs look very similar. 01/15 IV for VXX is 109.11 and 01/15 IV for UVXY is 160.05.

I guess it would take a careful study of the the historical realized volatility of VXX and UVXY compared their respective historical option IVs to really know which one was the better option play.  Have you ever seen anything like that?  I can't find anything.
Its pretty simple....we went down too far and then up too far.

A covered call is therefore most profitable if the stock moves up to the strike price, generating profit from the long stock position, while the call that was sold expires worthless, allowing the call writer to collect the entire premium from its sale. https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/covered-call.asp

Aside for Xmas eve 2020, this stock does not move sharply.  All other similar stocks in this sector have mooned.  BABA is bigger and better and not just happy to see you but also still has the world’s largest IPO still in its pants.  
Only reason it looks like China scored an own goal against their biggest champion company is because that is what they want you and American regulators whispering about “delisting” to think.  China is clearing the runway for BABA to  takeoff 🛫🚀and own post COVID globalization.  Total speculation and not to poke the PLTR gayng, but BABA and their tech is largely responsible for tracking and tracing COVID in China making it not just Chinese Amazon, but also Chinese PLTR you stoopid artists.

He just stated the fact that playing with China stock is like playing with fire. That isn’t fucking xenophobia when it is true. In China, the government technically owns all companies and yes Xi can politically oppress any company he wants if it does not abide by their rules. It is a fact and this is not xenophobic. You just don’t understand how things work in China. Stop being naive.

Cool. The math is where it's at! There might be a slight deviation in the math right this second because the option pricing froze at market close while the share price changed after hours. You might consider doing that calculation again when the market opens next. But whatever the math says... do *that*.

I mean you can definitely do worse than ARK ETFs. They’re probably the best around, especially if you want to invest in promising innovation, i.e. growth. 

I do think that when it comes to ARK ETFs, ARKG makes the most sense because it’s catching fresh momentum and yet it makes you less exposed to the risk associated with individual biotech stocks. The rest of ETFs are also good but you can also pick individual tickers from there.

Either get the fuck to wendys so you can make loan payments or say fuck it sorry Lendingclub and drag shit out for a year.  Covid has given them leeway for payment deferral up to a 3-6 month period.

He doesn’t say not to invest. 

He just says to pay off your credit cards before you start. 

From what I understand, 

Stock Gains + Credit Card Debt = Net Loss 

The people he talks to typically are paycheck to paycheck too. 

And while it looks like his “Smart-Vestor Pro” advisors push expensive funds, he says just invest into something that tracks the S&P500. 

So, let’s pretend someone fucked themselves in the early to mid 2000’s, realized they needed a change in 2008, paid off their cards in 2010, if they picked a fund that tracked the S&P500, they’d do pretty well in 2020.
Lol learned this the hard way on this sub back in Aug/Sept

If only this were true- I would have way more PLTR AND GME bags to hold 👊🏻💎
This is correct, also a weeding torch. I use these for my job and they are very fun and extremely inexpensive.
Unpopular opinion for this sub: chart patterns are more than just psychological. And I believe they worked before people knew about them. (I seem to remember watching a video about mathematicians making a lot of money on FOREX in the 70s by just using mathematical models on the charts, no fundamental analysis).

In any case, they do work. Of course you're not going to invest your money on a stock only by looking at chart patterns, it would be stupid to invest in bad companies this way. But if there's a company you've been eyeing for which you like the fundamentals, it's definitely worth looking at the chart patterns to decide when you're going to buy in. Oftentimes you can guess if there's a dip coming, or a gap up, and those things can happen regardless of the fundamentals for the company.

I'd go so far as to say (but maybe this is a little too out there) that just because it's hard to interpret something like this doesn't make it voodoo magic. I'm fairly convinced there is something more to chart analysis than just the psychological factor, and even though we can't really explain why it works doesn't mean it's all random. But that's more intuition than science at this point.

Yes. Go to the “Holders” tab (Details | Holders, if using the app). It doesn’t show what types of positions, i.e. if any of these are short positions, but some institutional holders, like Vanguard Total Market Stock Index, don’t use a strategy where they borrow shares. Individual insiders don’t hold short positions because that would be retarded, since they are granted shares as compensation.

Sooo... twitter drives overall sentiment?
Apple will compete with Tesla in the EV space but one only has to look at how their corporations are structured to determine a plausible outcome.  Apple and their internal marketing teams whom essentially run the company will make a mess of this eventually.  Engineers and product developers get pushed aside all the time in Apple for marketing space. If Apple follows their current corporate strategies this will fail, what you are witnessing is a corporate evolution happening within Apple and if it grows larger then their marketing holds we will see Apple migrate back to its roots of technological advancement.

Stimulus bill bullshit
The benefit of the Roth is that the gains are tax free as well. Turn 6k into 600k in a Roth and you get 600k of untaxed money at age 60. Turn 6k into 600k in an IRA and you're paying taxes on every dollar you take out. The other benefit of the ROTH is "choosing" your tax bracket.  Let's say AOC decides any income under 50k isn't taxed at all and any over 50k is taxed at 50%. You want 100k so you need to take 150k out of a regular IRA and give 50k of that to uncle sam. 
Alternatively you take 50k out of a regular IRA and 50k out of a Roth. Roth gives you options.

There’s a couple catalysts coming up (console sales figures mid Jan is an important one) so there’s still time to make money here. Shorts are already knee deep unlike PLTR when they started shorting. Not a lot available to the shorts and borrowing costs are up over 20%.
Just joking around.  PLTR is a long hold for me.  I believe in its disruptive and parasitic qualities getting into everything.
I get it. For me, I don't want to dedicate all that time to possibly beat out Cathie, when I can just give her my money in 1 second.
Spot on. When i was a poor kid i was always trying to be the smartest guy in the room. Now that i’m neither a kid or poor, I’m always asking questions and trying to find the smartest guy in the room to listen to.
Should have opened the front trunk to a few bags of tendies
I'm honestly impressed that Cramer even went on the show, he had to know that Stewart would roast him. That being said, I feel like Cramer was being as honest as he possibly could be without angering his corporate overlords.
 I've had multiple accounts because I dont want to be labeled by boards I visit. Proof below. I've recently starting posting here because I've gone full retard.

Congrats, you’re above the median. Do you know what median means? Do you know what statistics is? Not everyone can just up and go get an above average income. If they could, it wouldn’t be above average. The working class used to reward Americans with at least a respectable life. Now it’s nothing more than indentured servitude. Meanwhile America has the wealth to ensure a respectable living for everyone who works 40 hours a week, but people like you are too busy being self absorbed.

Spend less than you make is common sense but we also live in a culture where consumerism is marketed/encouraged and used as a panacea for a lot of other problems. We just had a president that said closing down the economy would be worse than people dying of covid. People are dumb but I'm not going to exclude myself just because I'm not dumb like them. We are all pretty dumb in different ways.
1 Distract the masses with idolatry and wanting stuff

2 laugh at them because they didn’t pay attention to what was going on with there money

I think the Biden’s agenda is exactly suitable to re-establish the manufacturing in the US by bringing in more and more immigrants to sub-urbs. Through history immigrants were the only actual solution to the economic recessions in the US, and I am anticipating that the same will happen again. Just bring in suitable immigrants and get the job done with good ol’ Franklins
The problem is all you paper hands will sell way too early when the whole point is to hold as the Shorts have to buy back way more shares than what are available when the time comes. If everyone held the price can go up an insane amount but selling too fast will fuck it up

True, it has never crashed before to my knowledge; I'm pretty sure stonks only go up.
I don't get it? If you bought puts in March you doubled/tripled your money.
I don’t think administration will do anything except for some Sort of reform after a catalyst brings us to our knees (I can see them going frank Dodd 2.0 on derivatives market) .. don’t even see them raising taxes for a few years..

Oh, well I guess I better give up on Tesla if the competition plans on using the dregs of Tesla as their best engineers, lul. They already have competitors who have stolen employees and tech from them. Xpeng stole their antiquated fsd code, and is using it in China. Lucid is using a cadre of former Tesla employees to try and compete. Ultimately everyone keeps trying to use Tesla’s leavings to compete with Tesla... I’ll let you puzzle out how that will work for them.

I did some math on this, if I exercise the calls its $3,660 for 200 shares. If I sold the calls, buying 200 shares at current market price would be $4,062. I could wait it out and hope to sell high and buy low but it just seems exercising would be the safest and most cost effective approach.
But everybody said weekly calls on PLTR was retarded!

Definitely achievable. Remember you have all year, no need to hit a home run first week of January. 52 weeks, with a 6% gain each week, you’ll net just over 100k in the end. Or about 29% gain a month. Godspeed brother.

In those days, I don't know if you were around back then, but it wasn't clear that Amazon would take over the world. It wasn't even the biggest online book shop yet.

For example, Books.com had better funding, a better ne, and was earlier so had a lead in the market.

And there were tons of other marketplaces with various concepts. eBay was actually the big one with millions of users, catering both to the serious sellers as well as bargain hunters or auction gamblers.

Back then suggesting that a niche book shop will overtake them with by makings a b2c website would have wonder ludicrious

That’s like telling me that Nestle Tollhouse just announced they were going to take over the defense industry by 2025 and you better ditch LMT now.

I mean...he isnt being naive and xenophobic.  and Xi could torpedo BABA whenever he wants.  Its well documented that China isnt as business friendly as western countries, which is why BABA trades at a P/E discount to other tech firms.

Think of your losses from a sky-high view. It may seem like a lot gone at the moment, but I'd imagine it is a small amount compared to what you'll earn in the next decade. You made a mistake, don't dread it, learn from it.

I like that it’s a larger SPAC, so less chance of it being some terrible P&D company. I will likely sell IPOF after announcement though and go 100% into PSTH
Doesn’t he have to file to sell with his position at this point? If so he can’t pump and dump anymore, will be dumped before he gets there.
Yo if we start dumping tomorrow I’m gonna wish it wasn’t a full trading day 😖

“that government of the people, by the people, for the people” has become the biggest lie and deception of the current times.  Abraham Lincoln would be turning over in his grave if he knew how our democracy is getting raped by greed, corruption and foreign powers.

Wake the fuck up and don’t tolerate any bullshit from any politicians or the rape or taking advantage of our government and country.  So first things first.

I’ve just got 10 June 25c, they’re down a bit right now because of IV, but I’m hoping as earning approach it’ll start ramping up. 

If it actually hits $30 then I’ll be stoked but anywhere above 25 should print really. I’m hopeful but we’ll see

A vagina is self cleaning.
Brodie we all know you want that rim licked it’s okay
There's a rumor going around that it's Polish. Can't confirm, so if you have anything to add, I'll let you Finnish.
If you actually want the shares then exercising is fine.
Why IPOF tho? Curious
I’ve been watching the free stuff he posts on YouTube (Like this one) for the past 6 months or so and he has said exactly that. 

He’s said something like, “If you ask me for help, I’m going to teach you my program. If you don’t follow it, I’ll be curious as to why not if you’re coming to us for help. And if you feel you have a better method, it’s 2020, start your own show! YouTube and a smart phone is all you need!”
That depends on 2 things
1. You believe the squeeze is going to happen after 1/15
2. Or you believe Ryan Cohen is going to make substantial moves and GME will be substantially higher down the road and maintain that value

Do you trust Cathie Wood with your future?
BA has indicated that there is no reason he won’t meet 6 month target (January) in some past interviews
For all those who this hopefully reaches, this is not your typical SPAC and not your typical reverse merger. Read up on it. Know what you are actually buying if you are grabbing shares of STIC. 

Funny how Sir JAL sees I am posting these in various places, but remains silent. What does he care though, he’s already taken your money on this one.

Good luck to you. Id just rather find gains elsewhere. Ill get my china exposure through etfs thats enough for me now

One more day and you’ll be winning it all!
They have been profitable in fact issued dividends until last year (as sales shrank). But still profitable. More cash on hand than debt even while buying up discounted shares. 

I get it being a value play. Could be $35/share just off its fundamentals. I’m not truly bullish on GME long term because seriously a lot of things have to go right, pretty late in the game, to pivot to a new more profitable “tech” company. 

It’s undervalued yes. But I’m here for the squeeze.  And regardless will go up just on it’s balance sheets so very little down side (share holders but options a lot more risky).

if you google this guy he said the same thing in april except then it was “summer will be the peak and then big crash” and look where we are

If I was Elon I’d fuck all of the women at work after interviews chance they already did. All of the world leaders have all the access to so much women. 

Every president even in our country fucks around and the one before as well. I think that’s the only motivation to even get jobs like that.

yes. even though the sentiment has fallen from the Wed peak, it still an overall \~30% positive sentiment. As for data, I pulled all the posts and comments from  r/investing and r/wallstreetbets for the last week.

That’s more like a slowly descending bear market into volmegedan which happens to me every morning
Except the vaccine protects against that new strain. The majority of the world will be mostly covid free in ~3 months at the latest
I took a 20k hit but then poured 40k into more leaps.  This is the way
I’m concerned with the amount of bullish posts on GME, usually means the opposite will happen
Can happen again. I think it's nonsense too but inevitable. This was a reallllly good run.

That’s just very bad timing. It can happen with every investment. I’m not buying BABA options at the moment for sure. But long term I am 95% confident it is a great investment. More so after the crazy panic selling we saw last week. Great Christmas present for people that didn’t have any BABA exposure
Wait, why?
Not true, he would have still been in the red due to time decay.
The most comprehensive one is in Jack Bogle's book: Little Book of Common Sense Investing. He takes the statistics (publicly available) and runs the numbers. It's very straightforward and will blow your mind.

What is up with all these people eating ass or into anal play? Holy fuck that’s some disgusting behaviour. No wonder ass cancer and gut parasite infections are on the rise.
True but I'd buy some gold and silver just because.
What I meant by tanking is falling sentiment when compared to the previous days. The interest toward's the stock might have slightly decreased after the peak or a lot more negative sentiment would have come from  🌈🐻 which offset the whole data
Unfortunately not gay enough
this is going to be a melt upwards to 40 to $60 between now and April if any kind of crazy catalyst happens we're going much higher.
Long-term bearish yes, but oil stocks will recover from where they are now over the next several months
That’s literally insane. The market crashed in March you melon.

Imagine starting to shit, and you have a spikey poo, and as it comes out it starts getting worse and worse until you're literally shitting nails.
I think we have one more drop down unless they claim they've already caught the infamous hacker known as 4chan. Too much news has happened for anyone to keep pressing coverage on cyber security or logistics. I'd say we're gonna see a nice entry point before demo day, a solid run up aftwards and another BTFD after lock up expo before we start seeing steady upward momentum

Just be smart with your money so you can buy the dip. Because most people here started with RH this year and will lose all livelihood when/if a crash to this severity happens.  Especially because you guys don't know what holding means.

Well, to be fair, it is probably not real... Just robinhood displaying illiquid option pricing at closing. Once the Market opens tomorrow, they'll be back down. 
That's why they need the helmet.
Just remember, 5k is a lot better than 0. Don’t lose.
Lol nope I just flipped flopped it. You're right. I did look it up initially but not carefully enough and now I see the confirmation bias got me when I saw a paper about ILMN's "synthetic" long read technology. Thanks for the detailed breakdown.
Man I don’t know if people truly don’t get it or if they are just trolls trying to discourage participation. It’s really not that hard. Sure, some people are bullish on GME and see this as strictly a value play but most see this as a squeeze opportunity.  Get in, make profit get out. Not difficult at all.
A lot of them are connected with realtors and other industry ppl so they automatically get an advantage. If it’s on Zillow or some shit to be flipped chances are there’s something major wrong with it that the “big guys” didn’t want to deal with. It’s a big club and you aint in it
Yea keep throwing ideas lol, it’s not like I got better shit to do until markets open
I was agreeing until they said 70% down from SPY500. The fuck is that 😂
Equities like TSLA are the new gold. Inflation is going to skyrocket but so will the market. It's easier than ever to move money from bank accounts into stocks to protect against inflation. Can't say the same for gold.

I would not recommend doing a condo as an investment. You have hoa and the appreciation is lower. The numbers depend on buying a property that makes sense not just any property at any price.

i will let someone else post loss porn friday. not this time friend.
I’m thinking about selling my 10k of ARK’s an putting it on arkq 12/22 155c. I’m a lil hesitant cause that would mean my entire RH account would be in options. Icln an Arkq feel like the move though. What do you tards think? Maybe arkg instead of arkq? I don’t like arkg soley for the fact they only go out till 6/21
What calls are you looking at?

My only concern is that younger drivers don’t want an app watching them
Tell that to my jan calls i had the day he actually torpedoed them. Granted that is a black swan. Ive been trading BABA all year and made great money on it. I had opened a large position right before they killed the Ant Ipo losing me about 14k, so dont tell me their gov cant do that.  Also, I have a significant portion of my IRA in EEM so i get my exposure that way.
No

IPOF and PSTH are going to be some legitimate ones worth holding
I should’ve gone balls deep on BFT when I saw their CEO on CNBC last week at $12. They do have a federal investigation over something I had heard about so that could spook investors one of these days. Or not.
not to mention if you have a fallout with a company over a shitty product/service and can't get a resolution/refund, AMEX will charge back almost no questions asked. they don't give a fuck

My best WSB story is around May / June. I was starting to see some success with options so naturally I thought I was a genius. I then discovered option plays on earnings. I put down 5K on Nike Calls before earnings and made a 15K profit. No research; didn't even own Nike outright -- just wanted to gamble. I've been working remote from home and I was super bored and depressed and I remember telling myself I was going to book an Air B&B and work remotely in Hawaii for a month with this money I shouldn't have.... But then COSTCO came up for earnings the following week and I was like "Costco is a company I follow and they consistently deliver performance" -- bam lost about 10K on that deal. Still have 5K up so I call in on NVDA calls, but it was around this time Trump tweeted something ridiculous and it sank the market from like 2-3 PM and my NVDA calls essentially were worthless. I then proceeded to lose pretty much the rest of my account on TSLA calls the following week. So, I never went to Hawaii haha. I now have about 3K I play with in my Etrade in ETF's. I have 2K in my Robinhood. I buy daily reoccurring investments on about 15 stocks outright. And I've managed to trade shares in my 401(k) and increase its value by about 15-20% in the last month. I'm going to change jobs soon so I'll probably move all my 401(k) stuff back into Mutual Funds and only really play with my Robinhood. Lost 1K on SPY options last week and I realize how much options trigger my addictive personality haha. Love this group though. Read it everyday.

STIC now currently under investigation.

This is not going to be a typical SPAC merger, BARK will have its own IPO when all is said and done.

See here... and then do your research elsewhere. This was bogus all along. Sir JAL knew that is my bet.

You are making investment decisions based on your western bias against China. I respect if you don’t invest in something because you feel that you don’t know enough about it. But can’t support your decision based on your wording of your rationale. Xi can’t torpedo BABA at any moment, and you are very naive and uninformed if you believe that

There’s a lot of denial in here.... Chinas GDP has grown x8 since 1980 and just overtook Japan. They are going to overtake the US in 8 years. They are the workshop of the world, and they’ve only just started. If you’ve ever been there and seen the growth for yourself it would blow your mind. 

Militarily and Scientifically as well they are taking huge leaps. We sent a carrier air group through the straights of Taiwan in the 90s... lemme tell you that that won’t happen again.

Sorry if you guys don’t like it, but That’s the trend. We mostly just do service, management, and finance in the USA now... which is great for our fat asses, but not so great strategically. The biggest thing that’s driven manufacturing and production outside of the US is our high labor costs, and especially secondary costs in insurance and union contracts (pensions, etc). Guess what, the PRC has a billion peasants who are happy to work 13 hours a day for $1, in order to move out of a cave and into the city. That’s why all manufacturing has moved there.

China plays by its own rules... boo hoo... guess what, they don’t care and that doesn’t necessarily mean that Chinese companies are not going to make tons of cash. 

They have 5x the population of the US, and an insane work and study ethic... just wait and see.
If you’re worried about it, hope for a revolution or something - but tbh that seems to be more of our problem nowadays. Nobody is chucking fire bombs in China unless they want to catch some 7.62 in the chest.

Hire an accountant and just know that if you fuck up and end up owing a ton, you can make a payment plan with the IRS. You can only have one payment plan at a time though, so going forward you need to sort your shit out and withhold properly. Now, when I realize a big gain on my investments, I go ahead an send 20% of the profits to the IRS using their online payment system. That way, I am not caught owing a huge amount in April. .....an adult could put the equivalent cash in a low risk investment til April, but I  just pay tax as I go so I wont be tempted to play options with my tax money.

This is the worst fucking post I’ve ever seen on this subreddit. I want what he’s having.
What the fuck are you talking about. I have 100% of my portfolio in psth + margin I’m not sure how to interpret your suggestion. I have no more money to put into the play. I’m not gonna take out loans I’m not that retarded. I’ve got my money where my mouth is now why don’t you agree to eat your own shit if it is stripe because you seem so fucking sure.

If there is one company I believe this will be, it is stripe. However, I do not KNOW that and understand that I could be wrong. In the event I am wrong, I still make money on this play. Instead of being a total fucking smooth brain, how about you tell me why you’re so certain it won’t be stripe? I gave you all my reasons. How about you attack the merits of my argument instead. You fucking ineffectual loser.

'I don't see this ending well': A 47-year market vet breaks down why stocks are a 'few months' away from a 75% crash — and says gold will surge to $10,000 because of a tidal wave of inflation

Hunter, the chief macro strategist at Contrarian Macro Advisors and 47-year market veteran, says the S&P 500 will continue to rise to 4,500 into early 2021, but will turn sour shortly thereafter in what will be the beginning of a market crash of "biblical" proportions — 75% from current S&P 500 levels, or 80% from 4,500.

"We're in the final stage of an equity melt-up," Hunter said to Crux Investor's Matthew Gordon during a video discussion posted on December 10. "I've been on the record many times saying that when this top hits — and I think that's in the next few months — it will be a high water mark that will probably stand for decades."

"I don't see this ending well," he continued. "2021, probably not initially, not the first quarter, but I think as you go through the year, you're going to see a global bust, the likes of which will be worse than anything we've experienced in the post WW2 era." 

Hunter said the crash will be the end of a 38-year secular bull market and an extension of the economic bust that began in March this year.

The catalysts for a potential sell-off and bust include things like a lack of stimulus, global debt buildup, or a misstep from central-banks, Hunter said earlier this year.

He said this downturn would lead to a period of significant deflation, which would then trigger an enormous policy response from central banks, with the Federal Reserve increasing the money supply to more than $20 trillion from current levels of about $7 trillion. 

This would then lead to very high inflation, Hunter said, which would cause interest rates to rise and equity valuations to fall.
"The reason I call this a secular bull market that started in 1982 is because that's when PE multiples began to expand from single digits to what's now over 20," he said.

"You're going to see the reverse of that in the next decade. You're going to see interest rates going from zero to 10 or zero to 15 and the multiples going from 20-something back down to single digits." BI
Proof! So I can imagine I'd make so much
This.
Technically only 68k..
Yep, just do a search.
Nobody is recommending you spend YOUR OWN money on this. The strategy is to use someone else's money to do it. Minimal downside, and just collect your check to buy whatever. Boom.

Grabbing emoji sentiment should not be lost on a programmer/analyst. But how to grab and process is the key.
Ive got VALE for march, which might be too early but it's what I can afford without capping with a spread. Probably grab some spreads in June in a month or so
Yup.
Oh, don't you worry. All the government employees that weren't working during this period get an obscene amount of "backpay" because they weren't able to work during that period. We actually end up spending more when government shutdowns are said and done than if the government hadn't shut down.

I know how we can prove it, we can push this for the next board metting.

If we all do some specific action we can estimate how many of us hold shares. For example, we can all just "abstain" on one particular board member. It won't cause him/her to lose but will just give us an idea how many of us hold shares and how many.
Let’s be inspirational people.

But then again you may have only sampled the 🌈🐻 post that have popped up recently since they're all losing money on a massive scale. if you look at the totality of gme you would realize that it's through the goddamn roof.... All of the due diligence suggests we're going to a bare minimum of $40 and if we're lucky upwards of $120 over the next couple of months.

Because it needs work. I agree the GME looks like it’s covered in shit, but it’s just a shit covered gem right now. When Cohen grabs Sherman by the nuts and polishes the shit off the GME brand by representing it as an established gaming brand in the e-commerce space, then it will compete with Amazon. Things take time. It’s not able to do that right now. They’ve only recently changed directions, and Cohen isn’t afraid to take that over completely from Sherman if he doesn’t do it right. You obviously don’t have the vision for GME like most of us do,  it you have to have that for this to work. You obviously have a vision that Sony will keep designing new consoles/cameras/etc. so that’s why you bought Sony stock. I believe in the new management of GME, and you don’t. I’m gonna leave it at that. I hope you short it in confidence. See you after earnings.

You read it right, he edited
Yeah but that shit is honestly like hoping my stocking stuffer lotto tickets are winners lol
im pretty sure a PWS is mandatory in some places
Am i wrong in saying that while Chinas actions against Ant hurt, it no way justifies taking 100B off Baba's market cap at this point?  If it knocks even 50-100B off Ant financials valuation (which seems like a lot even then), and Baba has a 33% controlling stake, it seems like at MOST Baba should be down 30B, and I'd bet even less based on fair valuation
Undoubtedly
What a load of boomer bullshit. Nobody is going broke over an Xbox, if people have the ability to make money to save up they do.

I mean, it is highly likely i am wrong. I was just thinking that since the shares are not actually owning any part of baba, on negative news it is not surprising there was a massive sell off. because shareholders dont mean dick to baba. They have no authority what so ever, they just own a peice of a shell company. so no reason to hold for posturing/company input, when you can just sell and most likely buy back in at a better price

No, say dada.
I started in 2011 at 1.5k  now at 88k stocks only. Not all from gains but I added bit by bit. My first stock was BAC and index funds the next year. I ditched all my mutual funds in 2018 and all-in blue-chip stocks. In 2020 spacs and airlines give me ups and downs.

Definitely possible, but it really depends on each individual market.  I live near a major university (40k+ students) which has many blocks of restaurants and stores all next to each other, and less than a mile (sometimes even just a few blocks) from all the student housing, so it's great.  It may not sound glamorous, but I actually have a lot of fun doing it (I like riding my bike, I also like the challenge of getting the food there in one piece).

That being said, I could imagine many people hating doing deliveries by bike, it really depends on the person.  I wouldn't quit your job, but you could definitely try it out as a side income.  The flexibility to make some extra cash is great.  I make about $30 an hour when active, but I have to wait around half the time.  But $15 an hour when I'm just hanging out half the time isn't bad.  I should note that I live in a major city so each delivery has a +$2 bonus automatically.

I got started by watching this guy called Wilcer on youtube.  He does bike deliveries (he also started using a scooter) in LA.  I thought it looked fun and that's why I started, I even got the bag he recommended and it works great (it is huge though).  If you are interested you can check out some of his videos to get an idea of what bike deliveries are like: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wysGndHVtyc&t=517s

My guess is they purchased a home or property and needed the down payment money.  They leveraged the equity in their existing home for the new one.  Source: did the same thing a year ago, same results.

You can easily put an outward speaker on any car though. I grew up in a honkey ass rural area and my friend in high school wanted an outward speaker so we installed one. It was operational through a CB-type of mic, but also had a CB that he could speak into without it blasting through the outward speaker and other programmable sounds that could play out of the speaker. It's essentially what police have.

I have the same worries but the stock market didn't seem to follow. Small businesses going under may be welcome news to the stock market as small businesses dont have tickers. Less competition. With a democratic house and president they may push for fiscal stimulus. The difference between 2008 and now is the banks will not have liquidity problems. That might make all the difference. Lots of people have been without a job for most of 2020. Stock market doesnt care. Poor people having issues doesn't move the market. Rich people having issues moves the market. The solvency issue may be more of poor people problem. 

Unless there is enough strife that people start doing some kind of overthrow. Government will most definitely stop that either by force or by a stimulus bill. Stimulus would be good for market.

He was actually less leveraged (4:1) than most real estate investors today and the economy turned. Also, his first millions after his crash were from cash real estate flips.

For me this is very very easy, as I said I am in China and NIO is way way better than Xpeng in many ways.
- NIO CEO is a very famous smart ass (we call him Elon Musk of China)
- NIO is doing premium high quality cars (I tried both and I can tell , Xpeng is more mid high range)  
- NIO has a crazy reputation in China because they are more than a brand they are a community, they take care of people they gather people they offers lots of services 
- NIO is ahead in terms of technology (they have many patents) they also control and have a crazy network of charging station (Xpeng is using them)

I bet big on NIO however Xpeng is a solide company, backed up by Alibaba , Xiaomi and they have their own power plant. I would say both have great future but NIO is NIO!

If you treat your credit card as a debit card, in the sense that you immediately pay it off whenever you buy something, the saving can definitely add up. 

The problem is when people who are more inclined to purchase something because the credit card will “give them cash back”, even though they wouldn’t have bought it to begin with. 

I’m in the same boat as you, if you’re responsible, credit cards can 100% be used to your advantage.

One of your better outcomes?! That’s a fat gain. I absolutely took in what you said. I was hoping to get them interested in the patterns, but you’re totally right about the sine wave. They both already have careers picked out that have nothing to do with money, so I’m just hoping to interest them a bit.

I keep GME on my ticker just to watch them slowly die. I follow the gaming industry very closely as it’s a personal interest, and GameStop is not a well-loved brand.

Their stock is trending up right now because of speculation on new consoles and Christmas sales, but they are also massively cutting labor hours in their stores. Many locations had as little as ONE staff present in the past couple of weeks - supposedly busy shopping weeks.

I think they will continue to trend upwards due to speculation, but you will probably want to sell before they announce earnings.
Run.

Possible explanations:

The seller of the put thinks GME is gonna fucking skyrocket and blow past 24 by then. He collects a fat ass premium for being pretty deep in the money. *If* he gets assigned early before expiration he still has that premium and 100 shares of a stock he's expecting to moon past his strike. If he doesn't get assigned he just keeps the fat premium and doesn't need to spend 2400 buying shares.

Buyer buys a deep ITM put and just expects it to drop more from here. Doesn't need to go up then down. It can just keep going down down down.

I'm sure there are other explanations involving spreads and shit but these are the first two that come to mind.
Bill goes away and a new bill has to be voted on. After a time limit. If he refuses to sign

They can override a veto with 2/3s. And then if he still refused to sign it becomes law. But because he hasn’t officially vetoed it’s like a pocket veto. So nothing can happen unless he decides to sign or they come back with 2k.
Stock prediction like this is pretty much always bullshit. You dont know if the line is gonna go up or down, no matter how much you think about birds.
Take out another loan so you can pay off your loan
I can’t say one way or the other about how much money they made when the consoles were restocked, but the fact that there were news headlines and you heard about it says a lot about the gaming community.

RadioShack died because China was able to sell directly through Amazon and the markup on components was too much for some people to pay when they could just order free two day shipping from an online retailer and never leave their house in the first place. 

GME does sell gaming products you are correct, and yes they sell both digital and disc style versions of their consoles, but you’re not taking into account the deal that was made with Microsoft earlier this year, and a possibility of a similar deal with Sony (just an idea obviously i dont know) if they do in fact sell more digital consoles. However, they will not because people like the fucking disc. Gamers want to be able to hold it, trade it, sell it, etc. Most of them just like seeing the box art on their shelf. Regardless, gamers have more feelings of nostalgia with their collectibles than maybe another collector because when you like something that’s completely digitized like a video game having a physical in game item is just that much cooler.

Go ahead and buy your Sony stock. That’s not a bad idea IMO, but saying GME is a failing business is simply ignorant or have no vision for what Cohen can create, and that’s fine. I hope you make money elsewhere.

I'm not saying the Dave Ramsey is bulletproof, it isn't for everyone, but it is designed to minimize your financial serfdom. You can't really look at his plan and say it is a bad idea or irresponsible advice.
Lol the fatties are seething
Hello internet stranger... Been down this road a couple times, several multiples worse than your situation. Some advice to do with what you wish:

1) Acknowledge your mistake and take a lesson and then move on. You’re not going to change anything by “reimagining” what you “should” have done. If you need help with this part, I’d say be brutal and honest. You done fucked up good, gambling with other people’s money. Yes, you weren’t “investing” you were taking a spin on the roulette wheel.

2) Don’t do bankruptcy unless the other option is homelessness. You won’t be able to get a loan for much of anything for a good 10 years if you go that route, plus in my personal option 90% of bankruptcy is for pussies that don’t own their mistakes. Plus, if you’re 20 now, $20K might be peanuts in a few years and you’ll be much worse off when you can’t buy a house with your girl/guy or get a car without paying in cash, etc.

3) Figure out a budget and payment plan. If you’re not going to be able to make payments call the loan originator and explain your situation. Most will work with you and we’re at historically low interest rates.

4) Lean how to hustle. This is the best lesson that came from debt for me. Paint houses, write articles, walk dogs, pick up shit, work a second shift, etc. I have $20K annual in side hustles and am working towards $50K...

5) Pay yourself first. You’ve probably heard this boomer bromide but it’s a bromide because it works. Take a few bucks from each paycheck and overpay your loan and you’ll be out months before schedule. Look to the boomer budget people like David Ramsey or Cathy whatshername... They’re famous because they help people like you.

OR just con grandma into giving you your inheritance early and put it all on black and hope for the best.
That would not make TSLA holdings useless, they would have to give consideration for the TSLA shares such as shares in the new company, and it would have to be done with the approval of a majority of the existing shareholders.
There are these weird things called human brokers where it's like robinhood but you pay money to have a person manage the account for you so that you never have to look at an app. Lot of old people use this service because it reminds them of an old time when stonks operated on the honor system to save paper and you would do trades by walking onto the floor of the New York stock exchange yelling your bids and asks and shaking hands with people. Maybe astronauts use the same kind of thing for when the internet is spotty in space
This cuts me deeply.
You’re already here silly.
What's a put?
That may be true but not for the reasons you think. It's not about "ending a life and suffering" like you said, it's just a difficult task with extreme pay off. You wouldn't believe how heart broken hunters get when they place a bad shot and know that an animal is somewhere slowly dying and suffering. But to me I just think it's weird how people see it as bad even if it is somewhat a sport, it all goes back millions of years. It's like getting mad at a lion for killing for food, I bet they feel good murdering too

Somehow everyday is part of a 3 day weekend for me
Why don’t LGBT activists care about gay people getting killed in Islamic nations? Why don’t feminists care about women having unequal rights in Islamic nations? Why do left wing activists care about Palestinians so much but not Native Americans? It’s all political manipulation in Anglo nations. Don’t believe that it’s meant to be objective.
True, but it’s a behavioral finance question. People who use the debt snowball have a higher success rate than people who use the math method. I got out of debt using the math method, and it’s very frustrating to start with your highest interest debt if that debt is large. You spend months paying on the save $30k car loan and don’t experience a win till it’s paid off. Ramsey says to start with the smallest debt so you experience some early wins and want to continue. It also frees up cash flow in case of emergency.
If I have $1000 in a mutual fund with a 1% fee, and it grows to $1100 in a year..,am I charged 1% on the growth ($100) or the entire investment ($1100)?
If it’s the latter, that’s bullshit

...you’re serious? Yes, people were lining up around the block when news broke that each location was getting TWO consoles. They did not make major cash that day.

Gaming and tech industry is worth a lot, GME is a traditional retailer that happens to sell those items. By that logic RadioShack should rise from the dead end blow the stock market wide open.

Both the new Xbox and PS5 are pushing digital-only consoles, which completely cuts GME out of future sales because people will have to use MS’s digital store or Sony’s.

Most actual hunters I know make it almost a ritual to kill an animal, then they get the entire animal processed and proceed to either donate or eat the meat of the animal. That seems pretty conducive to how hunting used to be done and honors the dead animal.

Do not be fooled by PSTH.  Ackman likes short positions and is a bear.  A bull case for PSTH means he is increasing shorts and his Ackervism.  He may short GME or another WSB stock and will put your money at risk.

We did that at my work and it's awesome.  Every couple of days you had a "weekend".  Got a lot of stuff done around the house.  Except when its your turn to work the real weekend and it's sunny and your friends are out on their boats...and you have to work.  Other than that, its awesome.
Nah an etf called yeet and a sister called gb. Yeet charges a 1% upfront load invests all capital every Monday in naked calls of the top 3 meme stocks of the week. Every Friday morning goes to cash. Gb does the same thing with puts

Never tell a soul until you've really made it. When you've got a nice portfolio and the money constantly rolling in.

Nothing more lame than bragging about gains, and then facing the embarrassment of losing while everyone is asking you about investing as if you're Buffet
I had to Google that I'm not familiar, I'm not military if that's what you were getting at
Edit: oh yeah I forget that my username is the army branch. My dad was one and we always name our dog Sapper so I've always made it my username since a kid
... as a hunter I'm gonna admit, I like the killing part. It is HARD. Fuckers think you walk in the woods and 15 minutes later you drag one out. YEARS went by I didn't bring one home. In my fam we start at 12. I bet I was 16-17 first time I killed a deer.
Sorry guys, you missed the joke. I didn't know roaming was actually a thing. I have never had a roaming charge and my service is $40/month. Using profits from roaming as a reason to buy seemed like a desperate pump and I was trying to make fun of it. Thanks for the concern, but I'm not paying 3 figures for cell service.
Thanks for the DD bro. Despite your lack of essential internet points, you're just providing info about the company to us, and theres not much there to dispute. I think PSTH will be a monster which is why I have a position and its nice to see others promoting it.

Imagine buying stock based off the karma of the person promoting it🤣 That's one hell of a strategy.
It’s actually an advancing company in the growing gaming and tech industry who is completely undervalued. The gaming industry is a 90 billion dollar market where as GME is only valued at less than 1.5 billion. If the company was valued correctly they would probably be worth nearly 5 billion at least which would almost 5x their current stock price. The management is actually changing also as Cohen is an e-commerce god. Have you see what he did with Chewy? (need I say less) Gamestop is actually seeing consoles fly off the shelves and lines around the block at even it’s “BrICk AnD MoRtAR” locations let alone the online demand which you said apparently means nothing which is completely false. 

Short it then if you have such conviction. Have fun filing for bankruptcy like Melvin.
There’s a difference between being satisfied to harvest your own food and killing for pleasure because ending life is fun and causing suffering is fun

The thing is I don't disagree with your opinion GME is going to struggle and needs to adapt. But you need to remove bias from how you look at things. Clearly you hate GME for some reason and are trying to speak for every cx and that's a really bad thought process. When you said everyone hated them I went and looked at subreddits and read some articles to try and understand your perspective. And it seems most people hate their "management" not really specifically the company (those that had negative things to say). 

Also the classic "disc are dead". Remember its not just GME wanting disc to remain. There were also countless people worried about this. Digital seems amazing until there is a Monopoly. If you can only buy a game from Sony store why would they ever discount it early on and lose profits (I think Sony makes 30% and they can also tell companies they can't just put game on x sale as I know developers have complained about not being able to discount games to a certain amount because of Sony)? So now you're paying more for games and have no ability to ever sell or lend to a friend (which many people still do).Without discs there is far too much control in individual companies prices and that's something I don't  like as a consumer. Again I kind of agree with you I'm just trying to show there is more to price and convenience and sometimes you have to look at the other sides perspective and learn from it.
Just remember that you don’t have to make it back the same way you lost it.

CB ON MONDAY SELL SELL SELL
I started at a tech startup in the early 2010s. They IPO'd relatively recently and went beyond my wildest dreams. Net worth is flirting with 8 figures. 

Started slowly diversifying early this year into Vanguard ETFs while keeping some other money to look for other rapid growth plays. I got in on NIO when they were around $12/share (picked up ~30k shares) so I made out pretty well and halved that position. Will be holding the other half to catch long-term cap gains assuming they don't break through my floor. ETFs are doing well enough, on that side I'm mostly looking for stability and dividend income.

Have made several mistakes and lost quite a bit of money during some trades but NIO has made up for it by a huge margin.

China really needs to regulate ANT as a credit institution if they don’t want a ticking bomb in their hands. ANT can kiss goodbye to their 60% profit margins. I expect some sort of capital requirements. And an impact of 20-30% to their IPO valuation. In the end, this is very good for future ANT shareholders. I believe the company will be much more resilient after this

Okay lets clean this mess up.

It depends on broker. The warrants trade on the exchange now. This already happened with the original PSTH units with ticker PSTH.U. In sept, the units spilt into PSTH and 1/9 warrants.

The same will happen with PSTH ticker on merger, in other words, PSTH splits into the new ticker and 2/9 warrants at price of $23.

I don't know if you will have to call your broker. Just email their customer service now and you'll know everything tmr specific to that broker.

In terms of the rest of your questions, they are covered in my last DD. But in brief, the meat and potatoes of the story is that the warrants are exercisable either 30 days post merger, or July 2021, whichever is later. Once the exercise period opens you can buy the shares at $23. You would need capital to buy them yes. You are free to buy and sell any amount of stock at any time, its yours. So yes, you could, in theory, wait for the LOI bounce and sell some stock off to cover the future purchase of the $23 warrants if you had no other capital. Most people aren't going to do this if they are intent on trying to stay in though, because the more commons you hold, the more warrants you get...

Based on my understanding and reading, the cash in the vehicle was $20 per share on IPO, its called NAV or net asset value. That's just cash. Right now the stock is trading at $26 and that's what we mean when we are saying the stock is trading at a premium. Technically in buying a share, you are paying $26 for something that has a cash equivalent value of $20, aka the huge premium, found by dividing 6 by 20 and multiplying by 100 (30%). Of course this is a simple way to look at it because it doesn't factor in the value of the vehicle re: investor list, likelihood of success, incentive, etc.

So that's what you get back in any case, based on my best reading. I think there is technically speak of sub $20 but in reality I think you can just choose to redeem at $20 instead of going through with the merger. 

**The $20 per share is just cash in the account, so its always there.** 

All that to say that this worst case scenario thinking is bananas. Ackman has set up a situation where he has to make a good deal and likely a spectacular deal. Early Q1 is my prediction for LOI. With SPACs (and Ackman has specifically said this), the merger would happen 45 days later or so.
is it confirmed tho ? thought tokopedia was considering a standard ipo instead of spac route.

anything after 55 would be fine for me.
Yep I think a big portion was water weight.

Drastically increased my water intake so I think body stopped retaining as much
Step up bro. I believe in you
Because trump has never ruined anything
I’m bullish about tomorrow. Am I a silly goose?
Date of ban/length of ban/# times banned
1) if I buy 300 shares of PSTH in my Fidelity IRA, and this company merges, how exactly roll I have the option to purchase the additional shares at $23? Will I need to call Fidelity? Will there be a pop-up? How long will I have to purchase? Will that offer expire? Can I sell some of my common (let's say it went to $100) to complete the purchase of additional shares at $23?

2) Why is the floor $20 and not 0?

Thanks
I increased my water intake significantly so I suspect a good portion was finally retaining less water

No, look at the amount of shares, she sold of literally 90%, that's not rebalancing, it's dumping.

put salt and sand, have you ever shoveled a driveway?
absolutely right, i got a good four hours of sleep and woke up with more reason in my body. there’s no way in hell hedge fund managers would let it grow 80% in two weeks. i’ll see about making money on some solid growth stocks like you mentioned, then maybe me and GME can have a nice relationship
Going to look at only contracts which are close to ITM, with either high OI or a high order and only invest in stocks after i do my dd. After all this, lets see if i make $20 back or fuck it up
Everyone is. That's why I doubt we'll reach that level.

FWIW, I think there are plenty of WSB members that are rational but with a small streak of degen.  As I said (I believe numerous times) I cheer for the full-send retard plays that work out and enjoy reading about them, and I suspect others do too.

Cheers and happy 2021.

Nah, market's real fucky tbh. Whole US economy is. When I was losing money all the time I was fully aware of the psychological and mathematical reasons I was fucking myself but the factors creating that psychology were quite outside my control and I literally couldn't stop, as the ruling class intended
The double negative cancels itself out
Apparently your brain is flooded with dopamine when you die. When an animal is getting killed by another animal it’s brain triggers that hormone release, which gives you an unbelievable feeling of happiness and peace. We get that when we die of old age too, so you’ll be happy.

Dumbest thing I’ve heard in a while. Stop spreading bullshit. VIEs are not a problem at all
If the market crashes it will drop by maybe 50% at the worst. So when times are good you have to jump in and make 300% gains to offset that loss. The only losers in the long run are the people that sit on the sidelines the whole time.

A real trader should have at least 1 IB account
Literally not the case at all. Just look at the 2008 crash, there was a guy who figured out it would all crash a couple years early but in reality the crash was a year or so longer than he thought it would be. The resulting premiums he had to pay to banks to keep his puts open nearly bankrupt him
theyre cyberdocking now
Look for fomo surge if BABA hard reverses?
want to buy HR block stock since everyone is a daytrader now but seems too obvious and too reliant on brick and mortar hmmmmmm
\*girl's boyfriend's car
Yes. You are correct. I just wanted to clarify that people wouldn't get 7% as I feel like many more people here understand margins than dividends.
Dude if you know it deep down then have some self control and dont do it. You can make insane returns just by buying options at least a month out on solid growth stocks. We are honestly lucky to have the ability to trade options so just trade smart and enjoy the steady (significant) gains. Gamestop would be the absolute worst to play weeklies on, just look at the last few months it has continuously dipped after gaining strength. Yeah it's gone up over time but it has serious swings week after week. You might pick the right week, but you buy the calls on the wrong day you're getting burned and will probably get shaken out before the next spike.
people (at least this community) can't wait for the Monday opening so that they (we) can pile up a fair chunk of shares once more.

Me too. And if you wanna be smart I would look for ISK account on Avanza, Nordnet or DeGiro. It's very tax efficient even if the platforms are somewhat boring and don't allow US options. However, you can use warrants and mini futures which are similar to options and you don't have think about giving 30% of your profits to the government. If you are fine with high taxes and high fees for a great platform, use Saxo. If you want lower fees but a bit slower deposit/withdrawal and more complicated platform, IB.

I love reading the same over and over again.

Don't stop goys, we'll be friggin rich!
On the real, and ignoring that this is WSB:

The fact that they retired millionaires means they either didn't truly follow his advice or had very significant salaries, to the point that his advice didn't matter.

First, his advice regarding credit card debt is generally pretty solid. The snowball method isn't the most efficient, but it has solid psychological underpinnings for people who can't stick with a plan, and that has value. You can lump high interest rate personal loans in here as well.

There are two main problems with Ramsey, and you hit in them both. The obsession with getting out of debt is a problem because it ignores the type of debt and delays investments for the future. Getting rid of credit card debt and personal loans is helpful. Getting rid of low interest mortgage and car payments is not. And that's because you have a finite amount of money.. Spending your money getting rid of low interest debt means you aren't putting it into an IRA, 401k, or otherwise investing for retirement. And because houses especially are expensive, that can really delay you and limit your retirement options. This also gets at the idea that the market has significant rates of return, typically 7-9 percent. My general advice is to pay off debt that has interest rates over 5% and make minimum payments on the rates below. I've seen others use 4%, which is also reasonable. Those rates build in a cushion for variance in the stock market, because it doesn't always go up, while still allowing you to use debt as a tool.

The other issue, and this is much more minor, is the funds that he peddles. They're high fee, front loaded funds that he presumably makes a commission on. Every part of that is bad. Instead, you should be looking for broad based, low fee, no load funds and ETFs. VTI and VOO, for example. QQQ for the tech sector. ACWI/ACWX for international exposure. There are plenty of others that are easy to find, depending on what you're looking for, but those are big, liquid, low fee funds with broad exposure that would get you market returns while diversifying risks for far less money than you'll spend on Ramsey.
Guh
Nah, loss porn gets more love than gain porn. The dumber the play the more the gildings.

FED will just pump the market with free money.  Trading desk will have more funds for risk parity and leverage.

The market is asymmetrical. Unlimited upside but fixed downside which is why massive liquidity leads to bubbles.  

FED Has said free money is here until inflation.  LEAPs are safer in a bull market.

It's still a dying business. Why should games out of all the retail industries survive?

But as stocks are purely valued on stock price expectations anymore, it's probably $50


There is no difference between OTC pink sheets and S&P 500 stocks anymore. All just a gamble of who can take the most money from another investor.

It's not about private data. That they are already sharing. Their facial recognition tech also helps to find those unwanted Uyghurs. They are very much cooperating.

All this is is a playful spank because they dared to speak up in between swallowing CCP dick.

I think it's hilarious how with most young adults, their first stock is usually Tesla.

Rural Americans actually use their trucks. They have outdoor hobbies like hunting, raising large animals, large scale gardening etc. I purchase 1500 pounds of animal feed twice a month. When my truck was in the shop, I had to do this in my car and it took 3 trips. The problem isnt the true country folks, it is the guys who go hiking twice a year or needed to buy pine needles for their yard and consider themselves "outdoorsmen" so they need a Ford f250.
We’re even trashier than that.  All our furniture is stuff our neighbors and parents gave us.  It’s too much of a PITA for them to haul it away, and I have a truck so they ask us to take it.  Then when people come over they’re like, “hey that’s my old coffee table, couch, etc.”. Instead of buying from Goodwill we are a Goodwill.  🤣

Realistically I think its possible you see the LOI anytime starting in January. I think once you hit mid January you are in danger territory where it could be any day. The other thing is this stock is gunna likely pop this week. It was jumping eow last week and speculation is mounting and FOMO growing as more and people learn about it.

I see $30 in the next few weeks without LOI. As for "too late". If I stumbled upon this I would still buy at $30, which is 50% premium to NAV. The deal is just too sweet and guaranteed to make some money, likely a lot of money,

Get $100 and open an Oanda-account. There you can make 1000 individual trades with $100 and a 1:10 gearing with each trade worth 1 USD. Trade carefully, and after about 100 000 trades, you might have learned a bit about trading. 

About when you have traded 100 000 trades, you should have been able to pay back your loan with a job. Then you increase to $200, do another 10 000 trades. Another 100 and another 10 000 trades......

By then you should have learned the difference between trading and gambling, and could probably start making money trading.

hmm nice had to look up CGTN but its legit. moon!

This whole play, as has been stated multiple times, relies on the CURRENT situation, not the future one in which prices are corrected. Right now steel prices and demand are both high so $MT will have made a killing once it’s time to report  earnings in February, and of course that will shoot their share price up. That’s the point at which you sell your contracts. Don’t sit on it long because the market will definitely correct itself soon after.

It should be an interesting week.  Usually, it would be a low volume holiday week.  I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s pent up fomo demand from the weekend.  If your asking because you want a weekly call, I’d advise against it.  Just buy shares and wait, or sell a put and buy a call for synthetic shares. 

The week of January 11th is when the firework show should start.  The ICR Conference should give a business update.  We’ll hopefully a strategic update that explains why they switched to the technology category.  There’s also huge open interest in the Jan 15 24p.  The puts control 5 million shares, or 10% of the float.  If those expire worthless, I think there will be a market maker that covers a short.  

Don’t take your shot on a weekly this week.  If you want a gamble put it on the week of January 15th or January 22nd.

Um you would have to confirm with WS how they would work that out. But in my understanding, it would be illegal for you to have no option to get the warrants. PSTH is something you have on the app. PSTH has a, call it a fiduciary duty, to inform you of any warrant redemption, for example. You can't legally be in a position where they give you notice but no option to actually redeem.

Anyways, my point is that to be listed as a stock on their platform there has to be a mechanism to obtain the warrants because you own then. This came up with RH users who I think contacted them and they said they get the warrants transferred or something. The warrants may even start trading on WS by then. But don't wait if you want to buy the stock because you wanna be agile if you need to sell them off if this thing goes to $150 or something on LOI.

*For your question, its not a bad strategy. Limited downside and insane upside. If you can just sit on it for a year its likely to double or triple on the LOI alone.*

**Just send an email or call to WS though. Don't wait around. Then come back and post what they said to help others.**

I wouldnt call people dumb because they buy into companies that they know.

an important part of a company's success is branding.

If a company has profit, branding, and is embedded into the economy or consumers life some how, this company will probably do alright. So its not wrong to buy into these companies.

The issue with fundamentals is, its not really something that affects a stocks price directly. It affects buyer sentiment of the company, which then may affect a stock.

A company can have shit earnings and be all around bad, but if there's enough demand for it, itll rise. How the company uses this to their advantage may make or break it.  This why you see companies with huge pe ps pb ratios.

If you really think about it, all companies on the secondary market are over valued. youre paying some multiple over their book value, earnings, or sales because you think itll translate into other people buying in later.

for instance, using pe.  company A earning $1 with a pe of 10, is the same value as  company B with a pe of 5 earning 2.

There difference is sentiment. people believe company A has growth ahead while people believe company B is leveling off.

Whether its TA, FA, or w.e you follow that leads you to buy stock, the indicator with the most followership js whats going to drive the stock forward.

Sweet.
You dump them so you can buy the dip. Its all part of the game
You're also not charged the full margin rate either. At 2.5% that means you pay .0069% per day. 


If you bought 100 shares at $30 on margin tomorrow and sold on exdividend date you would owe $3.13 for margin interest. You would also collect $56.25 in dividends. Clearly a good trade off.


The real problem is exactly what the person you responded to said. How it performs after record date, the percents in this case don't matter because they are correct on a yearly basis (7.5% dividend and 2.5% margin rate) which is the same as saying 1.875% quarterly or .625% quarterly, which is also still the same as taking the dividend all the way down to daily payments like you are charged on margin. You would receive $.6 per day in dividend and pay $.21 per day in margin interest per 100 shares at $30.

Ok. I did outline that the AstraZeneca vaccine was trialed in the UK while this new strain was breaking out in the UK. Their vaccine tested 62% effective in like 10k people. Every other covid vaccine showed 90%+ effective. But wait, AstraZeneca vaccine also tested 90% effective in a sub group of 2k that got a "half dose." Hmm.. so if the 2k had the original strain that makes sense. and if the larger 10k group had a large mix of new strain, that makes sense. They started testing for the new strain back on Sept 1st, and places like London are >50% new strain. No way the AstraZeneca trial avoided this strain.

I’d like to see some type of estimate of what % of GME shares are owned by r/wallstreetbets.  With 1.7 million followers and an unknown number of lurkers, it seems like with the number of posts, along with some of the larger holders, that 20 million shares (including call options * delta) isn’t an unreasonable guess.  There’s only about 70 million total shares outstanding with about 50 million as the float.

So you would rather weaken the dollar.  And the stimulus not be spent in America on its people and infrastructure. And you are justifying money be spent on missiles to kiII children instead. Yes absolutely makes sense on your morality and what’s better for Israel. Stimulus is for American economy how does Israel buying weapons and giving then 1/2bn help the american economy and people?

I don’t know what type of aural sorcery Dave Ramsey used, but however he explained it, she understood. So while she still has some credit card debt, it’s manageable, and we’re FINALLY working together on finances. For our entire relationship money was a battle. Now it’s a success story.

Anticipation:  Monday > Christmas
I know how to read: “the proteins on the UK variant were 99% the same as those on the prevailing strains, and therefore BioNTech had “scientific confidence” its vaccine would be effective”. Why would I bet on the 1% chance it’s not effective? Don’t be dumb. Sure, have some cash on the side. But please look carefully at the odds
$ZOOM definitely not $ZM
This is the way
[removed]
The lol was implying sarcasm, anyway the virus has become more contagious that’s it. The vaccines are still effective, nothing relevant points to the contrary. The above is fakenews
this week yea
Work. I sell honey bees, queens and equipment both interstate and off road.  ‘17 Ford eco boost f150 20+mpg pulling up to 2 1/2 tons but yeah I understand truck douchers can blow me
Try reading. clearly says **“We don’t know at the moment if our vaccine is also able to provide protection against this new variant”**

If it's cause the proteins are 99% the same, why does the PCR test fail to detect on one of the proteins for the new strain?

"One of the mutations in the new variant affects one of three genomic  targets used by some PCR tests. This means that in those tests, that  target area, or channel, would come up negative. “This has affected the ability of some tests to detect the virus,"
I can see that, but hasn’t this been the largest bull run in history or some shit? I mean, even I can see that we’ve exceeded the predictions over the last 4 years. That kind of circumstance just doesn’t happen on the normal timeline. 

Not talking shit-don’t get me wrong. I was simply never taught about money, and I’ve worked for all I’ve got. I’m now ready to make moves, but can’t shake that threat of losing it all because I worked for it instead of it coming from gains. I want to make the right decisions (and I don’t think it’s in mutual funds) but just don’t know enough yet.

While that may be partially true, CC companies charge transaction fees to the businesses, so even if everyone on earth paid their CC bill on time, the CC company would still make 3% of every CC transaction.

Retailers just mark everything up by 3% to accommodate this, so if someone is in the “I only pay with cash” group, those people are subsidizing the credit card companies without getting a single thing in return!  Those are the folks losing the most, but that’s the price one pays for not being able to budget.
I mean take a loan to invest if you know you can at least repay it isn’t bad... it would be interesting how he managed to lose it all, probably options

Lol. They said they haven't even tested it and testing would take 2-6 weeks. So how can it be confirmed?

Wonder why number is low? cause doesn't work on participates with the new strain.

I didn’t really understand till last year that there’s only three ways to make real money in this world: own a business, own a real estate portfolio, own a stock portfolio. Stocks were the most accessible to me.

So I did some research and started putting the majority of my savings into a taxable brokerage account. WSB sucks 90% of the time for real advice but there is good stuff here and there.

I ended up making more in stock gains this year than I made from actually working last year. The real goal is to have the majority of your income be passive (not from working but from your investments)

My big stock winners this year were TSLA, ENPH, SE, SHOP, PLUG, etc.
Just like the top comment says, Dave Ramsey is for people that are in massive amounts of debt and don’t know how to take care of their finances. He’s really good at getting people out of debt as aggressively as possible but post debt there are other people in his network (Chris Hogan) that are more focused on retiring early and stuff
Jan $20 calls, July $30 calls, 100 shares LETS GO
Save your cash for a couple weeks from now when they announce the vaccine don't work on the new strain and lockdowns certain cause new strain is so contagious. Keep an eye out if you suddenly see airlines and travel selling for no reason on no news. It's coming.

I do believe the move in 🪙 is not that unusual for late market rallies where you see speculation in offshoots of the equity markets start to heat up. Surprised to not hear anyone point out that similar moves happened in late 2017 and early 2020 when speculation in stocks was extreme just as it is now or at least allow for the possibility that perhaps such a move coinciding with an extremely overheated stock market might just be more than coincidence? Nope they would rather attribute it to diminishing fiat or people realizing 🪙 true value now after all these years or whatever the fuck. Yep, total coincidence and has nothing to do with rampant speculation in anything that moves.

I used a line of credit this year instead of cashing out stocks. My portfolio went up 300% In last 6 months.

Absolutely! Tesla has so much potential for future revenue, not only in growing car sales, but also in software! Insurance! Solar! And I gotta say, Ive sat in one of their cars and as a huge gearhead (Loved big displacement and large cylinder engines) I was absolutely fascinated, so much power in a car that is practically silent.

 A future where many governments are moving towards clean(er) energy is a place where Tesla will flourish.

Their products basically sell themselves, they can tap into so many different markets, the question is just whether they capitalize on those opportunities.

Add to that, people just love the stock. I only expect their stock price to rise along with their market cap.

Everything dumped in March, nothing was safe. My gold and silver futures were in shambles. It was a very special situation. Things got so bad for bytecorn that it was really supposed to die that day.

He is 100% against using credit cards or any debt of any kind other than a mortgage. Any person with an iota of self control / financial literacy could use debt and credit cards as a tool to make more money (reward points / leverage) but Dave Ramsey’s core belief is that debt = bad. It’s a super reductive and wrong viewpoint IMO. I’ve interviewed to work for his company before and their religious devotion to Dave Ramsey’s financial teachings against credit cards was bordering on culty. ( they discouraged walking in the building with a credit card in your possession among other things)

Really hard to say unless you know what the money went into instead. If what they bought with the money went up even more then there's your answer. Sometimes to buy something you have to sell something. You don't have infinite cash reserve. Just cause something is sold doesn't mean it's garbage.

For sure. BABA will come out even stronger from this. Regulation in China is years behind Europe and the US, this was due for a long time. ANT will IPO with 2/3 the initial valuation, due to capital requirements, but it will be a sustainable business, unlike before, a credit bubble that could pop at any time. This will not make a dent in BABA profitability long term due to Cloud growth. Roll it out 12 months and you will be very, very rich.

This all sounds like things that they really dont care about. Seems like a big show to make it seem like everyone did their part to makes sure BABA is on the up and up. But I agree another dip is possible. Might slow roll my calls.
I got engaged recently (did not post on WSB about it WTF) and a number of people I know genuinely believe it is a bad thing. I get it, ball and chain blah blah, but I'm actually excited and my fiance is absolutely a keeper. I waited 5 years to propose, just to triple check though.

Fake news on TV constantly. Hard to invest when you have to deal with lies. MSNBC this morning reports straight up, "they say all these vaccines work just as good on the new strain." No, they specifically said there was no "evidence" it wouldn't work, and the reason there's no evidence is cause they haven't done the testing yet. Now that Orange is gone, they don't care about fact checking or making up science now.

In my opinion the current market value does not at all reflect the positive headwinds from the console cycle, as well as the current transition. Many expect, that positive Q4 earnings will come as a suprise for many investors and is not reflected in the current valuation. 

Overall at core the Gamestop play is currently betting on Cohen making that ugly duckling into a beautiful swan. My core argument is, that this duckling is valued so cheap, that I would be fine owning it, even without the transition.

That’s not the point dude. I’m not talking about how the war was won I’m making a point that the nazis were working on an atomic bomb because they knew of the possibility of one due to many european scientists cumulative work such as Planck and Einstein. Einstein knew they were working on figuring out how to make one at the university of Berlin. Don’t fight me on this I know my shit go look it up if you don’t understand lol. They found uranium that had undergone fission in nazi labs, there’s a lot more evidence That would take me too long to type and you could just easily find it yourself.

Where in eu are you? Tastywork has pretty fast approval. IKBR is pretty slow but they will not fuck up your deposit and is very secure. Another option is Saxo Bank. They offer US options but they are expensive. Top notch platform, execution and research though. Or, you could buy warrants. They are similar to options. Or... Just don't be a retard and buy the stock.
My parents were at one point really into Dave Ramsey until they realized they didn’t need his advice whatsoever. What they taught me is this:

A lot of his advice is about paying with cash so you can’t get into debt, how to get out of debt if you are in it, buying cars not leasing (way more financially responsible), buying what you can afford which is easier said than done, and generally living a lifestyle that’s accustomed to your paycheck. This is just covering the very surface but if you are shit at money management he gives a great foundation to work off of. As seen above though, if you are wealthy and already don’t spend money like a retard his advice is useless.

A price hike at this point does not necessarily mean they are profiting. They are basically levying more transport charges on the exporters from China as there are not much imports coming in but the containers have to come back one way or another. That being said, they can manipulate the prices to charge more at some point. Too volatile at the moment.
As someone who’s actually German and paid attention in school it wasn’t nuclear bombs nor the threat of it that defeated the nazis. It was pretty conventional war by allies, mostly Russians.

I work as a software engineer in germany. Mostly doing e learning portals but they have payment gateways. All these mother fucking projekt idiots wanted me to implement wirecard for them and i hated it. It was so bad and it was clearly going downhill and these fuckers even bought into that stock. That made me joking around shorting wirecard to my bosses who didnt want to hear that this company will not make the year. I could see that they will purposely miss every fucking deadline 2020 and so i wanted to short it. But i have no margin and i bought like 5k derivates from investment banks 3 weeks before the crash happens. That was my first 10 bagger (the timing was wrong and i had no clue what i am doing there). In this time i found the german board who discusses this shit because nobody here cared about wirecard enough.

Next plays were tsla and alibaba and i made a shitton of money to loose right after that. Still thousands percent plus. Happy to be on board now.

His philosophy also doesn’t allow you to own credit cards, as you can’t be trusted to pay them off every month.

Well, to make you feel better, the open interest for that contract right now is 338; $155k, you probably own three contracts. Get one more and you will own more than 1% of open interest.

hi 🚀🚀🚀
Yeah but my point is he says “income matters LESS than your choice of IRA”, this is the point that’s just out of touch with reality, his initial amount of money is literally all that mattered what type of savings account didn’t mean much lol it was like 99% depending on his initial investment and 1% on any account he used. Many people post 300% returns here daily and don’t feel the need to post a 2 page thesis about their genius methods thinking that it’s that that made him money and not just having a lot of starting capital lol
Gang Gang Gang
I think when someone sees that much money and never saw it say one year ago. One's first reaction is "how do I make more?", followed by "how can I blow just a little of it for FUN!?" House is probably the last thing on his mind if he already has a roof over his head. It requires long term commitment, not the kind of commitment someone who scalps with $500k calls looks forward to.

Personally, if I have that much money, my thought would be towards "how do I not lose it all?" and "what can I do to help others?"
Its boomers being comfortable but also incredibly jealous of us who have to play the risks to get hard gains.  Boomers loathe others who succeed

So you’d rather him not make it and the nazis have it first instead? Lol you’re so one track minded. No matter if he made the bomb or not it was getting made someone. Technology is part of our evolution now. It’s just the way it is, there’s no point trying to hold on a pessimistic view and avoid seeing the many positives of it. As a doctor I can tell you technology has saved more lives than the atomic bomb has destroyed by many magnitudes. Think about that one there bud.

market closed tomorrow ?
I bought 1k shares of pltr at 26.60.  If pltr hits $500 in a year i guess i made some profit.  Feel like a dope for buying it high.
Join the army bro
Man my model 3 got this update but I haven't had time to mess with it
You guys are hilarious. This stock is easily mooning to the $100’s in months time.
Smashing your girl, I do that shit pro bono
You are too young to know.
this may be another u/analfarmer2 in the making
Well its not flamethrower actually....
~Continues to hit Joes blunt...
I only opened a position on Nio recently, I started out with mostly Nvidia and Tesla, sold Nvidia for a nice ~60% profit and bought Nio along with Xiaomi.
all that just to say stonks only go up....
Did she say yes?
I’ve heard from buddies welding makes a shit ton of money. Could go to welding school.
Exactly... and GME isn't worth 1 billion.  So back to wondering how tf it's 20 per share.
OurPillow
any mgni gang here?
Either way, he's screwed.
How did people do this this year?
Thank you for flagging an underrated comment.

Unfortunately, on this occasion your concern was unnecessary and the comment was rated accurately.
Go learn how to weld.
It might there is 1000+ companies that will benefits or lose from this, mt is for the wsb retards, with just a little digging you can find the gems that are not already priced in
How so??

Did any of the regards here get in on Kodak  edite it blew up that one time ?
Some pos investor told me to I cant yolo on calls bc its not professional lmao. Hes a fucking chump bro. I've doubled my money on yolo a shit ton
Just play spy weeklies peko
Gonna get diddled by Omar Baba at open
The answer is simple. He said it was wrong and shouldn't have been done, and his contribution was a mistake.
Fair enough. It’s just retarded. The guy is an obvious fraud, but he keeps trying to defend himself for 12 minutes, while the interviewers are starting to get angry.
Lol wtf? That’s retarded. Peice are on the rise because there is less worker? Lmao, price are on the rise because of increased demand, that’s 101. Supply was also affected so I understand your point, it’s not about workers, but more about upcoming infrastructure bills that comes with upcoming stimulus plans
👀👀
Whether he regretted it or not doesn’t matter. The man did what he needed to do, he chose the lesser evil. Don’t try to pick into it too hard the answer is simple.
Is it not a $hitcoin anymore?
Some shit will absolutely plummet but indexes will stay mostly flat. BABA is fucked but will find a floor somewhere that it stays at til next news drop. Tesla hits 640 then closes \~652. ARKG moon at open into 10:30am dip then closing week at 109. SPY and DOW up less then .5%, QQQ down .3%
if he bought all stocks, he could have $110k today
Because a stock can tell if you are white or not?

Nothing stopping you besides yourself and you clinging to victimhood.
Saying false statements doesn't make them true. The world is not less polluted according to science.

Iran and North Korea are nuclear threats, as well as all the other countries with arsenals.

Red. Arbitrary. Also I believe all the GME newcomers will get smoked by the stock pulling back. It's classic WSB, idk how you can expect anything different.
You do realise MT is an European company? 

If you can't figure out how to buy it in EU you're actually retarded.
Stop trying to find the fucking ADR on NYSE and search for the actual fucking MT on Euronext.
ban?
Could evolve into cup and handle
Is that why he regretted it and said it was 100% a mistake?
Calls on ZOOM? I'm in.
The world is less polluted than it was 40 years ago.

We are also at less of a risk from nukes than 40 years ago.

Ford x1 soldit immediatly... it went up 33% since then
100% do it bro
I hope they close the bank you received your loan from...
Thanks Cookie Monster
Thank you very much for your hard work. I’ve been on the fence about this once and your DD convinced me to get in. Hoping for stripe, but regardless of what the target turns out to be, I suspect I’ll be profitable.
Damn son. Consider that stolen.
Einstein helped build the atomic bomb because he knew the nazis were too ya dingus. He warned the president about this. Albert Einstein honestly saved the world from the nazis and many people will never realize this.
Sounds very gay and fun. Alright, I'll get those tendies for us.
Ah ok, danke, dann eher doch nichts fuer mich. Viel Erfolg!
Do y’all think that people who want to maintain stake in the soon to come Chinese growth would possibly take their money out of BABA and put it in something like NIO? Could BABAs dump be the pump of NIO?
Maybe he's a long time lurker who knows
Elon's holding company, X.  If you buy it for the ticker symbol why not use it for something useful?  He needs steel for Tesla and for Starship anyway.
You pay quarterly and at EOY you look to offload any losers to reduce gains while avoiding the wash rule by using LEAPs if you want back in within 30 days.
These guys made their money and are now pulling it out to protect it, but they also don't want us making money while they sit on it and hope for a big crash...boomers are so fucking selfish and miserable.

Market cap is $3.7B.  Elon can just buy US Steel and make it the holding company.  Keep the ticker, rename the company X.  He needs stainless steel for his Starship anyway.  Buy X while it's cheap, $16.79/share.  Bringing back the old school.  Elon is the new JP Morgan.
Lol you realize I have absolutely all the time due to covid and will just keep this up forever right? 

Trolls are lame. Be cooler.
I really disagree with the holding you back part.

I have been day trading CLX the past month, probably 2-3x a week. It moves between $199-205 over the past month and change.

On the one hand, you have some analysts that say the PT is $250. On the other, CLX was trading at $165 pre pandemic. CEO said he doesn't expect revenues to keep up after the pandemic. Look at almost all companies who were "one hit wonders" (tanker gang back in March, VIRT, and probably steel gang now (don't shoot me, this is just my opinion)...market is forward looking. Even assigning at 20-25% increase due to COVID, that would give CLX a price of $198-206...exactly where we are. Their organic sales jumped by a little over 100%...from like 4% to 9%. But again, this is short term. However, I think you have two sides here, which makes this an excellent day or swing trade. One side thinks CLX is gonna blast off to $250. The other think it's going to come back down to $160-170. The likely scenario? It stays where it is for a while, with minor increases or decreases along the way (we may see increases to $210-215 or decreases to $190-195). This presents a good opportunity.
It s a blast. Party till 9 in the morning . Now go make some money so we can buy our drugs

I just realized I made enough gains myself to buy a Tesla this year. The only reason I didn't realize this sooner is because WSB has eroded my sense of money through all the massive gains and losses posted here that the price of a Tesla seems insignificant now. O\_O
I don’t get it. I went down a bit then popped back up. After 12 minutes I expected more😒

Keep fighting bro.  Don't let the losses get you down.  Keep trying but maybe instead of FDs buy some leaps and if they start to move against you sell poor man's covered calls against your leaps to get some capital back.

I haven’t been to GameStop in years. Just saw a nearby one was closing and picked up a ton of used Xbox360 games.

Guy said it was the best performing store in the area but corporate landlord was jacking up the rent and they had to close the store.

Not sure I understand their competitive advantage without the stores.

Looks like they haven’t had positive earnings since 2018. Earnings are the best price catalyst.

Chart wise it’s way overbought on the weekly and monthly. I’m sure it could go higher but guess that’s being driven by momentum and short covering right now?
They are just still not profitable enough. But then on the other hand any stockpicking and you will for sure lose everything.
I ask my wife.  She loves those...

Ouch, the opportunity cost connected to this stupid decision is going to bite you. Extra hours working, fun activities missed and money diverted from future investments in favour of your loan. 

Well you know what to do next, take out a second loan. Lol
Because ShHtToOcCz OnLy GoE uPp, or another reason?
I very much disagree with that. Investing CAN be a fun hobby. I've always enjoyed working with numbers and had mathematics-related hobbies. I see the fact that I'm having so much fun trading stocks as a blessing. 2020 has been a rough year and most of my other hobbies were put on pause because of lockdown. It's been nice to have something to do other than watch youtube videos, plus I'm better informed on the news than I ever was before. Investing shouldn't feel unfun just because it's supposed to be serious.
Boof it

When I picked this monitor I think I didn’t realize how much 32” was. We can chock that up to poor planning.

However I enjoy the use of a bigger screen with certain programs that have extended widths and control panels. Also incredibly nice for larger spreadsheets. Multiple windows.

I don’t need 32” I just think matching would be more aesthetically pleasing on the eyes. Option 3 exists for the very reason that 64” is a lot lol. 

Plus later down the line I’d like to have a split system where one actually doubles as my tv because I no longer have any desire for a actual TV inside my space.

Zoom has more competitors now than they initially had, with big tech basically have their own video conference options. Plus they have removed the 40 mins time limits with no ad revenue. And to put a nail on the ⚰️, they are in bed with communist China. Short this bitch !

Yeah but then we talking about different shit man. You can attend a 4 day Tony event for $600, that's fact. You can also drop $60k and end up in Fiji at his business mastery course where he shows you his house and shakes your hand. I went to his business mastery course in Fiji fwiw

There is a serious problem on this sub of fairly new accounts posting unbased shill as DD and then deleting their accounts soon after. Where are the mods?

They are already here
Fuck I hate being a europoor, optionsprofitcalculator says if I used $100k to buy June $35c and this hits $60 I would be able to retire at age 26!

But the brokers here don't offer options trading in NYSE. So only choice would be to open tastyworks/IKBR account. However, not only would that take 1-2 weeks to get approved, it also seems very tricky to fund it. Idk about how safe it is, what if I mess up somewhere during the transfer and the money gets lost in the way?

Fml, I'll have to resort to shares instead but if MT reaches $50-$60 then holy shit I'm going to feel sour!
Make your loan payments, retard! 

And take the lesson.
The mod we need, the mod we deserve
I'm a director of a non-profit... we're in desperate need of a grant...
Yes you should do that. Also, at 200k income, thats something like 70k to income taxes, so you'd definitely be paying your share...
Brother, as someone who was poor as dirt for a long time and now has come upon a bit of a windfall of 500k, worry about improving yourself first, getting money later. You're in your fucking prime my dude, utilize that shit and trust the money will follow eventually

Now, what position are you going to take on it?
What if the have?
It still went down.  Definitely belongs on WSB
My friend is currently getting a software engineer/IT degree and said hes enjoying it. It’s definitely an option for me.
To be fair though Lavender, sure he made it sound easy to prove his point, putting 200k into IRAs in a couple years. However, to prove your point, you used stats that really dont relate to the target audience. Yes, according to google, 30% of Americans have less than $1,000 saved and 45% of those have no savings at all. Well it should be pretty obvious that this advice isnt meant for those 30% of americans. I highly doubt very many people without a savings are YOLOing any options on robinhood to try and get rich. There is a greater chance they are using scratchers or heading to the casino for that..................... And how many people without a savings do you think are subscribed to r/wallstreetbets?
If Einstein spent all his time yoloiong on pltr leaps and posting on WSB world would be way better

The funny thing is is that i genuinely felt relieved when my boss told me to go home, like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I’ve been putting it off for awhile because i hated every day of it, just never had the energy to look for another job because i already had one. Now for the yolo’s- the day before i got fired i spent $500 on MT june calls but I personally wouldn’t consider it a yolo because June is 6 months away, so i have time to find another job and get back on my feet, I have one more paycheck this coming week to give me some time to figure out where i’m gonna work.
It’s all a joke right now but I actually would invest in the WSB ETF
My situation applies to mechanical engr. specifically. If I had to redo it again, I'd probably do something with software.

Started with individual stocks years ago, made some money but not that much more than index, so swapped to index etf a couple of years ago. Life was hard but enjoyable. Things got more rough, took to riskier investing as a coping mechanism. Made like 30% in a couple of weeks, moved more of my money over, plowed most of it into GME in a hope of escaping current circumstances.

Noticed that not enough people have said this but let me be the one to share this with you.. 

There is going to be nothing easy till you are willing to slog to make it easier for you.. You want a relaxed life going fwd, youll have to work your ass for it.. as someone who had to do a lot of soul searching and is still doing some.. you gotta figure out what you like, then take some efforts and then double down on those efforts. 

I also firmly believe there is nothing easy, if you like something you’ll likely find it easier and more enjoyable only because you wont mind putting in the hours.

College is your personal choice, Id recommend college for anything IT/Finance because that shit pays well after college.. everything else, there is a lot of amazing advice in the thread below. 

And with that I wish you good luck and I hope you figure it out soon♥️

Merry Chrimbus
He has a couple different types of accounts, not sure if they’re all called IRA’s but anyway, with a ROTH/SEP and solo-401k. From googling it lt says you can put 57k per year into the SEP and solo-401k, so that would be 114k in 1 year for them 2 accounts and 200k+ in 2015-2017 for 2 years which is what I assume he did. I think them 3 accounts can have ~120k per year added between them although I’m not American so I’m just going off what google says

I did an internship in a large pharmaceutical company. Part of my job needed me to understand clinical trials.

Whilst researching I came across a news article about a company whose flagship product failed to get FDA approval, which tanked the stock 60%.

I looked into why it failed to pass and it turns out the drug worked brilliantly, they just hadn't provided the right type of evidence to the FDA. The market had reacted to the news, not the reasons. So I was sure that within a month or two they'd re apply and pass. And they did and I made more than 100% by just buying the dip.

From then on I followed pharma stocks and looked for the biggest losers on any given day, researched why and might then buy.

I had gains net gains of over 40% in the first 2 months, which led to my longer term interest.

This was in 2016. I'm actually still bag holding a few of them that never recovered.
MT, GME and PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀 2021will be great
the pitch: you want to make a biofactory where GM bacteria shit out raw materials like a taco bell soda machine. AI/deep learning are going to revolutionize genetics so it's worth a minor. If you goto college with this as your plan not only will you seem impressive and driven but you will probably bring in a ton of pussy.

GME buying steam
LOL this guy! Ow oww
I got carried away when I put in a couple hundred bucks and saw a 1000% gain in one day during the crash. Doubled down because I thought this was an easy game and I tried swimming out and put myself in a bigger hole. I told myself I’d stop when I made everything back and I got really close but ended up losing it all. I’m in my early 20’s and I’ll bounce back stronger.
I'm rude to them, you can be, too.
I’m just tired man
They don't teach that in school!
Oh you dumb fuck
Problem is that most studies will get you a mediocre pay. That mediocre pay + debt + the fact that houses in places you would actually want to live are very fucking expensive will make that the few tendies you made with this wonderful construction will probably be pissed away on a high rent because you wont be able to buy a house straight away. Unless you dont get a GF and buy a shithole in a place like friesland.

I trade on Wealthsimple and it says they do not currently offer warrants. So how does this work for me if I were to buy PSTH. I would lose out on the ability to exercise warrants but I could still hold the shares and the ticker would automatically change ? 

I don’t have much money. About $5.6k usd available. Is it worth to just dump all that and hold for a year ? 

Sorry new to investing.
Buy the dip.
It's true... Either this or create spreadsheets for work and this is more entertaining.
Money in the game.  Pump it so they can get out before you do.

How do you sort by Live? I dont see that option?
Need an opinion here. Considering a second monitor. First is 32in working off a 13” MacBook Pro. Desk is 52” in width.

Option 1) Get second identical monitor and mount vertically on top each other in the center of the desk.  

Option 2) Get identical monitor and mount horizontally together and split the over hang. Monitors width is 28.5” so each over hang would be 2.5” 

Option 3) Get identical monitor but smaller size and mount horizontally together with zero over hang off the desk.

I am responding to a dude that is talking about how tech has been doing over the past decade and how they will do over the next. I don't give a shit how poor yours or any other tards' reading comprehension is.
You have to do some self-reflection. Who are you? What do you like? College is not for everyone, but you can use it as a tool to achieve your goals. Don't spend years of your life studying something you don't enjoy, then spend more years working in a field you don't enjoy. I understand you may have to do those things to get ahead, but have a plan and use those jobs as an aid, not an end-goal. What is your passion? You'll learn those skills faster because you're not forced to wake up early to study or work.
I knew it was based off of real life.

"I expect a big sell-off to follow soon. Initially, I think we could see  a 15% drop but ultimately I am expecting a decline well in excess of  50%," Hunter said in an email, **like a total cuck** **in 2013,** **just a few minutes into the longest bull market in human history**. "I believe the global economy is  continuing to move toward a recession, one that will ultimately be very  deep due to the enormous leverage in the system."

Once things change in your life, other people/things will bring you happiness. You can see it as a passion. I dont think its wrong to see it at that way, my personal opinion.

I had a handful of 0.02-0.03 weeklies that turned into 10.05 hulk contracts in two days. EV craze baby. Of course I sold early for a lame 10x profit.

But then I did it again with the Steel squeeze like a week later in Nov hitting a 20 bagger on those sweet 0.02-0.03 contracts. Learned to hold some all the way to expiry

&#x200B;

What got me started on these was the GME rocket on MSFT announcement, 100% unpredictable 40 bagger that turned my $6 into a weekend. This was 100% blind luck but the other ones I literally just followed hype in the sector and I'd like to hear someone honestly tell me that 0.02-0.03 isn't undervaluing the chances of weekly >4 standard deviation moves in some sectors of 2020

You will lose money by investing in anything other but technology. Its the next evolutional leap for humanity. Every fucking thing will have a chip inside sooner or later. So your arguments are moronic and big tech is only in its begginings.
I’ve seen charts that there will be a few rises, first occurred setting into $23 range, next will be between now and feb to see it soar past $25 and stay, last march-June earnings will catalyze to $30 and beyond 
June calls are obvious winners anything under $30
March calls same thing but $25 will be good
Anything sooner good luck have been holding MT $25 weeklies throughout December into New Years hoping for a rise and am down 90% but if it shoots this week I’ll be positive still,

Big companies take over underpriced assets at inflated costs during high dollar inflation. That is why you’ve been hearing about m & a. That’s why you want to be invested in small cap tech, just in case they get bought out, and if they don’t get bought out they are likely to outperform large cap in the near future as 2/5 yr bond rates go down.

Should have bought them Wednesday/Thursday during the dip. The premiums and IV are going to be insane. Best bet at this point is buying shares or LEAPS for 2022/2023 at this point cause there could be a hard correction coming at some point. My cost basis on MARA is well below $2 from all the premium I've collected selling calls.

Yea some people still have Comcast: boomers who still haven’t cut the cord because they don’t know how to change and probably don’t even know there is competition/other options. Revenue falling for at least 4 straight quarters and 100 BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT but yes their stock is at ATH right now smh. GameStop is a retail store, Comcast is a utility. The only thing they both have in common are they are the dinosaurs of their respective industries, dying a slow death.

Everyone hates GameStop. The only people that shop there are clueless parents buying the Xbox One for little Johnny (who actually asked for the Xbox series X). Not sure how you quantify that for DD for stock picks, I’m just giving you some perspective. You seem unfamiliar with the company at the most basic level. Probably never even step foot in one, am I right?

I agree that in the short-medium run, mid-cap companies will perform comparatively stronger than large cap because they have more room to run as part of a covid recovery play. The problem is risk/reward. You have to pick the right mid caps and there is a much larger risk associated with those decisions. With large caps you could throw a dart at a board and then wait 5-10 years and you will be fine.

UPS pays decent and has a college reimbusement program. Good benefits and advancement opportunity for dedicated employees. Many shifts available to fit your life/school schedule. Won't work if you want to screw around on your phone, but highly recommend for your age and stage trying to figure life out.
28 year old male, Indian. Expat currently working in UK. Always been bad with savings. Before 'investing' I was looking to gain money sports betting. That went quite horribly wrong. Was down 2.5k GBP. Started 'investing' in July, 2020. Gain 1.2k on a 4k initial capital by August end. Then, during September and October, used leveraged trading instrument CFDs and lost all and some. This is the moment I felt like a monkey doing stupid shit - ironically this is also the time I joined WSB.

Put in some more money into the account. Shorted the US and European markets mid of October. Gained a decent return. Flipped to going long on US stocks and European Indices beginning November. Rode the wave and now I am positive 8k (after covering gambling losses and September and October losses). 

Still feel like a monkey but September and October taught a great lesson. I expect a correction sometime soon so I am exposed with 50% of my portfolio (CFD account). On the investment account I have positions ~ 8k (2.2k profit owing to ALPP).

Nowadays, I feel I am no longer reckless with expenses. I would rather put that extra money into some investment.

Thank you for the suggestion I’ll look into it man
Unless the shorts start covering, or some catalyst happens that drives the price up, we're not expecting massive growth by year end.

It may go up, but it may also go down slightly/trade sideways. Shares in this case are best, if you want calls, something dated in April is best.

Well actually I don't think our system is so great but if you want to Yolo it sure is useful.

But basically everyone is paying more taxes so that others can go to college for free even if you yourself aren't. Also there is little incentive to study something actually useful (stem) because if you don't like it just start some other ridiculous "study" and waste away another couple years. 

The interest free loans are also an incentive to blow it on parties. I get that people do it, I did it myself, but why should it be interest free (effectively a net positive after inflation). Kind of stupid if you ask me.

 I think the loan system in the US is fine, it's just that colleges are way overpriced.

Im 20 and living at home and want to go to college but that’s halted until I find a new job hopefully soon. Does anyone have any good advice to someone in my position?  Any good degrees in any fields that are actually worth something that can make me actual money instead of $10 an hour?

Games are going all-digital so GameStop will not have the used game revenue stream anymore soon enough. They are so fucking desperate for that NOT to happen they’ve been lobbying the god damn game companies to not do away with CD drives since the Xbox one. Ask any gamer, they stopped trading in their games to GS years ago anyway. Who even wants fucking $1 for their game? I’d rather throw it in the garbage.

The only Americans here saying they love GameStop is because of what their stock has potential to do. Which is fine, but if someone is saying they love the actual stores well it must be some 12 year-old’s mom who doesn’t know any better.

Big fan of that and Dunkirk
So, I have to say, this decision is a lot more complicated than you make out. I personally plan on doing this with a 3-4 bedroom condo in the not too distant future, so I have been doing a lot of research. With the myriad of other costs, fees, and taxes that start piling up, it isn't as profitable as you think early on. The ratio of money going towards the interest and other fees compared to the equity you are building up is pretty poor until you get over that 20% hurdle and stop paying the mortgage insurance. Having a few tenants helps, but you also have to factor in the time/cost investment of being a landlord and then pay taxes on that income.

I am not saying its a bad idea, I am just saying its not so cut and dry.

Why not?
My point is that the previous commenter was right, liquidity is not the main issue but solvency. The money isn’t flowing in right places. With all these aid, US is still far from pew-COVID economic health. The next drop might make March seem small in comparison. Think about it the other way, what could the Fed do to intervene in the next significant plunge that wouldn’t spook global markets. 

The whole point is to not go all-in now or time the drop. Hedge and roll your hedges if you’re  long.

Holy shit the comments.
I am a female trader and 100% agree. I am constantly trying to teach my college educated female friends how to budget, invest and do things like ask for raises. We have to concur this basic level of female financial illiteracy before you will see a larger influx of female traders. I finally started carrying visual aids in my purse to explain compound interest to them- I use them at least twice a month. I can tell my male friends that my options are printing and we will instantly be trading tips whereas my female friends are having to be taught that they will never be able to retire by putting 3% a month into their crap ass 401k.
  As far as getting an actual job in finance, my interviews were far more focused on my ability to bullshit about sports and management trying to suss out whether I was going to be a Karen that would report them to HR for every off color joke.

I agree he's taking the right steps but just looking at the already 100 stores they closed are in high trafficked area, it'snot making sense. I'm too tired to continue looking into this but later today I'll look into it more and do a DD on $BBBY, granted I have no positions on them. More than likely it'll be on r/investing because it's too much of a stable stock for WSB retards and has no drastic growth unless you have  pockets deeper than the Eastein case.

You can actually buy the underlying??
Worked for my parents. Between their investments and property value, they just became millionaires on paper. Early 50's, dad's a welder, moms a secretary, neither have any education past high school. Just persistence and time.

Personally, I paid off 15k in debt and socked away my 3 month emergency fund in 7 months after graduating college.

I also know that he has "endorsed" providers, and the real estate agent I was work with used to be one, but he said the fees he had to pay to maintain that connection weren't worth the return on potential clients for this area so he dropped it.

They also charge $100 a year for "Ramsey+" which allows to use a budgeting tool that is already free, but it links to your bank account so you don't have to actually keep track of your expenses. And you have access to FPU, even though you could buy the book for $10. If you ask me, it's for lazy people who have no discipline to take care of their own shit and read a book that a middle schooler could comprehend.

Yeah, Dave Ramsey sucks for investment advice, but it's a gateway because I have friends who think that credit card rewards are "gains". So I guess I'll give credit where credit is due because I paid off all my debt quick so that I can focus on gains instead of who is giving me the best interest rate on loans.
1977? you're fucking 40+ years old hanging out with us retards? what is wrong with you
All the information is coming from anonymous sources from China, that's what I mean. And no, I don't trust journalists unless they provide information from real sources who have the backbone to represent and stand by the information.

I saved that exact post when I was considering what to do with this extra spending money. What do you think will happen next week? Just out of curiosity.
Yeah, but they're pushing what is, at its source, potentially Chinese propaganda. Neither the platform or their sources have any sort of liability given the information offered which really just means they could have made everything up. Anyways, I think we both agree we are just arguing semantics at this point, cheers!

If you read his story, he’s basically WSB before there was WSB. He took out 90-day loans to flip houses. It worked until it didn’t when the bank’s new management called his notes. He had $2M in assets and $3M in loans I believe when they forced liquidation. He went from a millionaire to BK in a fairly short time.

He apparently swore off all debts and worked his ass off to become a millionaire again. I hate his investment advice for the same reasons others have mentioned but it’s undeniable he’s helped a lot of people.

trading has completely changed since buffett started berkshire in the mid to late 60s

markets had to be far more inefficient then than they are now, and you could exploit those inefficiencies to accumulate wealth more easily. he not only benefited from picking investments well, but also from innumerable advancements within the finance industry itself

with technology now, i don't see how the markets could be inefficient

computers can literally sort and search all stocks, across all markets based on their fundamentals and past performance, and then run all types of analyses on them, crossreference with any news about the companies or political impacts, all within milliseconds, if not nanoseconds

the prices of stocks today reflect closely what the actual value of the company is, while accounting for trends within the same industry, and geopolitical developments

given the depth of resources available to funds, they can still find ways to gain an edge. there was something about using flight tracking to monitor where executives are flying to learn about any imminent deals

however, i don't see how retail can gain an edge though. without inside connections, it's impossible to gain any insight

aside from that, market crashes can be gifts

Won't hurt I guess, but I don't even think the vaccine works well on the strain they have there. RIP UK. They said 2-6 weeks to test vaccine on new strain, even though media all lies and says oh, it should work. Ok, first it's science only, no speculation, when Orange man is in. Now it's- don't worry, we'll get around to science after policy is already done.

Scrap metal is on the rise the same reason lumber is, because of COVID and not being able to have a cluster fuck of workers scavenging the same mining area. Of course you'll see both rise simultaneously, just one will fall sharper than the other. Unfortunately iron cost more to process into steel than recycling steel itself.

>credit cards reduce fraud risk

Yeah, bud. I'm sure that's why most people use credit cards- the reduced risk of a fraudster tapping their checking account. The average carried balance of $6k is probably just Americans thanking the bank for so generously offering a product with marginally better fraud protections.
fair enough.

God damn i can't wait to go back to old country buffet.
i can tell you the exact reason why there are „undervalued“ sectors. It’s because people only buy stocks of brand names they know. Nobody uses products of a big oil or mining company for personal use. 

But they see monster energy or Starbucks and buy the stock. It’s just a zero sum money shuffling game where you have to invest in household names. It’s not about financials.

It’s just that investors have gotten dumber and dumber over the years and they buy only stocks they know.

Name me one brand that everybody and their mother used which has not at least a PE ratio of 30 or beyond. There is none. Because everybody knows the brands so they buy stock.

It’s really simple and that’s the reason why some companies are „undervalued“ is because average dumb people only buy what they know and use so they get to vote now in the markets and they don’t think much about it when they see BRAND XYZ  they buy STOCK OF BRAND XYZ.

That’s exactly why growth stocks were by far the winners over the past decade. Nobody cares about banks they don’t use. Market caps are just made up numbers. You can’t sell the whole float of a stock and expect to get the market cap as money out of it.

There’s only a few million shares traded everyday. So all the market caps are big fat lies and just a stupid metric. 

In the old days you had to find a buyer for your stocks if there’s no buyer there’s no money. 
Since trading is now electronic people think that the money comes from nothing or „company profits“ No the money comes from a buyer.

In the old days you looked them in the eyes on a trading floor with these sticky notes you would make the trade.

I’m just gunna drop my current reading list pertaining to this shit, it’s probably a bit much for now but stuff you should definitely pick it up if you’re interested. Mostly python related as that’s the end goal. I suggest tradingview’s Pine first, as it’s very easy; Pine is simple as shit. Just pull up the glossary and poke around. If you’re into the serious stuff, I have a very good Twitter guy. I picked up Pine in a week or so, and coded the DIX as an indicator for my first project. Really not too bad.

My MT calls are feeling quite nice rn. I think steel is the play for Jan-June 2021. Think it might run up 2x to 3x after earnings in feb as anyone who’s ever worked in the steel industry will say that we’re approaching 2008 levels of steel demand where MT was around $270. I mean cmon even if strike hits $40 in the next few months you’ll be making some mad tendies, and that’s a conservative estimate. Good luck all you steel gang fellas, holds those calls long and hard. Steel daddy hath blessed us.

You mean American propaganda - this is Silicon Valley pussy shit.
People have an obsession of wanting to be part of something under the guise 'it's only for short-term' but then staying in long enough where it becomes akin to long-term investing. 

I'm sure there's people on here wheeling GME thinking they aren't about to lose all their money overnight. 

That said, I'm surprised GME hasn't tried to become a game store similar to the comic shops. Where they host Magic, Yugioh, and other card tournaments while also having the Warhammer board games and other miniature figurines enthusiasts supporting the store. 

I know I read they were looking into it but with how small gamestops are, it'll be a challenge.

I did. Dont know why you shouldnt
I know holding shares for one week may feel like an eternity of boredom, but shares are the play on GME. Your short term calls will have no effect on the short squeeze, and are likely to go to zero while you wait for the squeeze to happen again.
Can someone @ this retard on StockTwits and ask how his $NKLA long is going? He goes around gay bearing on everything, and then went long on $NKLA two weeks ago at $18, because “it had to go up.” He obviously blocked me because I couldn’t help but laugh at anyone would buy $NKLA at any price.

Ackman, his Hedgefund, and a ridiculous number of investing heavyweights are holding shares of PSTH.  There is $5 billion on the sidelines right now of some of the most respected institutional investors to play the game.  Do you really think that Ackman, who 1 month ago stated they want a LOI in Q1 2021 and are on track for that schedule, is content letting all that money sit on the sideline for the next 11 months? The answer is no.  Furthermore, in 6 months to a year the threat of Covid will be much reduced.  Deals will be harder for him to come by.  This thing will move by the end of Q1.
After? You missed out.

Sort of how I've been feeling about it, they're priced like lottery tickets but boy does it look like a miracle could happen at any minute. I've seen everything from a short squeeze on Wednesday to a short squeeze in February. I've got no fucking clue.

Still like MT but wondering how long the shortage will last. Already have 6/18 $25 calls but thinking about getting more aggressive with April $30 calls in case the run is more short-lived than expected. Any suggestions or more info on the peak of MT riding the shortage?
Dont have a story. Staring at this sub over a year now. cant make head or tails of it. Even Sumerian cunieform is easier. I wish there was a simple way to learn it.  
Somehow Youtube recommended this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5RCmu-HuTg).

BUT
I don’t think comparing the inflation to other pre-crash scenarios makes sense. It’s really just tech stocks ballooning and frankly given how materially everything has shifted aside from a minor correction I can’t see it being a full blown crash. You have so many sectors still recovering and undervalued (banking, travel, retail). People that keep saying there will be a crash are misunderstanding  the underlying circumstances that caused each of the previous crashes. A correction sure but if you’re mostly diversified you should be fine.

Agreed. A small, low-risk (think: steady market, no repairs, very nearby) rental property is great. With the returns from that you can lower your own expenses, add income, or maybe buy 2 Teslas. ;)

Why are there barely any women traders? You can’t tell me it’s sexism because anyone has access to trades, and anyone can make the winning trades. It’s not like there’s some misogynistic person processing your trades for you and is only allowing men to do it

I remember in college, my major was like 90% men. The girls in the class always made it seem like they’re so rad and heroic for being women in a male dominated major, and that it was misogyny holding women out

It never made sense to me because any student can choose any major they want. There isn’t anyone stopping women from doing it. And there’s no bouncer standing outside the classrooms only allowing men inside. The graders don’t check your ballsack when they score your tests

Personal opinion bullish. Just because they are raking in profits on Beyond+ members that can't exercise their 20% off discount on items already discounted beyond 20%. This shows the company is still able to make some sort of profit off an item, and also taking in profit from Beyond+ members like myself. Case in point bought a Google Nest from them that they "discounted" 21% and I tried applying my 20% off discount on top of it and it told my retarded ass to fuck off.

Also because they are a perfect one stop shop for cheap fixer upper douchebags that buy crap products that look visually appealing.

Edit: Just tried it, they no longer allow you to use your 20% off entire order for anything already "discounted" which is nearly 70% of their items now. I see a CAL coming their way which might make it bearish... idk I'm tripping on shrooms but I say ya dude they're the next sears, you'll see a good rise then they'll crash like I'm about to.

Had a ally invest act my pops and I set up a few years back just doing divi investment on AMZA. Learned about options and the virus new in late dec early jan. Got approved for otions in feb right as I bought my first house. Dropped 3.5k into the account to play with and went to nearly 21k on spy puts in march. 17k was my moving average for a few weeks and I got greedy because 25k would have cleared all debt except my homeloan. Diamond handed those puts into nothing but hedged a bit with some shares at march lows. Made bad weekly trades from may through sep and got shaken out of some shares by congress news(looking at you nio where I sold at 4.98). 

tried to run a advance strategy on Nokia of all stocks since I got a block of 100 back at 2.83. Had a stack of 5/7/10 calls that I wanted to sell the 7 and 10s to exercise the 5s but it never hit my target so those a burning a hole in my account.

Learned a literal fuck ton during all of this and revisited my "american mining stategy" 2 weeks ago and got into american battery metals corp and poly met mine. Wish I had spotted the drone news and got AL  "pp" too because that run is insane. Currently sitting around 2.7k but green and since may I have pulled about 2k out of the account to fund bills and debt.

Not good per say and not terrible either. Learned more then I ever imagined and was humbled many times and also saw the account go to nearly 0 on more then a few occasions. Blew up my robinhood account and my td account that I made in april as well so i'm just riding with my ALLY.

When did you snag these? I have 100 Jan 15 22' leaps that cost me $1.25 a pop. Seems like a brutal price point expiring in April.  Regardless though, I'm rooting for you AND steel!
With a 13% drop iv might have them a little more expensive than normal, either way I agree and will be doing something similar!
Thanks for the update! I am just wondering though, Doesn't low sales volume and high steel prices give the same revenue as normal sales volume and normal prices? Can we really be sure MT will have a strong ER in February just because prices went up (but not the sales volume)? Selling 10 items for $1 gives the same revenue as selling 1 item for $10, so what am I missing?

You can defer it by starting a business before EOY. Startup costs like phones and PCs can be deducted from your earnings. Also look into rolling gains into Solo 401k.

I was convinced to hit shares over calls right now, and not being super experienced I decided to hold on on going any further into options, I made a small time bet on QQQJ where worst case I can just not exercise it and lose the 100 it cost me, I’ll go balls deep in that stuff when if/when I make some cash through what I got or learn a little more.

Meanwhile here in the US, we have interest accumulating on our student loans at high interest rates, and they can never be forgiven, even when unexpectedly getting cancer makes you go bankrupt. Awesome country we got here. I know you’re jealous.
Immediately stop buying options. Take your time and buy stock, slowly add in options after 2-3 months off. 1 at a time. That’s what I did and I went from -20,000 from my starting point to 100% for the year. I’m not mad, even when I see people with 10x baggers and 300-1,000% profit gains. 6% a year for S&P ain’t bad so I’m fine with 100%! I’d recommend a few EV but probably ARKG or any ARK funds. Stick with a 9-5 and just build up your account. Don’t sell at highs, just buy more dips

Idk how to trade on my laptop on robinhood and I have $200 in gme calls expiring this coming week. She won't even let me use the phone to sell my calls. This is ridiculous
I am in the procurement sector. As China is a major supplier to the world, right now the prices of shipments by sea containers have increased 3x. The reason being is that the containers are full exiting China, but empty when they return as China imports are much less than its exports currently, at least for th region I am living in.

Btd
There are multiple things GME could try and get into. At this point everything is speculation. It depends on what the board wants,whether cohen can take over and many-many factors. What I'll write below is not well researched or anything, obviously, it's just to show you that there are ways this relic of a company can turn itself around.

  here are some ideas i've seen in DDs, and my thoughts on them:

1, selling used electronics. (Have fun downloading that shit)  For example: a new gpu costs a fuckton of money. Most people cant afford the best graphics cards at any given point. Especially not kids/young adults, who are the main target audience anyway.

Buying it used tho is risky, you cant just go on ebay and order one, for obvious reasons. You need someone you can trust, if you wanna buy electronic parts that are delicate and easily amortized in nature. 

Bam, that's where gamestop, a large brand with soon to be great costumer service comes into the picture. Everytime someone talks about chewy, they talk about great costumer experience. If cohen did it there, he could do it here

So.. You walk into gamestop and buy a 1 generation old, used gpu, cause that's what you can afford. You also sell your old one in place, hell you have their expert install it for you, cause you're retarded and dont know how to.

2, Esports

Now, i was really-really sceptic on this one. Main reason: esports that are worth organizing/being involved in are already done by professionals. Look at league/cs/sc2/dota2 and tell me that a small store of gamestop can be involved in that. Lmao. 

BUT! Gamestop could be involved in lower tier teams. Teams that arent pro, maybe not even semi-pro, but are on their way there. In a subscription model, they could use gamestop's stuff (and space) to train at and blabla. Basically a not absolutely shit version of a netcafè

And of course they could organise amateur events, events that are now organized in a really unprofessional setting. = Gamestop comes in and elevates amateur,but established events to the next level.

3, Esports, but with obscure titles

A continuation of amateur events:

There are games out there, popular enough to justify a tournament, but way-way below esport-popular. E.g. HOTS lmao, aoe2, aoe3, older empire earth games, civ games, HOMM games, and so on. 

Not going to bring massive revenue, if any, but it's free marketing. If you go to gamestop to play a quick tournament of whatever, then you're more likely to come back and buy something that they can profit on. E.g. a fucking used GPU

This BABA Probe is a powergrab for the CCP.

Ever get some really good advice and then look at the dudes post history and he has 50 posts in r/randomactsofblowjobs 😂
this doesn't work for everybody. Some people are anti-socials or worst sociopaths, and they are just better off avoiding relationships, and especially starting a family. I am anti-social, I always have been, my relationships always end up failing, and I get into them in the first place because I'm pulled into them and go with the flow, I have never longed for them. I find pleasure through things, not people. When I get involved with people, I end up creating pain and disruption. I don't want to create a family, because it would propagate these traits, and they are not beneficial for society (in a way natural selection is already cleverly making it difficult for me to start a family for this very reason). So while its valid for most people, its not a universal truth that relationships is where its at. 
Sorry for the long message btw

Nice post
Explains PLTR and some others like PSTH and GME but this is obviously only true for some meme stocks. Doesn't explain others like PRPL, HTZ, MT, VALE, RKT, and others. Also there are tons of companies with ambiguous (shitty?) mission statements that never get popular here even with the never-ending supply of morons who think that writing a DD post with rockets will help them unload their bags.
Kidney comes out Tuesday, wish I could sell it faster, but regardless it’s another $3500 on PLTR.

The CCP has its fingers in *everything*.  It's more of a non-free free market capitalistic economy with Communist underpinnings behind the scenes.  Essentially a "[free market for unfree people](https://www.politico.eu/article/chinas-promise-a-free-market-for-unfree-people/)."

Most if not all ships are scrapped once the future estimated operating cost outway the scrap price. Since steel prices are rising it's easier for vessel owners to scrap their ships earlier and makes a quick buck to reinvest into a new fleat. Eventually this will plateau because a lot of industries are turning in their scrap during the all time high price, taking away from the need of the mining industries ore. Yes I agree $MT is on the rise but it will correct itself because refined scrap is cheaper to recycle than ore. Posting a video about how scrap of steel is on the rise is contradicting to your point retard. Scraping takes business away from raw material miners...

This is the way
Remember this about chart patterns, the ones listed by the above commenter are widely recognized and people do act on them.

The stock Market is not "real" in the strict sense of that word. It operates as a simulacrium of real day to day market forces, but the market itself is based entirely off what people and instutions are doing. In other words, the stock market is a game. 

As such it's subject to game theory. Chart patterns are representative of a certain trading strategy. Lots of people believe in stock patterns and will buy or sell based off them.

A bunch of people buying based on the chart will cause the stock to go up. A bunch of people selling will make it go down. 

See what I'm getting at? The charts are more psychological than anything. They operate as a self fulfilling prophecy. Traders acting on patterns make those patterns occur. 

In other words, patterns are nonsense in my opinion, but since people believe in them, they are actually not nonsense at all.

Its completely normal, and required,  for a foreign company listed on a US exchange.

Also, BABA is on a "big" exchange, not just some OTC shit so they have to basically submit all the same reports and follow all the same requirements an actual US company would.

I think Andrew stumbled upon a new retarded strategy with VLDR/LAZR. Long one, short the other, make money both ways. 

Bet he applies this strat to RIOT/MARA. Choose wisely.
The only way CLX gonna moon is if the pandemic surges, or a country forces people into buying it. If only there was an industry where the government of a large economy was creating policy to encourage purchases in that industry. That would be electrifying!
I don't put a lot of credence into that. Shorts be doing shorty shit. Just stick to the thesis and play through at least the Spring/Summer 2021.

Some people swear by chart patterns. Personally I think you may as well consult stars, or the entrails of bulls for your next financial moves. 

Thats not to say they are worthless, just that charts don't tell you much of the full story. They do reliably show resistance points and the like but if you're doing technical analysis, you're better off playing for the underlying math of the stock, or jumping on the speculation rocket-ship. That second is what WSB is good for.

As for GME, most investors are buying into it because there are more shorts on it than stock in the float. That could trigger a short squeeze if it's price stays above a certain threshold.

Depends on the stock. Look at ticker price, volatility, recent company news, potential upcoming news, and history. Then decide whether or not you can live with the shares being called away and if so at what price. Then decide how much in premiums is worth it for you. I have >100 shares in several tickers where the premiums are just not worth the risk for me to sell options, but others where I make enough that it's a great source of passive income. It all depends. Just make sure you're also making some good lotto side bets. Premium from selling  calls is fun and stay income but I've made way more money from buying.

Well buy the fuckin dip
Got burned bad by this. I was trading the 300 strike like a champ till Ma fucked up. But calls/sell puts.

Now I'm sitting on January 15th 300 puts (sold) and 280 puts that I got to double down.

I am retarded, so was thinking more calls (long) and selling puts Monday.
.... I feel attacked.
this isn’t our world folks, it belongs to a superior entity or entities that appear to or actually align with two opposing qualities that at times seem to complement each other, good and evil, god and the devil, order and chaos, etc

as humans we can stick our heads in the sand thereby giving in completely to both entities/both sides of the one entity to battle it out through us, or we can align with one side and oppose the other in the hopes that it will free us, what we cannot do however, is assume that we alone can be in charge of anything because that would be mass delusion 

... then again our confusion regarding them could be their actual mo..  we may find out if/when we escape time and space (physicality), so maybe after death... ugh, who the fuck knows anything really
Didn’t know Cramer was a bear
Naww....the firefighters stopped by and left like an hour later.  Not gonna cause a real dip.

Got a BJ from a guy

I’m 37HLM, married in a 15 year relationship with a 36LLF. Typical sexless marriage, occasional vanilla starfish duty sex for years,  which I now always refuse. No oral, giving or receiving, for about a decade. She just doesn’t want it or me and I accept that.

Anyway, last night I matched with a guy who was looking to blow a straight married man without any reciprocation. He did everything I’ve ever wanted, without me saying a word, for over an hour straight. Two orgasms. He complimented my cock in ways my wife never has nor will. It was the most desirable I’ve felt in a long time.

I know this might sound stupid and a bit condescending but try it out, worked for one of my friends who was in a similar situation. Literally just do the opposite of everything you’ve been doing.

Obviously whatever you’ve been doing hasn’t been working, so do the complete opposite and don’t listen to yourself.

1. Learn from your mistakes and learn from your successes.
2. Ask yourself if you're making a gamble when you want to buy. If it feels like 50/50, it's a gamble. If it feels like 70/30, much safer.
3. Learn to identify trends, use things such as lines of resistance and support, spot patterns. I always try to find volatile stocks that are predictable and then buy when it's undervalued.

$40 is low-balling it. This is the start of a new console cycle, which for the previous two console cycles meant a share price of around $120 and $90 with today's outstanding shares. That was without the massive shorting that we have today.

Considering the short squeeze potential, this can reach much higher than $100/share. How much depends on how quickly enough people sell and cover all the short positions. In this case you really want to wait with selling. $40 is doing the shorts a favour. 

I personally won't be selling anything for less than $100. Hopefully more.

Very toxic and difficult to create a lasting battery that doesn't emit a slow burn off of the metal.

Reading this subreddit never fails to please! Holy shit you guys have me cracking up.
My question was more general and I only used TSLA as example to explain what I meant. For someone who has a higher education, I am clueless about basic research. Maybe because I am new to this and I don't yet know what a trustworthy source of data is.

That being said, thank you for the executive summary. If it is not too much to ask. Do you think market share increase until 2030 (or whenever perrol gars are wiped out) is already priced into the stock and we can expect this mkt cap to stay until closer to such time? Or is there possibility od increase in stock price?

Your post history is full of you asking people what options to buy. This is your problem. You ask retards for advice instead of actually doing your own research. There are actually some options out there that, as they say, literally can't go tits up (unless the whole economy crashes, then we're fucked lmao.) Do some reading on your own, outside of the daily thread. 

You know the whole casino meme? Stocks don't have to be roulette, they can also be poker. You can still bet and yet try to be skilled at it, not a moron. And by you I mean people in general. YOU in particular should take a break, because you're on tilt.

So buy dnkg calls?
And the retards of wsb will be buying calls cuz bears hella gay.
It doesn't. However, it does give me an insight that your average person isn't gonna have. Knowing how long it's going to take to get steel can be a make or break thing for machinists, so it pays to see where something may cause a shortage(goes for all our materials, aluminum, plastics, steel, copper, etc) so that it can be factored in when quoting a job. Customer doesn't want their parts 2 weeks late cause you didn't know you couldn't get material. Now, whether all this means the stock price of steel manufacturers is gonna go up, no clue. I don't know the correlation between the two well enough. I was just saying that the idea that there's stockpiles of pre covid lockdown steel sitting around that didn't get used doesn't add up with the difficulty procuring steel that I'm seeing in industry.
Lmao. Never bet on China. Is it too late to buy puts?

They think people would just say the winners were invented and no one actually won.  But really it just promotes a lot of bad opportunity for scammers and ..unfriendlies.. to come bother you.  

In other states you can at least create a blind trust and have your lawyer claim it, then have them seed the trust with the funds.  So there is a level of anonymity.  But in others (like mine) they essentially want you to do a tapdance in front of the cameras with the giant check.
I can't tell what is a meme or sarcasm in these posts anymore.

The honest answer to your question is that I have 160 pounds of salt bagged for this very thing. Everh department store sells 40 pound bags for next to nothing for snow/ice.
I can’t focus on a movie in my living room, it’s gotta be in the theater
Me. And other wsb peeps who just want everyone to make money and not rope.
Thanks for calling me a genius but tbh it was another lucky accident. I actually wanted to get my annual bonus into my savings in Jan but forgot to change my 401k settings and surprised myself when the default was to put all of my bonus into the 401k. Was pretty pissed off originally actually, wanted to spoil myself with some toys vs be responsible and save for retirement

Also got an email reminder that my 401k had a “self-directed brokerage” option and started yolo-ing after I learned that since I didn’t have any money in my savings/checking at all, the only account with any money was my 401k

Also kind of agree with what /u/lavanderXXX and /u/zdonkeyspeaks said. The info here is good but the tone is out of touch with the type of people on WSB. We are 100% degenerates yolo-ing lotto tickets as an escape from wage slavery due to late stage capitalism and our desperation shows. The thing I like most about this place is we’re self-aware about it and proud of our degeneracy, I think that’s the main diff between here and pretty much any other investing forum

Also work on your writing. Way too much fluff vs content and pacing was really boring. No wonder your other post on taxes didn’t get much upvotes
What’s that about?
Outside. It's called a PWS, pedestrian warning system. You can get an obnoxiously posh British voice to admonish people not to stare, and change your horn to a fart sound. Legendary.
I appreciate you. I do think 87% in 13 % out is honorably aggressive.
Even better, buy leaps and sell monthlies
Wait ate you talking about Ramsey or Robbins? The way the flow of comments read made it sound like this was about Robbins.  If this is about Ramsey then I get it, makes sense

I have the exact same calls at the exact same price! To the moon, boys! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I’m not a financial consultant by any means but if you only have 1k to play and it took you months to save YOLOing calls is probably not a good decision. Especially if you’re as new as you say and have no idea what’s going on... Like the gentleman/woman before me said you should try shares just to see how the market works first. The profits are slower but the losses are too. You have to plan for the worse if you want to make money. Just an FYI when you have contracts with a close expiry even as far as a month out, you lose it faster than you gain it. It can take 10 minutes to go up $100 then within a minute you’re back in the red hundreds of dollars and it gets worse as you get closer to expiration. 

Before I go I want to leave you with some boomer advice; don’t put in what you can’t afford to lose and putting more money in your account doesn’t equate to making more money (unless you’re consistently profiting). Good luck and Godspeed my friend. I pray the gain gods favor you.

Yeth. Because Teslas are scary ninja cars that are way too damn quiet.
Good Molly
That’s literally his whole pitch though. He was rich but stupid and blew all his money, then had to learn how to climb out of debt. Now he’s helping other people (especially those with little to no financial knowledge) escape debt and begin to build wealth.
You have to look at market cap as share price is essentially arbitrary. There's used to be 100M shares outstanding. There's are only 69.75M today. So a 40$ share price in 2015 is equal to a 57.40$ share price now.

Edited. Had share price numbers flipped*

Not sure what they said but I’m guessing it was about the house. I’m also in the Midwest, and my area is not expensive. I wanna get outta here and I need PLTR 🚀 to help with that. 😂
Basically like options, but if you exercise a warrant you don't buy the shares off of another person, but the company issues new shares and sells them to you for the strike price.


Issuing warrants is another way to raise cash for companies.



At least that's how I understand it.

I do believe that 210 is the ABSOLUTE lowest it could go, however i wouldn’t do a weekly on BABA. Extend it for at least two weeks if you have the money for the premium. I do believe BABA is due for a bounce back especially if Jack Ma kisses up to China.
Pretty sure if I knew it would snow this much I’d hoard salt more than people hoard toilet paper when a hurricane hits.

Any press is good press
How about you try to discredit my argument, instead of focusing on the personal intentions behind my posts. Yes I have 100% of my portfolio in psth + margin, I bought back in September, and I did not buy because I thought it would be stripe.

I now believe it will be stripe based on the combination of coincidences I have previously described. People here are retarded because a) they don’t understand the tontine structure b) have no patience for this investment (6 months) and c) they have completely written off stripe when it is in fact probably stripe.

You can either discredit the merits of my argument, or we can just wait and see.

Most of them should have shares or long dated calls. FDs maybe should get out. I got some 1/15 calls I was going to sell next week. But after the 1/13 catalyst Ima hold. I might get burned but I payed pennies for them. Willing to risk it for the potential upside. 

We need people to hold their shares though.

To clarify: it was a 401k loan which I maxed at the $50k limit and I “pay myself back” every month which is an interesting concept

My goal is to hit $10M and then basically just withdraw a few thousand every year and take the income tax and penalty hit while young. Sure 10% to Uncle Sam sucks but that just means I need to make an extra 10% to offset it, I wanna live whole young yo

Here is the man himself explaining some of his methods. Dude was managing an 8-digit portfolio before GME exploded. I think GME has only contributed to increasing his net worth by like maybe 20%. His assessment of risk/reward, finding value, and portfolio diversification is fucking next level shit.   


Stacks on stacks on stacks of info, coded scripts, processing through his brain that works too fast for him to talk, which I think is why sometimes he stutters cuz he talks freaking fast, but his brain works much faster.

Starlink IPO will take a bit of time. It is currently beta testing a 99$/month broadband connection. Its pretty fucking rad the dish is self aligning!

In the state I live in, the winner(s) has to allow the state lotto commission advertise their name, city, and a photo of them.

The last person that won it big on one of those had to leave town because of all the hands out and jealousy.   I heard from a friend (who is a friend of the winners) that even in the uppity community they moved to, the neighbors don't interact much since they got their money through a lotto versus earned.   And they still get creepers giving death threats on their children demanding money (years later).

Estimates are for sea levels to rise by 45 cm (18 inches) by 2035. This will impact coastlines and lead to billions of displaced people around the world. In the US approximately 40% of the population is along the coasts and in proximity/susceptible to flooding - this will be the single largest major disruptive force over the next 20 years. 

That said, where should we be looking at investing in the next few years? Companies that build sea walls? Of course green tech (ICLN and PDA.C, SOA.C) are going to continue to blow up. Water commodities and  Water companies due to increased droughts?

Dave Ramsey was required listening at my highschool (2006). He’s pretty elementary, but that is so important for people who have no financial literacy. Americans aren’t typically taught personal finance at school, and with many families living paycheck to paycheck they likely won’t learn it at home either.

I’d argue that the “obvious” advice isn’t obvious at all to some peopke. If Dave can package the concepts into a way that can speak to the financially illiterate, then I’d say he earned his paycheck. That’s not to say that him peddling the mutual fund advice is okay or even ethical, but the bread and butter of his course is almost undeniably effective at reducing people’s debt and setting then up for success in the future.

Don't forget that you can also use your Roth IRA to move around money in creative ways.

For example, fund your Roth IRA first, and build it up so you have enough in pure gains for unlimited day trades and a good buffer (Only took me a year with $12,000 in contributions because you have until April to contribute last years amount). Then you can be free to take your initial contribution out to use in a regular brokerage account. You can also just leave the entire amount in to build up money for retirement faster but personally  I prefer to just have enough to build up for a comfortable retirement while focusing on building wealth I can use while still young.

Another thing you can do is to quit your job and roll over your pension or 401k etc into a Roth IRA account. It's better to do this earlier in the tax year because you get taxed on it if rolling over to a Roth IRA. By quitting your job early in the year, you can reduce your taxes if you don't find or decide to take another job right away.

Personally, I don't mind getting taxed initially because it's a pension in my case and after doing the math, I have a much better chance of ending up with more money by just investing it myself in a Roth IRA than the total of what I would get with a pension when I retire. If you have an employer matched 401K though, you might wanna think twice because you basically have 100% returns on your contributions.

It also helps if you're vested in your contributions. 

Also keep in mind that you can always still withdraw from a Roth IRA. It just has a 10% penalty + you have to pay the usual taxes. Just avoid doing this unless you have more money than you need in there because you can't put money back in if you're over your yearly limit.

Things that a Roth IRA can also be used for without the 10% penalty is tuition for higher education for yourself or family, 10,000 towards a house deposit or house renovations every two years, medical bills, and apparently you can use it if you're unemployed. Also for 2020, you can withdraw regardless if your income been affected by covid. I'm assuming this will also get extended to 2021 but we don't know yet.

You dont have to work so hard everyday because you don't have to save up to retire because you won't age. Every day would be fun. 
Current retirement things is that you are 50, your body is starting to fall apart and you finally have time to do what you want, which kinda sucks.
And if you still long for retirement and death, just work the same way you are now, save up, have retirement fun while still in a young body and go out yourself peacefully. Still beats retiring in an old body.

2018 was an artificial high. Everyone trying to beat the Trump tariffs and send steel to the US as fast as possible. Prices jumped early in the year and kept going. They then plunged in 2019 because there was so much import steel on the ground and in the pipeline - all of it was worth less when it arrived than when it left what ever country on the boat.  

The street knew 2018 was not a buy.

I was just convinced over the past half hour by a user here that I am in fact retarded for not buying into GME yet. 

20 shares coming my way on Thursday, and I think I have all the meme stocks now.
The idea of a squeeze is that they’re forced to buy because their pain threshold has been exceeded, don’t have the funds to continue, etc. and it rally’s the price.

I simply set my limit sell to close my position for a very nice profit in the freak accident case but if you’re asking whether $40 GME would crash to zero, no. That depends on your entry price and you don’t lose all of your money until you sell.
can’t find an article at the moment, but [this](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJG28w4N/) is where I heard. Supposedly using a flight tracker this journalist (looked him up, he’s associated with Business Insider) noticed the last few nights there’s been an unusual amount of USAF marked planes in the middle east. Can’t 100% fact check it at the moment, but like I said it’s just what I heard.

Many thanks Uber Rod.  Glad to hear you think highly of RK.  I've caught a couple of his streams, and his GME energy is infectious.  I'll see if I can dig up a high-res of the astronaut meme, that's a great idea.
MT and VALE gang goin to be eating this coming February 🐸🚀
I’m gonna need to invite someone over to my house so they can smell my room and tell me how bad it is. I think I’ve become desensitized to the smell
Started in August 2020 with buying a single SNE $82.5 call expiring Jan 15. Immediately after got burned with AAPL and WMT spreads in September and switched my attention to SPACS. At that moment it seemed a good middle ground between risky options and boring stocks. Eventually I decided to move my option profits to stocks... So I gamble a 1-2kk every month and if I win, I invest.
Stocks, sportsbooks, roulette... Maybe a problem oh well
If you’ve actually read my comments you would know I am doing exactly that, I’ve watched some YouTube videos on some things, not even close to being done, I’m also in school and I work 7 days a week (where I currently am now). I can’t learn it all at once, and I’m sorry YOLOing 200 dollars has bothered you on such a level lol. It’s a lot more fun to learn when you actually have something to look at to get invested (pun) into it to begin with.

I put half of ours in...they come around. u/uberkikz11, thanks as always been following your DD on here, ST and SA closely. Being super cynical I don’t want to get too hyped because Sherman could still fuck it up/conspiracies as you mentioned. I also saw someone ask on one of CPTHubbard’a DD’s about some kind of backdoor exit for shorts and it went unanswered, is there anything like that or could retail investors actually finally get what we deserve here?

Except there are multiple things he's wrong about and he absolutely refuses to acknowledge it.  Such as investing in mutual funds over index funds.  Whenever he's challenged on this he claims his mutual funds out preform index funds, but he won't tell you which ones.  Then he goes on to defend his stance by saying he knows better than everyone else because he's rich.  He treats his advice as if it's religious dogma.

The guy is trying to sell poor people obvious advice in overpriced courses, and then funnel them into his advertising network of financial service providers.  His whole schtick is pretending to be an authority to people that are too dumb to know better.  He's nothing but a charlatan.

If you need somebody to talk to and discuss the actual profitability of strategies / how to be consistent and risk management while retaining aggressive positions, let me know or DM me.

The default result of options trading when you only buy is you slowly decay. Selling goes the other way, and it doesn’t require infinite risk. There’s algorithmic trading, trend following, TA/mean reversion, mathematical edges, etc.

I know how you’re feeling and it can get worse. You’ll feel more desperate to make back your losses so you’ll put them in even more aggressive plays until you’re nearly zeroed. Don’t do that. Stop and analyze your next play.

No such thing as bad publicity, right? Right?!? Please God someone tell me it's gonna be ok!
We heard the same shit since $4 where sitting at $20 right now.  Last console cycle this stock was sitting at $50. Alot of big changes underway. Couldn't give a shit if this stock takes a giant shit next week. I remained unfazed. Big thangs are underway.
🤔ok if I understand you correctly, on Monday I go and buy 900 shares of $psth, then hold till they acquired something then merged.  After merger they will automatically add 200 warrants to my account which then I can convert those to shares?
Huge shortage. So many coins being bought by Grayscale and large corporations. Every day there are new billion dollar companies announcing they put in X amount of their treasury reserve into biddy.
Just curious, have any of you ever met a mentally stable trans person?
Why not learn the game while playing it? Obviously there’s something to this place, I’m not gambling away my life savings, I’m only 200 deep right now, which is nothing, if I posted my account they’d ban me, I don’t see the harm in throwing my hand in the pot and test the waters while I slowly learn more about it.

They could indeed be also selling ITM puts. I've written elsewhere abt Melvin buying puts (and losing money).

Agree. With the recent bidding on the C-band 5G spectrum it's going to be a decent up front hit, especially with no infrastructure in place to actually utilize it at the moment. $T won't even begin to capitalize off the new 5G spectrum until realistically 2022. There's more loss/spending on the horizon for AT&T than profits for this field. This is a case to LEAP that shit instead of buying stonks, unless you're a boomer.

I took out loans on my credit cards of $53.5k total (part of it was to meet a day trade margin call).  I was down $17.5k. On Nov 2nd.  Now I am up $52k.  And have paid back all of it but $20k.  It is no different than trading on Margin as some one said in one of the comments.  I have also almost doubled my retirement accounts since June 1st ($176k to $330k, was about $360k on Wed).

**It's my birthday today I'm 26 years old** 

Here are some facts about me:

- Virgin 

- Live with parents + sleep next to them sometimes as I get scared in the dark

- Hold parents hands when crossing busy road

- Not allowed to stay out after dark

- Unemployed. Graduated with useless degree over 2+ years ago

- Can't drive.

- Don't drink.

- $100 pocket money per week, needless to say I buy TSLA calls every time

- Still think daily about a crush I had on a girl 9 years ago never spoke to her. Stalk her on FB every few days.

- Never been on holiday abroad

- No friends only childhood friends who have moved on with life

- Shower once a week only (at least I use a bidet though)

- take a selfie about once or twice a year

- Haven't shaved down below in like 3 years

- Know the names and faces of maybe 500 pornstars

- 5'4 and weigh about probably 90lbs

- Haven't bought any new clothes in like 3 years

How am I doing?
Told you guys to buy more MARA last week
I looked at VALE stock real quick and steel price on charts showed 900 in 2018. The stock barely spiked.

What makes you so confident that it might rise again considering it barely moved in 2018?
Beetcoin biggest bubble of 2020
Shut up, virgin.
So good ... What’s this song called
Hence the reason I was reluctant to post on this sub. I was just trying to give y’all a good laugh.
I thought so too. The only thing I can think is they had a log of what I was supposed to get and credited me the current price of the stock. But either way, it was nice to have the buying power instead of a potential trash company
Can you jerk yourself off at the same time as long as the tips don't touch?
YOLO! There's a little PLTR here under Mama Cathie's guiding hand.
Think this starts going back up Monday. China likes BABA being a international badass. Thinking about buying 1 long term contract that’s barely OTM.
I see you are a man of culture with CCL puts.
My 401k was 100% in SPY and I moved it all to Nasdaq. Yes, I love to live bold.
I used RIOT and SI as proxy plays, both stock I got at the bottom in March. Holyshit these ripped. I’ve been selling CC’s on the Riot shares 1 month to expiry about 50% OTM and I’m at a negative cost basis.
Yeah I was hammered last night didn’t get on wsb

Yeah I can blend in here, but I don't think like a true WSB-sub degenerate. I'm an investor that likes to try his hand at speculating, not the other way around.

You've never heard of AAA or "anti aircraft artillery" it seems. I'm no expert but I'm guessing this is a ks-12 anti air gun. Soviets made em in the 40 through to the 60s. They'd fire I timed shell that would explode at a certain distance/altitude and shred it's target with shrapnel

You're right that this scene shows an artillery piece but using one as anti air isn't abnormal at all. Artillery is just a large bore land gun and can be used for many different purposes.

In WW2 the Germans had huge success with the 8.8cm flak gun which they used for both anti air and anti tank purposes. You'd just be using different projectiles for the different targets, the gun was the same though.

I started with my life savings of 70k at the beginning of this year. At 1.5 mil today. I understand. Just wanted to give you shit for blacking out your numbers.

But having a plan and sticking to it, is important.

Ive been playing this all wrong virtually since the pandemic, but TLT looks like it is forming a short term bottom. Fed purchases of treasuries are still happening and i have a feeling that the next couple of weeks tlt could make an unanticipated quick move higher..I’m playing it with really short term 159 calls....i feel like after the stimulus news, 162 is possible by Thursday if the global stock market takes a pause and I absolutely expect it will.
Buy calls. They only go up; when they go down buy more. If they keep going down, buy more. 🚀🌕
That’s literally what that is.

Those 200 shares will likely to be worth 75-80k in 5 years.
The SPX historical volatility in the last 30 days was actually 14  and normal historical range of VIX (outside of corrections or crashes) is 12-13. It should get there this spring, possibly soon after Georgia elections. It's actually VERY rare for VIX to stay above 20 for longer than a couple months.

You buy psth before the merger and hold through the merger (aka just wait and say yes you want to remain a shareholder)

The warrants already trade on the stock exchange. You presumably would just have them added to your account

30 days after the merger the warrants become exercisable, aka you can exercise them to buy stock at $23 (which you could then immediately sell at the actual share price, which could be 50, 70, 90, 150?)

That’s fair, but just consider that this pandemic will last considerably longer than most people realize. Biden’s first 100 days are “100 days of masking”. There is also a new strain of COVID ravaging Europe. Damage control will take at least another half year if not more. Also, there will be many germaphobes created from this pandemic. At some point you have to adjust price for a company that is performing well.

It was one of the two, I just buy what this sub tells me to buy and figure it out later. I’ve been convinced in the passed 5 minutes to dump a bunch of money into GME, so I’m buying 20 shares Thursday of that too. I just need the money to lockdown my wife before her boyfriend does.

i have a measly 200 shares n am selling two 30 strikes against them for jan15.. something tells me that the week of jan1 is gonna have some excitement n that maybe i shouldn’t be selling these calls if i wanna keep my shares . thoughts deltalake?
When I touch myself I usually never actually think about sex I think about money and vacations. Makes sense since I’m obsessed with money . If I was a man making money would make my dick so hard

As in they’ll auto sell if they reach that price? Interesting stuff. I’m willing to hold, I just find it hard to really be convinced these guys will reach that price from 2015 again, seems like an uphill battle for them for years now.

I set limit sell to $60 and $120 for half and half of my position just for the laughs.

I think $40 is a reasonable price target for a slow squeeze.

Every little bit counts guys. If you do the DD, this is a value play even at $20. And that's just based on console cycle alone. (The PS5 has more disc consoles than digital only.) Throw in a potential RC takeover and the possible short squeeze and it just gets tastier. Like what Warren Buffet said, buy the fucking dip.

Thank you. The absolute same to you & your family. I'm so thankful for what I've gained thus far, and am so happy for him and his. I only communicated with him via the stream and Twitter DMs ... and from the many, many hours of all that I can say he's a great human being that loves life and brings an amazing energy to things he's passionate about. So glad that he was u/DeepFuckingValue this whole time. Someone needs to really give that astronaut earth meme the DFV/RK treatment and have him frame it in his office. Maybe a nicer house than the one they've been renting.
Hmmm... interesting

I researched this and here's what I found: https://www.livestrong.com/article/552886-making-spinach-more-digestible/

>  Repetition

> According to the Hygiene Library Catalogue, making spinach a regular part of your diet will improve your body's ability to process and digest the foliage. If you are an individual who initially has trouble digesting raw spinach, try integrating it into meals several times a week. As your body adjusts to the unique texture and chemical makeup you will find a reduction in symptoms with respect to digesting and passing spinach. In addition, keeping spinach a regular part of your diet will help your digestive track get the full benefit of the glycoglycerolipids found in spinach.

Been eating spinach for years. I think I'm OK absorbing the nutrients without oil.

What a fucking retard lol
We have been doing GWAS for 20 years with microarrays now full sequencing. Most Mendelian disorders(easiest to figure out) have been identified. We haven’t cured any of them yet. We had precision gene editing with designed zinc finger peptides since 1995. sangamo hasnt brought anything to market.  I’ll get excited when a cure for a Mendelian disease becomes mainstream and we have something other than a small molecule pipeline for biotech. Small molecules cost billions to get approved. What’s a genetic therapy going to cost? How do you do quality control etc. 

I’m more excited about synthetic biology in GMO’s. Companies like aqua bounty seem like a easier bet. Still they didn’t use AI, just popped a gene from one fish that lived in cold water into another fish and accidentally found it grew bigger faster. Optimized a little with random selection and 28 years later they were able to get approval and sold their first pound of salmon. 28 years!!!! Think about that. in biotech even after the discovery be it by AI or humans profits just take forever. 

Looking for verticals that have cheap approval paths and quick iteration times with synthetic bio. I haven’t found any.

Absolutely hate to discourage fellow wsb degens, but this one you got wrong. It went already to 250 as its peak and that was when CLX was at 110% capacity. You cannot sell more product if you cannot make more then your max and already tabbed other comps to manufacture more for you. But as always I hope for you to prove me wrong and laugh at converting my wining position to a losing put at the 200 strike currently ongoing till February.
For me i think it will keep dipping down overall with occasional smaller tops.
It’s not a bad game tho 86% metacritic for pc version and already 13 mil sales

It honestly is, especially if you can find something to keep yourself busy/make money in the off season. I make more than enough money during the 6-7 months we’re really open.
Buy long puts to cover your positions when it is “cheap” to buy? It reduces your gains slightly, but it protects you in a collapse

Either you're looking for advise or posting 100k gains/losses, you're still a fucking idiot.
You can put all your stacks of premium tendies into your pouches, too.
> I doubt Melvin will be the loser here

Pretty hard to further short something that's way over 100% shorted already. Their only immediate play would be to convince people to stop buying but that's going to be hard to do with no selling pressure.

Long term maybe they have enough under management to stay solvent until the price normalizes, although it's possible it levels out far above their short buy-in price and doesn't come back down for a long time.

I think they're so big that they've forgotten what it's like to be squeeze since normally they'd be able to buy their way out of it by throwing more cash at the problem. But this time they can't do that and weren't smart enough to capitulate to a small loss early, so they'll probably end up eating a big loss later.

Buying calls on everything so I can get a gene edited big dick so my wife will finally dump her boyfriend to be with me.
If what you mean by that is you couldn't commit to someone without any chance of betraying them until you finally learned the meaning of commitment at age 25, then... the type of woman who wouldn't be a gold digger is typically the type of person who's never felt ok with betraying anyone and knew what commitment meant the first time she ever did it and never abandoned her first partner. So if you didn't figure that stuff out until 25 don't you probably just deserve a gold digger?

Maybe I'm a bitter paranoid asshole and you shouldn't listen to me, idk
I CANT TAKE THIS ANYMORE!!!

💀
Still doesn’t explain the gain spike, when posting gain, positions supposed to be your winning move not current ones.
r/relationship_advice is that way retard ➡️
In general you are correct. Commons means common stock aka PSTH ticker.

For every 9 commons you buy and hold through the merger, you get 2 warrants at $23 pricing (you get the option to buy two more shares at a price of $23, regardless of what the stock trades at).

For example, if you buy 9 shares at 26 dollars and then the stock jumps to 100 on the announcement, you have 9 shares with avg price 26 and 2 extra shares avg price 23

Its an insane incentive to hold basically, ensuring a quality stock with mostly upside and no huge dumps like we see with every other IPO

The size of the SPAC and the CEO ensure that a sweet deal will be struck
About as good chance of a pullback on those as there is on SPY
I feel like all of this bullshit you are posting is just a way to trick a few dumbasses on here to send you dick pics. Seriously fuck off with this shit.

This makes me so freaking happy though.  It's like reverse-schadenfreude.  The fact that you and RK saw an opportunity like GME, even before the big names like Reggie, Burry and Cohen.  Not only that, you stuck to your guns even enduring public ridicule for investing in "tHe NeXt blOCkbUsTeR."  And, to add to the madness, you engaged with the community, breaking down your play to the fundamentals to us mouth breathers.  Hope you guys enjoy every cent you've made from GME 'cause you fucking deserve it.

Anyway, I'm done gushing.  Hope your Christmas was peaceful and may the new year bring you many 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are 100% correct, I meant the treatments that are being discovered haven't even been to market yet, giving us time to get in before they start doing numbers.  I see ARKG to 200 easily by end of 2021. I think what we are seeing now is some of these companies are going to really pop as more people are fighting over less outstanding shares. The second some of these treatments come to market then the average joe will jump in.
And with all of the places you could look for it you came here. 

This is not going to end well for you.

Well it will go down the price of the dividend ( 52¢)...but just wait it out a week.or so. Check out closing price history after ex-dividend a this past year. On all 4 ex-dividend dates this year, the price rebounded within 2 weeks.

Both. I had relationships in high school and uni. Then went a bit crazy and travelled and stuck my dick in anything that moved. That eventually got a bit boring and/or I calmed down a bit (never thought that would happen) and am now with a great girl who's incredibly supportive. Absolutely I prefer being with her than fucking around. But it's good I got it out of my system, and proved to myself whatever I needed to prove.

Also it helps that she's bi and cool with me doing some stuff on the side (either with her or without her). Choose wisely.

GME went from 11 to a high of 22 SPCE went from 22 to a high of 35.82. You just timed your comment after the SPCE dropped and GME popped, thats just playing dirty. GME will slide back down from this level and SPCE will pop again once they announce the next test flight window.

I actually took this guy’s advice and paid off my rental in 7 years and tried to pay off my own house. In 10 years, I still have 1 paid off rental property and good equity in house. However, my neighbor, who used to rent next door, followed a BRRRRR strategy (Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Rinse, Repeat) acquired more than 10 properties and now is multi-millionaire. I am nowhere near the velocity his assets have increased. Dave Ramsey teaches people how to be scared and not use other people’s money to leverage. He is the anti-Kiyosaki. It only works for those who does not have self-discipline or financial inclination to be successful in the future. Never again.

The trick is to do recon on the ones trading near NAV and see which, if any, are about to vote on a merger, or are likely to do so in the near future. Then the opportunity cost isn’t as much as a factor because you can expect a big runup within days, weeks, or months.

I'll give you an example. Everyone hates Comcast right? Stock is at an all time high. They have competition, but they still have market share and people still use their services.

So what is your point? People dislike GME so that means the share price should fall?? Don't say 'well nobody shops at GameStop anymore' cause then I'll have to show you their financial statements so you can look at their top line.

I agree on NVDA.... The NVDA pennant, with declining volume, is beautiful and clear.  Depending how you draw your pennant boundaries, it could see a breakout with any catalyst as early as early January,  or up to late February.   Both of those are before ER so maybe the catalyst will wait for ER?  If that's the case then calls should be no earlier than April or June to safely catch the breakout without a theta problem.

No because since the PS3 games will fully install on the consoles onboard storage even if you have the disc so storage issues are still there. It also takes a long while to install the game and any relevant patches so even if you go out and buy the disc you're probably going to be waiting around the same time. There is also no need to reserve a game if you buy it through the console's store which I said in my post is a big threat to Gamestop. I guess you are right though that you can pick up cheaper used games from Gamestop.

ILMN tried to buy out PACB and failed and then had to pay a fat fucking fine. I think they wanted out because they saw trouble on the horizon financially, but this doesn't mean they are out forever. There is some M&A consolidation that's bound to happen with the big boys here. The big gainers in this sector will be the new companies that pop up if we can get in on them before ARKG buys in, or before they get bought out.
Depends if you want TSLA exposure or not

The reason GME has generated interest here is because of a compelling short squeeze argument and because there’s a lot of millennial rtards here (your’s truly included) that have hated and shopped at GameStops for years if not decades- and would love to make a buck off them after selling their 2 month old games to them for pennies over the past decade.

Never have had anything
Gold digging is a learned behavior. Women start learning it between ages 14 to 18 and these days every woman over 20 who's experienced an unstable situation in her life has it in her arsenal of skills and uses it. To find a woman over 20 who doesn't gold dig and have her be romantically available is probably difficult because to have had a stable enough life since adolescence to never turn to gold digging she's probably had a committed partner since adolescence. So I think your best bet is to ask yourself if you're really a superior human being who deserves something better than a gold digger. If you are, I guess you have to date 16 year olds or something because you're way past the age where superior females commit to their partners. Otherwise, you might have to accept the flaws of typical adult women on the dating market.
Naa it’s fine I meet with my neighbor, we go on walks occasionally during lunch breaks. She jokes around about having a boyfriend and we have a quickie every time in her bed.

I'm eager to find out what Biden's plans are in the first 100 days. I'm thinking of FB puts even though I love the company and think long term they have the biggest self-provided data set on consumer behavior out there next to Google. With both of them in the antitrust crosshairs,  anybody brave enough to take out puts banking on more bad news?   


My theory is the second sleepy gets in he is confronted with a ton of shit that's been on the backburner or not released because it would embarrass Trump or the US. I'm thinking stuff like: scale of the hack, social media manipulation/coordination, devastating leaks about the zucc's communications with the president, hate speech/violence, livestreamed suicides, and bipartisan hate for internet tech companies.  I know timing puts is usually retarded but it's a fucking rush when you're right. I'm thinking we could see a 10% dinger here bringing it somewhere near 230. I would go all in if it were to take a dip down to 200 again.
I think ARKG has the best long-term potential. I have some experience in the editing/protein dev space so I could be biased.
Got it. Thanks
This is one of the most retard dd ive seen here. Say less, all in.
That's what i was asking lol
Yeah, I can't really find anything bad about SPACs besides opportunity cost from having money tied up in a SPAC that isn't doing anything. 

I know that SPACs can and do go under $10 in some cases but big upside, limited downside, seems almost too good to be true. I'm sure I'm missing something. Any anti-SPACers here, please enlighten me.
Do I buy GME on Monday start with a best price market buy order or wait an hour or two ?

The only way you could convince me to buy a Ford is if you told me most of the engineering team and management team had been replaced.

It's Jan 1, what distribution of my portfolio do I go ARKK/ARKG/PLTR?


I think ARKK is getting swamped with more money to invest which could mean a shift in strategy, might do 100% ARKG and hope for the best. PLTR is too sketchy on civil liberties for me tbh
Hey I used that word on here plenty o' times. And I swear, I swear, I have never sucked mods off.
Chewy and Bark Box are not the same. One is an online marketplace and e-commmerce platform, backed by Pets Mart. STIC is a blank check shell company looking to aquire a monthly subscription service that caters exclusively to dog owners. This could print, but the enthusiasm in these comments is not backed up by independent DD.
High life and Miller lite are both better usually drink craft beer but not deviating again

This is a good play.  It really depends on the tickers you are planning on.. If they are solid companies with good growth go OTM.  If they are a bit speculative go ITM.  How deep were you planning on going ITM?

Went from 10K to 20K in June. Lost it. Hovered around 5K down to about 2K a month ago. Got it back to 10K then up to 15K on ETF LEAPs. Suddenly realized an insane strategy. YOLO’d on ITM SPAC LEAP trading near NAV with max loss of 10%. Up 40K. Will be up 100+K in next 2 weeks. Gain porn on its way. 

Will never play anything but SPACs again. Literally an infinite money printer. You can YOLO on ITM SPAC LEAPS with minimal risk and the upside of an OTM weekly. 

Now go get rich and stop buying things up 500% in a week.
Good luck bro
When you’re done watching your wife get banged out by her bf, play more suited connectors, build a rep that’s hard to read by showing intentionally erratic moves, and be VERY selective with hands you risk your stack on.
You'll find that anyone who sticks around for any length of time is either good at trading or makes enough to keep refilling their account. Most people come here and hit one or two and then go broke and leave.
Best thing I've ever seen.

All the Intel I've seen says gme squeeze wont happen soon. It *should* be before April. 

What you need to do is double your money really quick, probably should/definitely use Margin and invest in some rando stonk like gev0 in a couple waaaaay ITM calls and then double up on both your gme and pltr positions when it moons.  Problem solved.

Question about gold diggers and marriage: currently 27 year old american male, turned 20k to 1.9 mil this year from tesla leaps. After years of rejection, I have finally built confidence to go after extremely attractive girls and even ask girls I have met that night for threesomes without caring if they reject me or not. So I will be going through a filtration process in the next coming years to find a mate. Long term I prefer to be monogamous and don't want to sign a prenup to prove that we will both be loyal to each other for life. Asking older guys, is it easy to spot these golddiggers, what are the signs or is it obvious. I like nice things, and like to take girls out to nice places and buy them designer like prada, and louis and have a nice place. Should I hide these clues of wealth? What say you?

> Roth IRA withdrawal rules differ depending on whether you take out your contributions or your investment earnings. Contributions are the money you deposit into an IRA, while earnings are your profits. Both grow tax-free in your account.

> You can withdraw your Roth IRA contributions at any time, for any reason, with no tax or penalties. That's because you make contributions with after-tax dollars, so you've already paid taxes on that money.

Haha same shit happened to my brother-in-law. Was a builder building on spec at the time. Was building his largest home ever on spec (2008-2009), we all told him he was a retard. Re-financed his paid off 1.5mm residence to pay for what needed finishing after the bank wouldn't loan him anymore.

Bank basically collapses in 2009, brings in new CEO, new CEO calls the loans on the commercial shit that he thinks is at risk. Short sold it. New CEO of the bank bought it at the short sale for 40% less than the 5.5 mil my brother-in-law had it in and for breakeven for the bank basically at that point.

Some fun sketchy shit out there.
I’ve got some wagyu steaks in the fridge and then some gold plated carrots

It also incentivises shareholders to hold for a longer period of time. Because they are "more" vested in the new company. If this goes well, which I think it well, I could see him doing something like this every few years.
I’ve done it and while your right about the size they did borrow a considerable amount of debt on the M&A just for this subpar service that may or may not be adopted as a main stream.

If you think any part of that was sarcasm then puts on your relationships
Yeah. My thought process ( open to being told I’m retarted ): I’ll be spending the same amount either way, would just be buying more OTM contracts if going that way.

The ITM would theoretically lose value slower, giving me time to exit at a loss vs dropping to totally worthless with a small movement down.

I haven’t actually tried this yet, though I’ve back tasted it with some simulations just to see how different LEAPs behave when prices drop and it seems like the ITM ones you get that little buffer, especially if you pay the premium to go deep ITM.

It’s def not as sexy as OTM and the gains that come when you do that - and I’m not sure if this is even the smartest way to hedge. It’s def possible a better approach is a call spread with the long side OTM so I have that sold short side for the same reason.
Wait, you all’s got jobs?

sell cc. if it pops you can make an easy 20%. if it does nothing you collect the premium.

example. buy 1k shares of psth at 26 for 26k. sell jan 15th 30c for $1.

1) if it pops. you make $4k + $1k premium. that is $5k on a $26k investment in 3 weeks. 

2) if it trades sideways you made $1k.

3) if stock tanks 5% ish you break even.

No stimmy until after Jan 20.
I literally started because WSB had a post about some guy making stupid money that hit the popular tab under a month ago, I started December 8th. It was my first time ever seeing the sub. The comments were hilarious, and then when I saw that calling people retards and autists was okay here, I immediately downloaded Robin Hood, watched some YouTube videos, and invested 200 bucks in whatever stupid stocks this sub was talking about.

The only one I haven’t bought into was GameStop.

Tell that to the high savant autist Michael Burry as well as several other hedge funds who see GME as a value play. Options are risky, but going long shares at these prices makes sense. In any case, I doubt Plotkin himself is trading GME. It's a tiny drop in their overall AUM. It's more likely some rookie flunkie who's gonna be out of a job soon. Plotkin has bigger worries like his large BABA position.

Dunno, I think this is significant enough for a pullback over the next 2-3 weeks. personally gonna wait to deploy additional cash for a little bit.
There are still people it works for, I don’t buy it. I have my debit and credit card with Chase. On the mobile app I immediately pay off every purchase the second I make it. I only buy shit I need to live and if I’m going out then I will spend money to have fun regardless because I can afford to. At no point does having a credit card encourage me to spend more because it’s a pseudo debit card the way I use it. 

Shit even the Amazon one is 5% cash back. I just buy things I need on Amazon and save the 5%. I’m sure there is truth to the studies, but for me personally I know it’s working in my favor.

Oh man.. if you want to chat send me a message anytime.  It was very worth it.. just the discipline part alone.. then the mental sharpness and the better fitness.  Working out is just easier whenever I want to..
So, thus far that’s what I’ve been doing for options. My thought is for LEAPs buying ITM even though more expensive will act more like buying the stock on leverage. So, less gain for sure - but potentially more time to sell and cut losses if Apple starts crashing.

Think that’s stupid? I guess you could argue that if I’m gambling over buying stocks I may as well buy OTM and actually gamble for a better risk/reward spread.

Brahs, this is what I’ve been trying to tell you guys for MONTHS, started back at $65. All I get is mouth breathers saying “iPad on a bike”, you don’t know how hyped ppl get, it’s infectious, hard to pay a price on that!
It didn't stop though, not even close, and that supply went fast. I'm a machinist, we've had a more difficult time than usual getting steel the last 6 months.
Are you holding thru the merger?
watching this shit tearing up thinking about how much many fucking tendies this means
When does $5M per month for them starts hurting?
Is it too much to ask for both
this is the best dd I've seen all day
My left nut is lower than my right nut should I sell?
Op fucks
But you did the leg work, and that’s what counts.
Ya but my platinum card goes clinkity clink whenever I drop it. Can't do that with cash.
SCHD with drip as a second source of income for retirement.
I borrowed 25K two years ago from my parents to go all in on a pharma stock that was trading at $1. Got FDA, ran to $2 then did an offering and proceeded to tank to $.5. Held for months in the hope that it would run back up but decided to cut my losses and invest the 12.5K in some other stuff. Did stocks here and there and learned about options. It's a pay to learn type of environment and I was down to $2k at one point.  I yoloed it all on TGT calls on earnings. Made 10K off it, and did TSLA here and there and got more and more comfortable. I managed to make back what I borrowed from my parents and enough to max ira/invest for fun.

Do you just sort by top for the day?
market ran up like crazy so theres a bunch of unrealized gains and no one wants to realize a gain before the year is over
The alternative being what? Slaving away at a shit job for shit pay to pay a shirt ira to live in a shit condo in shit country florida after 40 years?
I played the last four. Made some money. I’m looking at Zscaler
If we scored when we were able there would be way too much time. It’s much more likely a team can drive and score a TD with 1:40 than do what they just did. I think you’re using hindsight quite a bit.
No pton way too far ahead.
No
I’m with you on that, it happened so fast

That will be my entry point
This is the way.
True. Except he didn't give a timeline of years. That quote is not accurate. The rest is true. PSTH will not end up with spacex or starlink though. This thing is being announced in January.
We’re a dying breed, brother

Wonder Woman just released on the app.  That will do great things for Apple and T.  Calls on both.
Believe it or not, yea - that's how the final battle was won.
haha sure, and in your dreams!
MBA programs are successful because the people that choose to go there are either 1. going there in order to check off a box for management, 2. well connected *before* they entered or 3. work their ass off. In fact if you end up in a nasty personal situation + shitty hiring world like in March, a MBA degree will make you... less desirable for entry level jobs.  It has almost no correlation to programs compared to undergrad reputation. *Maybe* Harvard and Stanford will allow you to goof off, but not the rest of them. Good luck.
anyone want to make SCR the new meme stock and go all in with me pls
The health monitoring features (heart rate, ECG, O2 level) are neat. I workout often, so see the charts on active versus resting levels is interesting. The calling with the device is actually really nice. Texting is a different story, but still doable. I guess I can also use it as my car keys and prep the car before leaving. I understand that most, if not all, could be done with an Android equivalent. I already have an apple phone, so I decided to keep the OS consistent to get the most out of my devices.
What trade did you lose 4K on?
Yessir, capital gains tax ability in march will sell off a large portion their and park in cash
What idiot decided that disco inferno was not the song for this
If you think about all the super successful hedge funds with highly trained, experienced traders, many of whom are struggling to navigate this environment, while a bunch of newbie traders on WSB are killing it making a ton of money, it starts to reveal itself that, trading success is not something you can build upon and rely on to continue.  It’s not a linear or exponential growth path, more like a sine wave. One year you can be on top of the world, the next year you could have lost is all because the market has changed and no longer fits what you know.

It doesn’t hurt to give exposure and to provide the right kind of guidance, but even though I just had one of my better outcomes the last 6 weeks, turning 30k into 280k, it doesn’t feel like I accomplished anything, and it could all just be gone a year from now.  

I’ve been reading since 1999, I’ve made and lost hundred of thousands and even millions.  I probably would have done better for myself if I just focused on a career path, be it finance or in tech, saved away money, and invested into good company. Buy and forget
You......dont have HBO MAX already?  It is by far the best streaming service, bar none.  Rick and Morty alone was enough to convince me.

There has been research into that. It turns out if you had invested in index funds you would have DOUBLE the profit after 15 years - that's how much drag those extortionate fees add.
GME. Just buy and hold. Also leaps on PERI and SOL. Or if you want something safer, leaps/shares of BOTZ, ICLN, ROKT, and CIBR
Cut a hole in the middle and then partnership with fleshlight.
I would delete it anyway and re download around mid January
Yeah, but don't get me started on the owls.
good job fellow autist, nio is going to skyrocket, next month is NIO day and maybe a big fruity announcement
1. Invest your emergency fund  
2. Pay off margin calls  
3. Invest until you are financially god status or homeless

Man the craving for beer gets insane after a while. I’ve had a few sober stints and the first beer is always the best damn thing you’ll ever drink. Unfortunately I am getting to the point where I need to call it a wrap so I don’t die and whatnot
Why use many word when few word do trick?

Have you considered buying high and selling low?
lol you haven't broken Cramer....he knows you're being risk taking idiots.....and he points that out right after he acknowledges you don't give a shit about pe multiples. 

When this turns, and it will, he'll be all up in your face with "I warned you". 

You autists better hope they ring a bell at the top.
😂
I feel your so much smarter with plays when winning then retarded when you start losing
😂😂😂
Cheers!  🍻
Oh my gawd.. I found her.
This p word looks unfamiliar to me as well. Are we trying to look fancy using French?
Boobs are better then asses
I've learned many skills, but it's all unofficial.  My talent is figuring shit out and learning how to do new things.  It turns out, everyone puts that on a resume (I've been a hiring manager for many years, I know what my resume looks like).

Fair point...
bird pussy. all in baby.
Weird. Fucking pigeons always up to no good
to make it, u gotta be some type of lucky, genius, or just well placed and skilled and focused at the right time or place

otherwise being above average won't cut it
You SOB I'm in
Pls be footlong. My 100k is in footlong
wut mate? those fkboy skate boards? lol may be
You should have done the DD in March when it was 0.19.  Why now when it’s off the chart?
Shouldn't this be flaired shitpost?
It’s been a shit show since before ... well since ever.  But, they somehow still keep coming up with a great dividend and continuous cash flow.  


It’s like saying WSB is full of retards, sure, you’d be right, yet somehow the stonks still go up! Don’t bet against the house, don’t bet against TSLA, and don’t bet against WSB.
You must like precious person's poontang
Ok. But how much is the explosion going to cost them short term/long term? Short term they have to fix the building in Nashville and get everything back up and running. Long term - Probably have to then spend $ on revamping building security to prevent these type of things from happening again - then execute the plan. While they may have dividends on the 9th what’s that forward guidance? More money out the door = less toward dividend. 

Just something to keep in mind.
What do people think about buying actual ITM LEAPs on AAPL. So, like Jan 2022 maybe 2 dollars ITM.
I’ll manage it. I’m a known commodity here

My friend told me that SolarWinds got hacked and is a parent company to SunGard. He told me that the bombing destroyed the SunGard building, and the reason they made those announcements is because no one was to be hurt. Maybe... is he telling the truth? 

Also FEYE 1/8 23c and 1/22 25c I’m geeking.

I have 1k shares since Nov and have been selling weekly CC on it to lower my cost basis. 

If I am wrong then I lose a little bit of money. the bottom is $20.

If I am right then this becomes a 5-10 bagger over the next few years.  

FYI- dont think it will be spce x but could  Starlink come into play . PSTH has a 2 year deadline. 

Elon tweet yesterday

" We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth & predictable. Public market does \*not\* like erratic cash flow haha. **I’m a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it**. "

Who the fuck is buying TSLA lol

I see a good amount on the road but really not that many.
This is bullshit all the tickers have been trading sideways since Christmas eve. SPY hasn't even changed its still 3692!

RIGGED!
Co worker mentioned PLTR and then gave me the sauce on how he found out.

I’ve been profitable ever since
It should do a direct listing. Doubt banks would back it, cause of the porn factor.
“Scroll down for more episodes of mandem’s disastrous life!”
To be honest, it’s not a very popular strategy especially this year because generally people either go for the long term gains or they go for bigger short term plays but I have a lower risk tolerance and I’m okay with smaller steadier gainz. I do it every year to recoup Christmas spending and usually I have a bit left over to buy my wife something nice for Valentine’s Day, not that I have to worry about somebody from Wall Street Bets fuckin her while I’m at work. I don’t lose, I only win 🤑🤑🤑
I get it.

Current fanboy who rode this sToNk to tendie town both ways.  Just waiting for a nice dip to get back in - really just waiting for Cohen to announce takeover.
ya as long as its not painted.
A beer sounds great.. and these past few weeks I've thought about drinking more than I did the entire rest of the year first in the first couple weeks of December since my last drink was 13 December of last year so that made a year and **fear of success** etc etc and I thought to myself okay I did this I can drink if I want.  But the goal was for the full calendar year and so here I am.  Cravings for a beer are less than they were at the beginning of December but still more than they were the rest of the year and that is the fear of success paradox right there.
Final week of 2020. Likely the final day
It’s a fucking flamethrower dude are you retarded
Yeah if you find yourself struggling like that its a good place to start I was/am the same way.  Get yourself a budget and structure for even the non Essentials.  You don't have to follow everything he says but a budget and staying away from debt go a long way.
Grow two fingers back on my left hand
Anyone here in XL? How long to hold this thing?
Can’t save your way to being big baller

Never going back. So much more energy.
What defines a big dick? I haven’t seen any in person, and I do well with women. “Big dick energy” is some beta shit phrase cop out
I’ve jerked off whilst being too nervous to look at it
what do you do for a living?
No.  Really.  I don't have anything social, good or bad.
Damn that’s pretty genius. You would think that they would require you to be a shareholder for an x amount of time to qualify for dividends so this kind of thing wouldn’t happen. It’s sounds too easily exploitable

Thanks - This looks like an interesting investment.  I think the April calls make sense and will give you plenty of time to see how this progresses. Company has been beat down - but is coming back strong. Best of luck to you!
For tiny sums of money the penalty was waived, not for general withdraws.
It’s my birthday boys!!!
> Yeah I hear ya. I’m just picturing some young kid who doesn’t know the first thing about money or investing. And he got some hot tip and figures this is how Warren Buffett started out. I feel a little bad for the poor guy.

Yeah Warren Buffet got his humble beginnings in cryptocurrency in the 1960s. These people are infinitely more retarded than OP.
Next time give me the 20k+ problem solved
I never take profit
If I was you I’d walk away for a sec wish I did at 10k now at 4k
I dont give a fuck what Trump's motivation is, I just want the 2000 dollars.
What are the next sectors Apple will get into besides EV. My guesses are...   
1. Banking - proper one. no goldman backed.   
2. Gaming - Console quality games that you can play on your M1 powered systems.   
3. Search engine - bye bye google.   
4. VR headsets
That’s some shit to be going through my dood. Sorry to hear. I’m super lucky to have work even though it’s 1/2 what it used to be. It’s rough as shit out there. Been thinking about school too! But yeah. Doing anything’s better than doing nothing. Don’t let your autist wsb readin brain convince you otherwise.

What other stocks can we add to the $SIMP etf?
Hey, shush. Hold off until I get my positions.
How can you be an "expert" and advise people in good faith to invest in mutual funds instead of index funds.. It's completely retarded - it's a settled science already!
That will be the true dip
Yah true forgot that you can take estrogen pills to shrink your dick off
