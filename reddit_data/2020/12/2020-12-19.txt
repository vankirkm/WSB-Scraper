Teachers? I‚Äôm talking about PhDs at universities doing research work. They get paid a fraction of what they‚Äôd make if they decided to do similar work in the private sector. If they wanted more money, taking a bribe while doing low-pay work would not be a reasonable way to do it. They‚Äôd just go get a high-paying job.

Small salaries for lawmakers mever work. You need a substantial salary to prevent bribes and similar thing and attract people who are competent enough. Nobody wants to do a hard job for no monet reagrdless of how much they love their people.

Above fair value however. Yes you will probably still make a lot of money - my projection is that we see similar performance to last 6 months on these stocks assuming printer and stimulus are intact.

Which would mean a ~33% return or so by June which even at 1.10 is a ~400% return.

These are not a 0 risk play though. A significant correction in the market in the next 6 months could easily blow these up so don't load up on them unless you acknowledge the risk and aren't putting in money you can't afford to lose.

Options calculators are going to fuck with you man. Your expected return should literally be zero while you're learning, and then MAYBE slightly more than that once you get good. Those gains posts you see, there is no skill in winning the lottery. 

You really think 40-60% ROI is realistic? I know you used the word "optimistic" but you are talking hallucinatory fantasy if you think that's what you'll average. The best hedge funds in the world will maybe do 20% in their best years but a "good" year is still single digits.

Use options calculators to figure out strikes after you already have a play thought out in your head. Place your plays based on what will lose you the least amount of money, not what will multiply the highest in the event of a biblical level miracle.

There's 1.7 million people subbed and even more just browsing. How many 10k+ gains posts get posted a day?

Only do options with an amount of money you're okay with losing. I don't do more than 5-10 percent of my portfolio for short dated things and only if I really understand what I'm doing, which, let's be honest, I don't, because this is a degenerate gambling subreddit.

At peak autism, maybe one in a thousand posts here are good, the other 999 are on the level of people who think they can get rich flipping Nikes on StockX. If you've ever been in Atlantic City or Vegas and saw somebody so degenerate that you truly pitied them, imagine that is WSB's target demo. 

You are not in good company here and the odds are stacked heavily against you. Good luck.

I lose money. What‚Äôs it to you?
It‚Äôs run up a lot. My original cost basis is around $2.50/share. I‚Äôve written enough covered calls on it to get it almost negative
Delta is time value

Higher the delta basically the more in the money the call is


Expected value is

Gain(probability of gain) - loss (probability of loss)

Now there isnt a great way to get the exact metrics, but when you sell a call or a put it tells you probability it expires OTM

So you can use those values and a little more math

But basically, say I do a 370/371 debit call spread on SPY. And it costs me $80, with a max return of 100, so a gain of 20.

So if the probability of spy ending over 371 is 70%, and above 370 is 80%

Now technically break even is 370.80.

So .7(20) - .2(80)

You can account for the other 10% but honestly to drunk ATM

So 1.4 minus 1.6, that's negative EV, so I wont make that trade. I ONLY trade positive expected value


Imagine roulette. It has 38 options. But pays 35 to 1. So if you play 38x, you should win 35$ and lose $37. For a total loss of 2$, or basically lose 5.5% of a dollar every bet you make of $1. I ain't playing that game

If it paid 40 to 1, I would make that bet, because every 38 spins I should make 3$, or a positive EV

I trade any spread (debit or credit, call or put) with a positive EV

So UK on lockdown/new virus mutation, states getting less vaccines than expected, small businesses fucked, stimy not happening. We are going to be fucking green again on Monday arent we?
I like to sell spreads that are way otm that they‚Äôll basically never get assigned. While it is possible that the stock decreases and you lose the entire collateral, if you don‚Äôt yolo like a dumbass it‚Äôs still a pretty good deal for the risk your taking. For example I keep selling weekly spreads like amzn 2870/2860 puts and that gives you like 4-5% instead of the like .5% you‚Äôd get for selling cash secured puts. But yeah I do that with margin up to half the value of the shares in my account and it‚Äôs a pretty nice passive income. The only time it didn‚Äôt workout was when I got greedy and tried to yolo with spy puts that weren‚Äôt that far otm and then the next day was the June 11 crash and I got fucked. Took a while to make that back but finally did 2 months ago. So yeah do it but just don‚Äôt be greedy

Still wrapping my head around coming from stock to options..
Oh aight, I gotchu. Basically a warrant works similarly to an option, but for one share and usually with one specific expiration date, with both the share and specifications coming from the company: in terms of the process, the simplest thing would probably be to contact your broker to exercise your warrants. You‚Äôll probably have to pay a fee of some kind, but I‚Äôm not sure about that part

They're both done in different situations, like I described. But regular lump sum investing outperforms DCA with more variance. So you might choose to reduce risk by DCA'ing a large amount of cash, but you should always invest money from your paychecks in full.

Yeah but you need to go to 177 1/2 Bleeker and run real fast into the wall
eat more. If you think you're eating enough, you are not.
A large enough price swing will make the option price increase rapidly. An example, when moderna shot up to $180 a couple weeks ago on vaccine hype, I bought a $120p weekly, and the stock price fell hard and fast. As a result, my put value increased 250% in about 3 hours without ever going itm. Most here are trading high iv weeklies hoping for that rapid price movement in the underlying to get those 5x-10x gains. More fail than succeed.
Under the 2012 STOCK act all their trades are disclosed within 30 days. You can see that generally there is no obvious insider trading.

99.99% of people who say they can't gain/lose weight are not eating as much/little calories they think.

If they track their 100% daily calories accurately, their weight would change.

Metabolism rate between 96% of people fall within the same +/-10%.

A couple tea spoon of oil is already 180cal. Most people are fucking clueless. Counting calories is all you need to change your weight

Only if people continue to value work as unequal from other types.

You think fast food isn‚Äôt a job?  Then you don‚Äôt get to eat there anymore?  Waitress isn‚Äôt real work?  You don‚Äôt get that kind of restaurant either.

Teachers look down on mechanics and vice versa.

Every single job has someone else looking down on it.

You work an oil rig?  Fucking moron.  Your job isn‚Äôt equal to the suit in the trailer on site.

I see that dude at the gas station far more than I‚Äôve seen any dentists.   Why is that tooth nerd getting so much?  Seems a lot easier than the physical labor is see that kid doing lifting crates of Mt Dews.

In the end, we actually all need each other equally.  Things you don‚Äôt use, someone else needs.  Things you want, other people laugh at.  Once people figure that out and get rid of the pettiness of greed, we‚Äôll be two steps forward.

Yeah so you‚Äôd only lose the full price of the premium if your contract expires out of the money (OTM). If you can sell to close before then then you can make some of your money back. But calls will lose value the closer it is to the expiration date due to something called theta decay so it‚Äôs best to sell for profits well before it expires

I guess to your point what I am not entirely sure with all this AI story is that if it needs to get continuously updated for use, then how do regulators/companies determine the older version is safe to use to begin with. What I understand is that AI is something that needs to get constantly updated based on data, challenge here is that you are carrying people's lives here (as opposed to targeting ads) so there needs to be an infliction point where the full autonomous driving AI software should be at a point where it is certainly 100% safe to use. Because if it is not, then the technology fails until it reaches to that point. If it does reach out to that point, then how difficult for others to get to that point or use similar technology and how sustainable will TSLA's advantage be. But again the question always lingers which is the monetization part of all that.

Say you have X actuarial liability for retiree healthcare. You get your pet actuary to say its X/2. Than you set up a UAW trust and put X/2 into it to fund the retiree healthcare. Now the liability is off your books. If UAW complains the money is not enough you promise to backstop the trust if the money runs out. As far as books are concerned you only have a liability to backstop which is difficult to quantify. In any case its off yr books. Now you dont need to keep setting aside money for retiree healthcare and your cashflow is now positive. You can use the cashflow to do buybacks and the share price rises. Interestingly enough some of the money you put into the trust was as shares of the company so now the funding of the trust is also higher. Everybody stops worring about it . C suite folks get their bonuses based upon raising the stock price.

10 years down the line we have a recession. The shares crash. The company goes crying to the company for a bailout and says to the govt we cant refinance in the private markets if this backstop is still on s. Can the PBGC takeover the backstop or we will have to layoff thousands of voters in your districts.

Risne , repeat, profit till the day your company starts doing badly without a recession. This time the govt is not worried about layoffs as TSLA will hire the laid off workers and lets your company go bankrupt. Suddenly all the off book liabilities come out of the woodwork and you realize the company has been bankrupt for 20 years. But the Execs are long retired and have invested their golden parachutes into TSLA stock.

wait for the SWI knife to stop dropping and confirmation of consolidation before buying.
Yep seems pretty good OP! Just one question... were TSLA? been searching for awhile.
Haven't skiied since the late 90s.  Haven't seen a single helmet being worn.

Guys get your shit together. There is no stimy until the market tanks. They can't just keep pumping. I bet they *want* to give the poors money, but they can't without breaking the stock market and taking it to 20% for the year during a global fuucking shutdown / pandemic. The situation is fucked. We are the ones stopping the stimy. If we all switch to bear gang and drive the market down. We can actually make a difference in the world and help the poors get their stimy.

Do it for the poors.
Haha ya this city is a ghetto dump in a lot of places
Well, not really IMO. I've seen rich peeps that'll sell their souls for an extra thousand. They'll add grandma as a bonus.

Try the muscle building program on the app Centr.... shit works
You‚Äôre really stuck on this moneyless thing..


Yes, I‚Äôd say like.. 70% of people would move markets if given the chance.  ^(Hence why I‚Äôm a Marxist...). But no, I do not think jobs are going to go empty.

The man who shovels cow shit wants to take a try at being a librarian, cause he thought that was gonna be easier.. indoors, inventory, silence..  turns out work is work and he finds it tedious.  

The librarian he replaced also left.  He wanted to be a line cook cause he been watching Gordon Ramsey hardcore.  It‚Äôs intense as fuck, but he loves it.

Which is good, cause a young woman was stuck being a line cook because she lacked the funds to go to college.. but with the free Ed, she‚Äôs now an architect.

And the old boomer who had been an architect for a few decades decided he wants to call the office suits and go work outdoors.  Somewhere with some old school work.  Like shoveling cow shit.

And he doesn‚Äôt mind tossing turds because he didn‚Äôt lose anything.  In fact, he gained peace of mind.  Everyone turned out happier.

Also, I‚Äôm really into this ‚Äúrecycle old cars for newer ones‚Äù idea to help with climate change.  Again, with no money, no one loses.  You wanna keep your VW bus?  Fine hippie. But when you‚Äôre ready, a program is set up to make the trade efficient.  

And also, ‚Äúthe homeless are a lost labor force that would probably go hard if you promised them a slick middle class existence prize with no strings attached.‚Äù

A lot of homeless dislike the system and refuse to participate.  A lot of them are just mentally unstable and didn‚Äôt get the help they needed..... free healthcare.... 

All of capitalisms problems are solved via communism... bro, that is literally what communism was built on.  Fixing what capitalism didn‚Äôt do.

History is a long line of advancements.  Tribes, Barter, Feudal, Capitalism ... Communism is next.

3. Buy TSLA calls
Exactly. The concern is in the context of wsb‚Äôs popularity and Robinhood being in the news recently for ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù customers. 

I‚Äôm prob worried for nothing, but I‚Äôm agreeing w you and adding that it could be bad if enough dildos cry about losing their gramma‚Äôs money thinking they could YOLO themselves onto a yacht ‚Äúbecause wsb and robinhood made it look easy!‚Äù 

There‚Äôs a reason it says ‚Äúyou might die‚Äù (paraphrased) on your Disney-world ticket. Litigious assholes.
Also because Porsche came in like a stealth ninja in the night and more than doubled its position prior to inclusion refusing to sell as well. They made something like 10 billion off their trade
For me, I‚Äôd only be ok with ‚Äúlosing‚Äù 200 bucks on calls. So I‚Äôd only ever be doing that. I‚Äôve never done options but I do kinda understand it. But with a 1$ premium, I‚Äôd only buy 2 contracts. And I‚Äôm not sure if that risk profit makes sense on options or if it‚Äôs better to just trade stocks.

you could've posted a link from august, or september, or october, or november and it still would've worked
Been doing some research in B F T, in for 500 shares and most likely will be buying another 200-300 if it dips Monday.

Psfe owns skrill and Neteller which is responsible for 80% of all gambling transactions,

I just can‚Äôt see this under $40 in a year. Assuming the market is still in easy Mode
They‚Äôll buy homes cash and drive up home prices
TSLA is like AMZN before it started offering cloud services (AWS).
What fight?
They make good money and get access to sticks before things happen. There's a reason they are in politics.  Laws to reduce would help.
I'm just glad that we're honest about this in 2020.  I recall in 2000 that everyone actually believed their bullshit lol.

So the Nasdaq 100 are the biggest non-finance stocks. i.e very tech heavy but some non-tech names too.

QQQJ basically tracks Nasdaq 101-200. These are a lot of the companies jockeying to be promoted to Nasdaq 100. Stuff like Roku, Atlassian, Crowdstrike, TTD. However again it also contains a bunch of non-tech stuff, in-fact it's much more diversified than the Nasdaq 100 (which is super tech heavy), it has stuff from all sectors, pharma/biotech, logistics, industrials, etc. Mostly growth stage mid-cap stocks but also some older companies that are potentially doing interesting things too.

The bulk of the stocks are actually members of the Nasdaq Q-50 index if you want to check their historical performance.

So who should buy and hold this? I would say anyone looking for exposure to the risker but higher growth potential mid-caps on the Nasdaq. Especially if your portfolio already contains QQQ then adding QQQJ is a no-brainer to make your allocation a bit more aggressive.

Separately from all of this when options were made available this ETF was flying under the radar so a few WSB retards picked up some insanely cheap June options, like 0.2 june 21 35c. This gravy train appears to have left the station though, these options are now above their fair value of 0.98 by a whole 12 cents.

That overlooks bailouts of 2008 and that the EV credits are incentivizing Big ICE to creating vehicles that are minimizing the environmental debt. Cars should currently (and previously) cost as much as an EV in order to take into account the costs to offset environmental repercussions.  
  
Virtually every ice vehicle ever made, is paid for with 2 loans, 1 in cash and 1 against the environment. The environmental loan is to be paid by future generations starting in earnest with Gen Y/Z.

But whose to say that your friend doesn't have a massive vitamin D deficiency or some kind of hormonal problem that has nothing to do with covid? 

Here is an example: Guy gets covid vaccine, and gets bells palsy. Bells palsy just happens sometimes. Media says it has nothing to do with vaccine. We accept it. On the other hand. Guy gets covid. Gets over it. But becomes very low energy. Media runs with it. No one looks into it.. and that's it. End of story.

No option premium will likely go down, it will decay as option maturity date becomes closer. An exception is if the stock market price stdv and volume rise sharply, which will increase implied volatility, which is also a large factor. In general, however, index fund etfs have low sensitivity. Meaning you are not missing out waiting for a correction. People are getting fooled because the etf share price was scaled down to $30 (QQQ is like $ 300, spy is like $369). People are failing to realize the option premium doesn't actually mean anything, its a reflection of the share price and option Greeks. What really matters is the option Greeks. They are nothing particularly special here, actually worse than SPY / QQQ. The only rationale I guess I've seen here is the index will outperform the broader market? I mean good luck, I haven't looked at all 100 holdings, but I guess that could be valid?

Like I said, this just causes less qualified people to pursue the position. Why don‚Äôt we haze them by making them eat shit and get fucked in the ass by a horse before they swear in. Other wise very qualified people would not take the risk of running an expensive and exhaustive political campaign to make little income and be separated from your family leaving the public with less options for political candidates along with lower quality candidates. If I want a heart surgery I‚Äôm nit going to pay someone minimum wage to do the operation. By keeping salaries higher than average you incentive more capable people to run for office. I‚Äôd prefer Congress people to be paid a lot more than average so we get more people running and more competition for congressional seats.

Right. Like my guy what is you doing
Walgreens stock is down because it's seen as a brick and mortar. Amazon is jumping into pharmacy and the concern is that they will consistently take market share until Walgreens stores can no longer afford the rent.

It's just a tough business model when you are paying for high value real estate and competing with a company like Amazon which is more efficient and has its distribution centers in the middle of nowhere. 

Walgreens will get a boost from the covid vaccines, but that will be nothing but a temporary spike in store traffic with no real long term impact.
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me

True. But we also need to realize that ‚Äúnot dead‚Äù is not the same as ‚Äúno big deal.‚Äù  I personally know a 30- something that caught it a few months ago, and is struggling to exercise at all.

He should sell and put it in NIO. Same company and they don't have the RnD expenses. Also they have access to a monster population of people that will favor them over TSLA. Turn that 10k into a 100 mil.

That sounds like Insider Trading, but if you run an official account that leaks inside info, I don't think it's still insider trading because following publicly listed advice, from someone who's publishing insider information, it's arguably declassified.

Dude the volumn on the ETF doesn't really mean shit. The price is calculated from the underlying assets NAV, which each have respective volumes that combine to make the actual ETF volumn useless. The reason the etf has gone up is because the underlying assets have. You can't "pump" an index etf, you would need Hundreds of Billions, its a freaking index.

You do realize a phone number is 10 digits, right? Fuck off, you don't have over a billion dollars.
That‚Äôs not a good things for banks. Traditional Banks profit from the spread of deposit rates to interest income. Also, a 2% asset write down would obliterate most of the equity because leverage cuts both ways.
It‚Äôs a pennant but you can tell it‚Äôs going to break up because the delta on the calls are breaking .3 while the puts are closer to .1, this combined with the volume on the richter curve have a combined value greater than 1 which tends to have an up trend of at least 68% on average.  However due to the ratio on the spreads with the same gamma we might not go past 35$ so it‚Äôs still risky.  Also nothing is 100% so we still have a 18% chance to go down because of the valuation curve is under the machete curve for the week by about 10% of the stock price.

Since you‚Äôre proposing a make believe land I‚Äôm doing the same. In mine the robots are owned by the govt which is run by the people, the robots do every single job except for govt jobs and it‚Äôs pretty much that simple. The people do whatever they want while droids fulfill our every need and desire. There‚Äôs no rich or poor bc everyone has what they want.
First step is no alcohol or weed before bed (I don't know enough about weed, but alcohol is best to cut off at least 3 or 4 hours before). Next, I'd try Magnesium supplementation (possibly along with L-theanine and/or Tryptophan), then melatonin if no response to those supplements after a couple weeks or so. Lots of research suggests that microdoses of melatonin actually more effective, so start that with the smallest dose you can find. [Examine.com](https://Examine.com) is a good place to read up.

With this same logic, if i create a S&P500 etf of the 100 companies below the 500 largest, same as QQQJ with Nasdaq, then scale back the share price to $5, you will think the options are "dirt cheap", as they will be like $20 for June calls. The math does not make sense, the smaller share price is fooling you, the IV is almost double index funds for simular options.
And cheaper expense ratio. It's actually not that bad. TTD/CRWD are top tickers in it.

My previous employer had me clear every single option trade because I didn‚Äôt have visibility into their portfolio, luckily it didn‚Äôt take more than 2 minutes to get a green light but with options, seconds can cost thousands. Also I had a refresher course on insider trading every year (2 hours) and another legal course, dealing with sensitive information (2 hours), then careful communications (3 hours), then ethics (3 hours). 

Congress can‚Äôt trade on confidential information directly about a company but they can literally trade an oil stock if they know for example the military is going to do a air strike in X location because it‚Äôs considered speculative, or maybe load up on some lockheed if we‚Äôre about to start a war, ban coal?

Generally "opens up" refers to discerning the individual flavour notes in the whiskey. Here he is saying a little dilution helps with that. But you could also use it to describe a phase in the experience, like "it really opens up when paired with a cigar".

As for the why:

Water helps here because it lowers the ABV.
This doesn't drastically dilute the flavours vs what your saliva is doing but avoids overwhelming your palate to do so.
Not really true actually, but the bigger part of a vegan play is the growing number of people not necessarily being vegan but looking for alternatives.

I think a person representing people should make no more than the average median income of the people they represent but no more than the person higher than them.  In example the mayor of New York City can‚Äôt make more than the governor.  All the way down to state representatives.  That would make this a push to get more jobs in places and this would be a monthly salary.  Any other time this wouldn‚Äôt matter so much but during the pandemic you would‚Äôve seen swift action

First off, you‚Äôre misunderstanding.  It‚Äôs not that ‚Äúeveryone gets paid the same.‚Äù   Moneyless means no money. None. No one is getting paid.  There‚Äôs no currency.  The only barter is that you work.

For the hypothetical but true dude, he could easily get out of the position he hates and find something he digs.  Not sure if you read the comment you responded to....?  Literally a Marx quote about it.. 

Some people enjoy different things.  I have a friend who works hard labor all the time and tells me he could never do food or retail because of some weird ‚Äúhonor‚Äù he has (he‚Äôs a drunk with pancreatitis in Nowhere Kansas, but sure ‚Äúhonor‚Äù).  

But I love tossing pizza and working behind the counter at weed shops.  And I‚Äôve worked demo and farm-handing and building barbwire fence, not because of more money but because it was for a Flood Recovery Crew after some mega floods in Colorado.

I promise you, there are people out there who enjoy everything there is to do.  And there are people who will do hard work because it is a necessity to help the community.

It‚Äôs not that ‚Äúeveryone gets paid the same,‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúwe all equally enjoy the full benefits of modern society.‚Äù

Also, Communism is Stateless.  There wouldn‚Äôt be a government to give everyone the same amount of money.   

If that is your position, then you definitely have no idea what Communism is about and wants to do.

Fair enough. But unlike you, I don't mind paying a bit extra taxes to help those in need. There is nothing wrong with wanting to pocket everything for yourselves just like Purdue, it's your hard earn money and people should be able to keep as much of it to themselves as possible. I'd just prefer helping the students with my tax money than having it go towards these geezers pension funds. Congratulations on paying of your loans. You're a real adult now.

Wheeling TQQQ is usually quite productive. Selling options on levered funds usually works well because there is a slight skew which makes people believe they are getting leverage on leverage.

You can only go negative if you are trading on margin or if you are selling naked options. 

You can buy way out of the money options with low money, you just have to realize you are overwhelmingly likely to be wrong a lot more than you are right. 

Frankly, the best thing to do with low money is buy as much STWD as possible and let that 10% or so dividend be your option fund. Alternatively, XOM is paying out big dividends right now and is also on the recovery bus after spending the summer in the basement. 

Best thing to do is buy shares on every red day at the close and keep doing that.

The end is always near, but that‚Äôs never stopped VIX from falling below 20 before. 

To make something clear about volatility and the transition of power: Vix 40 before the election was probably pricing in the chance of a constitutional crisis. You‚Äôll notice how Charm flows shot the SPY up as VIX went through a half-life in a week. Put call ratios are at their lowest point in a decade, so it‚Äôs not put hedgers keeping VIX so high, so that leaves the record volumes of call buying.

Okay let me give a more specific example. A manager of a local department store absolutely loathes his job, but he does it because he has 3 kids and a wife and he brings home 70k a year to keep them all fed. But if everyone all made the same amount for every job, why would he still be a department store manager, why not a taxi driver or grocery bagger? He takes on the stress and displeasure he gets from his job because in the end he feels the 70k makes it worth it. Now what about industries like sanitation? Hard labor? How can you honestly convince the majority of these people to keep doing difficult jobs when they can get a much easier job for the same pay. The only way a moneyless society could even function is if the government assigned your career path, and that sounds like a terrifying country to live in

Don't buy over inflated calls. Use options pricing calculator to work out fair value based on volatility and time to expiration.

Because of the low volume on these OTM calls WSB has bidded them up beyond their fair value now. Wait for them to come back down if you want in on that play.

I don't think people understand the context of data here. Companies like Facebook or Linkedin are big not because of their software, but because of the network effects they exhibit. And because of those network effects they become larger and larger and are able to collect more data.

Now with autonomous driving, if that technology gets to a point where others can feasibly copy/modify the software, you don't need to stick with TSLA, if Volkswagen will also get you from point A to point B. So it is totally different from FB, because you won't simply use another social networking website if your friends are not there.

Besides there is the price factor in as well. If autonymous driving is too expensive, then will people pay for it? If it is not expensive, then how are you going to achieve these growth..
no, that's with the split.
Yeah but I‚Äôm a retard that‚Äôs what we do here right?

I recommend not doing options and paper trading it first on td ameritrade , thinkorswim.

You're really missing the forest for the trees. Do you think that the millionaires in congress care all that much about making $174,000 a year versus $74,000 a year? That's practically a rounding error compared to what they can make off of trading and lobbying. Take out the actual incentives for money to be in politics and if there's a flood of working and middle class politicians that are only in it for the fat salary we can look into a pay cut.

Thats a temperature issue! Anything cooked too hot on the stove or grill will do the same thing.  Convection just circulates the air so that the heat doesn't radiate from the back to the front. With convection the more efficient heat delivery is making it cook faster. Just turn it down a little (usually 25 degrees for a frozen pizza) and you're golden
Yeah. It‚Äôs the same virus - like COVID. It‚Äôs just new strain - like COVID. Where did I say it takes months worth of R&D to develop a vaccine? Once they have that base, it‚Äôll be much quicker second/third round. But it still makes time - like FLU. 

Yes. You take FLU shots to increase immunity every year - LIKE COVID (and new strains).

They do it to get money..... because they will starve and be homeless otherwise.

The compensation is housing, education, utilities, food, everything. 

Marx, who is kinda the spearhead of this idea, wrote:

> ... in a communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and this makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow ... 


The 1984 thing is where Biden and modern Centrist Liberals take us. State Capitalism with a smiley face.  Bernie will fail because he isn‚Äôt actually a socialist. He‚Äôs a democratic socialist, which is a misnomer. You can‚Äôt win the Commie plays in a Capitalist game.  Trump has always been Mad Max because he just wants to crank capitalism to 11.     Communism leads us to Star Trek.

It is one thing to grow 50% when you are less than 10 billion. Completely different animal when you are at 30 billion. And doing that in a a few years in a row, no company has done that - hence the rationale in using AMZN's growth trajectory. Find me another company that can easily grow 20% with 300b in revenue. Now I am already assuming that for TSLA.

Re: margins, don't forget that TSLA's current margin is not the real margin - it is purely a function of regulatory credits. TSLA's actual margin on cars is around 1-2%, which Musk has admitted. So a long way to go for those margins and growth. But guess what - my projections area incorporate those anyway. And that's again the whole point of the argument - even with those crazy growth/margin scenarios, there is no margin of safety in the stock.

I might be off a day or two, but I remember that weekend.  Also, I didn't pay attention the market at that time because I had a job that involved being on-call 24/7.

Yeah - but NKLA dumped from over $90 to $16. HYLN had a similar path - was trading over $50 now around $20

This is going to follow the same path. LAZR is another one trend the same direction.

This will dump back to the $30s or lower over the next 2 weeks. It‚Äôs how these pump and dumps operate with companies that have zero revenue

I made money on TSLA when the media was saying not to buy it. I  think I made 7X. Just shares. At this point I don't think it's going to do a 7X again to say the least. Maybe 1 or 2 in the next while. And everyone is talking about how it's so great now. I think I may be done. If it goes back to the low 5s I'll buy it again with a portion. Otherwise I'm moving on.

Source: Guessing.
NIO calls come Monday. I can‚Äôt wait to be let down.
Good practice yeah just know that options have more risk I guess. And the number of calls you buy don‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôll make more money. One call is the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. The ‚Äúpremium‚Äù you put would be for each share in the contract. So if the premium is $.50, one call would cost $50 or $.50x100shares. So the maximum amount you can lose with one call is the $50 you paid. But if the price of the premium goes up to $1.00 while you own the call, you can sell it to close for $100-$50= $50 profit. The more contracts you buy, the more money you would make off of the rise in the premium but it also increases the max amount that you can lose.
What about shorting an ETF?

From Tesla themselves: Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment. While these features are designed to become more capable over time, the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.

I also have to do it in my 2017 MS, which Tesla are you driving that doesn‚Äôt require that?
Roger is a solid character and I'll admit in my early twenties I modeled parts of my personality after him.

Bears aren‚Äôt anti American.. they are trying to make some money.  Unfortunately being a bear in the current state of the market is like betting it all on 17 black on the roulette table.  All it takes is for stimulus approved and your position is toast.  A smart bear is waiting on the sidelines, waiting for all the positive catalysts to go away.  It was vaccine, now it‚Äôs stimulus.  After that they can have their reign.

Lol. Banks like BAC also own Merrill so they do own other companies stocks. 

But, yes. Buyback means they can buy their own stock. It means 2 things. 

1.  They feel confident that buying their own stock is a better investment than other options. 

2. By buying that stock, they limit supply, which increases demand for it and causes it to inflate in price in both the short and long term. 

It‚Äôs kind of a big deal.

Most of these people going into politics are already most likely taking a pay cut to do so.

If they offered a 60k salary, you‚Äôre losing that many candidates that may be more qualified.
He turns into a pumpkin
How much times a day do u guys clean ur ears
Maybe you don‚Äôt. 

But people also do AirBNB lol. And I think the stranger fucking in it probability goes up higher in that scenario.
If you decrease their salary, then the only people who could afford to be in Congress would be the ultra rich. A lot of junior congressmen/women already sleep in their offices because they are tight on money. They are required to keep a house in their district and live in DC where housing prices are pretty high. What they are getting paid now probably isn‚Äôt enough.
You‚Äôre doing great, pal.

CRISIS AVERTED

Was preheating the oven on convection mode, and put the frozen pizza in without switching it back to normal. Realized my mistake after about 90 seconds üòÖ
The way this is
I had 25 puts on QS but sold it at loss cos even I felt that was a bit retarded
what does accumulate shares means lol. you buy them one at a time?
I've been a TSLA hodler for a long time. After it spikes it hits some dips for a while. I wouldn't rush in on Monday..
Stimulus is the new rate cut from last year. Bad news is good news as the market wants more stimulus. Bulls should be wanting more temporary lockdowns to guarantee a large stimulus.
Sooooo red Monday confirmed
I remember this sub saying ‚Äú4 MORE YEARS‚Äù when orange was speaking in some event
so if tokenization does take place then am I wrong in thinking that companies dealing in collectables are going to see incredible levels of revaluation (due to significantly boosted liquidity)?

I loved the idea of investing in a space stock, but these guys are full retard.

By the time virgin galactic makes their solid rocket booster, barely the edge of space space plane work, spacex will be flying humans point to point between New York and Shanghai and actually going to outer space. 

SPCE and GME are straightforward calls: shit businesses both. How the hell anyone is bullish on either is beyond me.
Does bank buyback mean they can buyback their own stock or can they buy other compamy's stock as well?
Dude's a maniac
Been divorced before I ‚Äúmade‚Äù it. 

That divorce shit can hit whenever. I would hide that money and when you are 65 if you are still married you can tell her. 

Sometimes knowing she can get half will be incentive to divorce. If she has divorced friends that‚Äôs a red flag

Oh there was definitely some of that going on. But I am assuming she just got out the shower before I got there, because her feet didn‚Äôt have any odor or taste to them. SAD!
Don't tell her. If/when you get a divorce she's going to take half of that money if she knows about it.
I know say that a few more times and then think about how you‚Äôd feel buying intel stock
Lol, mine will happen first!

Sad to hear no foot sniffing.
I can definitely agree I sold everything when it 50.00, I dont understand the hype, nothing will be in production till 2024, that is 3yrs from now. Hopefully they are able to pull it off, I plan to buy back once it cools down.

Have you ever been to Russia? Trump is like a god there, they literally worship him. Why do you think that is? Logically, do you think it's because he's protecting Americans from and russia or is it because he's helping with their agenda?
Lol. As if....
Different question. There has to be a line for a short to cross at any major fund. I see an arbitrary 25% marker representing 185k shares that need to be ‚Äúun-failed‚Äù. So even if Monday am, bosses come in and say you gotta fix those positions, 185k purchases is 10% of an average day. What am I missing?
maybe when everything was done by humans back then. now days, you'd get killed trading straight off patterns
Bank buybacks gonna be HUGE for building momentum even if stim is still being tabled. 

If stim does somehow pass. On like fucking donkey Kong brah
its not, the constant of proportionality could be a big number, they could end up earning more than what they earn now. it just means they only earn more if the people are earning more too, so if they are greedy they should make good economic policies to earn more money

I know this is old but we need an app that randomly generates bad ideas, like you can literally have programmed to choose certain words as the first, second, third words and so on. Or better yet a challenge generator that makes up random things for you to challenge your friends to do and it can record you both going back and forth. Pretty much making a montage of silly or stupid things that people are challenged to do. Then, people can rate them and it will generate something like a high score and the person with the highest score is the beast.

If you're really unsure, look into a stock that is long term gains and buy the stock itself. It's how I started and, if I hadn't fucked up and sold/rebought in Sep, I'd be much higher. But I do have to say that options immediately proved to be the way to go for big gains (but also big losses). 

I wish you luck! Wave to me if you see me at the food bank lol
Lol you bout to lose all your money man
They're the same company. TAK is an ADR (American Depository Receipt), which basically means that a big US investment bank owns shares in Takeda in Japan and listed a financial instrument (the ADR) on an American stock exchange to make it easier for Americans to invest in the company.

Each share of TAK is equivalent to 0.5 shares of Takeda or TKPHF, which is why TAK is half the price.

You want TAK; there's very little buying and selling of TKPHF as everyone uses TAK nowadays, so it'll be MUCH easier to buy and sell TAK.

Ahh bro, glock 22 & 26 are two of my favs. Just not my top bitches. But reliable as fuck. I love the longer trigger pull and no safety. Plus, you can swap the barrels n spring and turn them into 9‚Äôs so it‚Äôs like having a glock 19 too. 

But the 220 trigger when it goes from double action to single action is butter. And the heavier frame gives it less muzzle rise than a polymer glock.

 Edit: 

My first sig was a 2022, it‚Äôs like if a glock 19 fucked a sig and had a baby. And in the same price range as a glock.

30 here, spent most of my teens and 20s in my room, can confirm, people believe I'm way younger than I am.
I did the same but knew I was likely tossing a hundred bucks in the trash. Bought otm Kodak puts after the news broke the SEC found no wrong doing. Once I realized that still didn't mean they were awarded the money I bought a few monthly puts. After two weeks it became clear the news I wanted (that they were not getting the money) wasn't likely. So sold everything for a loss of about $170. Would have been real freaking nice had that news come and the stock go back to $2.70.

Still very cautious with options but I'm very close to putting a couple grand in ITM MT yearly puts. I just don't see steel prices remaining high post covid. Then again lagging economies could push for lots of government spending on infrastructure projects. But I expect the trade wars to wind down and China to go back to pumping out cheap steel again.
This makes me feel better, I started last week after a big post on here that actually got me interested in the idea of reading, downloaded Robin Hood and now I‚Äôm watching some YouTube videos, just made my first call but I‚Äôm only 200 deep in so far. Hoping I can learn something.

Dude these guys here make me feel smart but reading your post made it clear I‚Äôm still at level 2/10 and have a lot to learn. 

The conversation you had about 30 DTE vs 7 DTE SPY puts is what I‚Äôm interested in right now. The 30 DTE puts are too expensive to really pay off but the 7 DTE puts leave you a little exposed, right? Say the black swan event starts the Friday your puts expire and then  gaps down over the weekend. If you weren‚Äôt watching the action Friday and buying more puts that day you are fucked come Monday. 

You might be glued to your screen all day and can manage this but I could get caught with my pants down. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to manage this with some 7 DTE and some 14 DTE puts every week. I need to dig into this.

Do you pay for it? Cause it‚Äôs full of thirst traps promoting their ig
Here's my hot take:

We pay them *extremely* well, and allow them to collect that salary until they day they die. This salary can be a % of the GDP or something so that it will always be an extremely lucrative salary. In exchange for this, they are not allowed to be involved in ANY business of any sort for the rest of their lives. If they are discovered to be involved in anything, stocks, advising, board seat, w/e, they are publicly executed.

ehh idk, like i feel like the conservative viewpoint is just almost entirely wrong on every aspect. i would not want any of their policies implemented. dems suck cock too, theyre literally just center right conservatives in any other country.  expanding medicare out would be going with medicare for all, whereas conservative standpoint is private insurance no government interference at all,  so no compromise. at least thats how i see it

How would others copy Tesla's autonomous driving AI? My understanding it is continuously learning from terrabytes of data. I'm not sure Tesla would just export their model like google's BERT and since it's in constant development, the company that holds the dates holds the edge.
The way I see it is, the value is not the car but the data. Like Facebook or LinkedIn, any decent developer can rebuild the social network, but how do you get their users and data? That's what Tesla has, drivers and their data.

WBA has a big problem with leases.  Instead of financing their stores they do leaseback deals that include the buildout costs.

Do stocks with long term decline/growth generally have huge news before the turnaround? Like would it be blatantly obvious if I just look up news to know when the big shift is going to occur?

Because I've noticed and been trying to play off of long term gain, but short term dip. Another thing I've tried and done well a few times is play off of pharma fails. Huge drop, but about 2 weeks later they start rising some because the company is still valuable.

You're absolutely right---actually you made one minor mistake you're comparing the June 18 QQQJ call to the June 30 QQQ call. The price of the June 18 QQQ call is ~ $5.70 which buttresses your point even more. 

And you can see this from their IV: QQQJ has an IV of 28% while QQQ has an IV of 21%. So yes, all things being equal, QQQ is cheaper than QQQJ.

All that said, I am still balls deep in QQQJ calls because I believe over the next year, it will outperform QQQ for the reason OP stated: it has many more beaten down companies than QQQ. The big boys in QQQ have all recovered for the most part. Another crucial point is that QQQJ has more non-tech companies so if there is a rotation out of tech, it will suffer less than QQQ.

I'm very bullish about this etf. I saw a WSJ article where someone did a historic backtest from 2016 or 2017 and QQQJ outperformed QQQ even with the insane run of the big boys MSFT, AAPL, NVDA & ADBE during that period.

Rule of thumb, never assume no one reads your tax returns, even if you lose money. All it takes is one perky auditor and you're fucked. I've disclosed for every brokerage account I've applied for. 

I've grown up seeing how shitty other friends/family getting audited was and I never ever want to deal with that, if you're super rich and can pay other people to deal with it sure, but at that level money isn't probably that much of a problem.

No job forces you to do anything. No job requirement states you must acquire housing. That's how they do it. Sure but that doesn't mean you can't buy a mansion or a hotel or any other way to house a bunch of people for small periods. 
No I expect the opposite. They will squeeze every poor person for as much as they can get. 

I'm ok with that. The idea that you you need a high salary in order to be competitive is a fallacy. It's invented by people who refuse to work without a good salary. The concept that many people manage to do great in B's with low wages or free prices that to be wrong. The scum of the earth converging on politics while also being incompetent shows this to be widely untrue. Lots of highly paid individuals fucking us over poorly.

Cost of living is dictated by supply and demand of housing. Many cities with a high cost of living are like that because of policy decisions, such as rent control. Having a high cost of living doesn't mean your area is necessary thriving. A better indicator is cost of living vs pay index.

Reasoning by analogy sucks. Tesla has already proven they can grow revenue twice as fast as Amazon at a 5 year CAGR of 50%. They are going to post an ~8% industry leading EBIT margin during a pandemic year, and Tesla is still at the an early stage of explosive growth and margin expansion due to operating leverage. 

By my forecasts, I think Tesla can return 15% per year for the next 5 years if they can accomplish their ambitious targets of 50% Revenue CAGR and mid teens EBIT margins. This does not take into account their robotaxi ambition, nor does it take into account the potential for the EV market to grow much faster if governments pull more policy levers to drive EV adoption in the face of stubbornly rising emissions from transportation.
I sold my common stock and bought tech leaps the first half of September,  while the market sold off.  Still havent recovered. Leaps get you sleeps but you may have to sleep for awhile.

You want me to say this for a third time? Okay.


Barring politicians from trading during their career is the same thing as barring them from owning stock because, in effect, you create a major financial disincentive to own stock going into office.^1   

Therefore, you create a situation where the only people who are joining the rank of potlician: a) sell their stock immediately^2 b) never owned stock in the first place c) can‚Äôt grasp the negative effects of not owning stock during their 2-40 year tenure as a politician^3


^1)stonks are risky. There may be some subreddits around that even demonstrate this risk!  No one, not even the most conservative portfolio managers, would agree to buy a stock if they knew they were going to take the job of politicians and therefore wouldn‚Äôt be  allowed to sell it.

^2) this becomes the most likely scenario. Politicians remain majority middle class or wealthier, and if one was so inclined to join the ranks of politician they, just like all rational humans would in a similar situation, sell any stock they owned beforehand rather than risk a downturn and they not be able to sell.

^3 liquidity is a very basic, 101 finance level, concept. It is built in, in fact, to the price of almost all securities‚Äîpublicly traded or not. The kind of people that see no problem with giving up ALL liquidity for anywhere from 2-40 years ( the life of their political career) would be stupid.


That‚Äôs about all I got for you. Please just refer to you wife‚Äôs boyfriend if you need further help.

The job literally forces them to have multiple homes. You need a home in your state and a home in DC. You think the poor are going to stop getting fucked over because of a pay cut to politicians that leave the ultra-wealthy (that make up most of our government at the national level) completely unaffected?

Regardless of your feelings of politicians needing to be solely driven by passion, there are plenty of people in the working and middle class that do good work while also being motivated by their salary. You'd be needlessly choking the talent pool from non-wealthy people all because of some idea that a competitive wage completely prevents someone from doing a good job.

I genuinely would not be surprised if Trump starts going on a Twitter rampage, along the lines...

"The election has been stolen. I am not leaving. I am your president. We will restore the presidency. MAGA country stand up. Fight for Trump."

If you think this is overly pessimistic, check out his latest tweet pinned as a video with the chant "Fight for Trump." Subliminal messages galore

Yeah I learned a lot since the release of the 3080 and ps5 lol. End of the day its extra revenue for GME. Worst case scalpers pay that fee to resell at less profit for themselves. Also would have to limit amount per member and because it would be membership based easier to control and track placed orders. It would require having an actual account with the company.

Edit: To address your first point depends how they implement it as I do agree many would try and exploit any sort of system like this.

Apologies for typos in my earlier message. Sure, on a relative basis TSLA's valuation does not seem that off but I am not even touching Snowflakes, Doordashs of the world, which are absurd to me by any means that they don't even warrant opening a topic. 
TSLA at least is more interesting to discuss and try to forecast.
It's not all about immediate profits though, sometimes you have to make a little bit less money now to potentially make more in the future.

Scalping problems associated with the new GPUs, CPUs and gaming consoles are primarily linked to e-commerce not being robust and fool-proof enough to deal with the opportunists gobbling up the entire supply, while demand is higher than ever before, due to people being stuck at homes.  


For example, there's this local tech store here where I live (EU). They don't have the best prices, in fact, they're kinda expensive, but they provide the best customers experience by far, online and in-store. For those reasons, most people actually buy PC hardware and accessories from them, and they make the most money in this sector, locally.

I have no idea but I do not think the parabolic increase will continue much longer at all. I am personally waiting for any meaningful pullback of some sort and then entering leaps Jan 2022 leaps for SPY targeting 400.  Probably some XLV leaps as well at the same time.  Until it corrects or pulls back though, 1/15 370/360 put spreads.

See, that's where I'm lost for the leap calls. It seems the companies that start to get hyped almost immediately have expensive longer calls. I'll look into DG and see what I can get. Currently I have a couple shorter calls on AMD because I'm thinking triple digits by New Years.

How do you go about trying to find the cheaper options that actually look good? You use fundamentals or something or follow the autists and see what tickers pop up?

Anything online is exploitable. I've seen EVGA do online waitlists for Nvidia's RTX 3000 series graphics cards. That kinda sorta worked, but EVGA is only one manufacturer out of a dozen others. GME can act as a hub where console and PC component manufacturers can send their supplies, knowing that those supplies won't end up in the hands of scalpers. It wouldn't give them a unique advantage, there's Microcenter and other retailers already established in that space, but sometimes just doing what others have already proven to be profitable can make you money as well.

People are willing to wait in line a little bit for a guarantee to buy at a retail price. I don't think there's anything but the concern about pandemic, maybe, stopping GME from doing things that way in the next 3-6 months. But, one solid PR campaign and you're set to go.

That's because intel 10nm has roughly the same density as TSMC 7nm. Those measurements mean absolutely nothing as it varies between manufacturers. With their 5000 series AMD has a achieved a massive jump in IPC, a large boost to core clocks, and maintained the same power usage as their 3000 series. By the time intel puts out true 10nm chips (this upcoming generation is 10nm architecture backported to 14nm) AMD will be on 5nm or possibly 3nm keeping them solidly in the lead. If they continue to achieve above average IPC increases and low power consumption on upcoming generations intel is pretty much fucked.

I mean Medicare for all could be a compromise. Like you could expand Medicare to children and young adults. Or have a Medicare buy in option. You could allow people to buy medication from foreign countries. Healthcare is something you could compromise on. You could also go the other way and cut Medicare. Abortion is a bit of a binary issue but most issues are not.

I think salary-wise it‚Äôs fine for them to be making a bit above $100,000. They‚Äôre leading the community. Of course they should be properly compensated for it. Most of the money they actually get is from shady deals or outside of office.

The fact is that the job puts them in positions of power. Give them too little and you‚Äôll just get rats wit no morals who try to abuse the system to get paid either way.

Leave the salary as it is and create more limits on how they can generate other forms of income while in office. That way they can still earn a comfortable wage and we have measures to try and keep the bad ones accountable.

Their benefits should also reflect what the majority of Americans can get access to.

You can never go wrong with amd or tesla. Cult followings will always win. But leap calls on those two companies are expensive af. Like its not even funny. 

For amd the cheapest option 2 years out is almost 3k. Thats why I suggested dollar general. Gotta know where to look to find the cheap options. If I had the money I'd definitely pick tesla or amd but I just can't afford risking 3k all on 1 call.
Amazon putting them out of business
On Monday the S&p 500 will reflect the tsla price. The price it was included at was the closing price on Friday. So all the big institutional buys happened in the last 10 minutes of the day so they bought at the closing price via a huge ass special auction. If you look at the chart you‚Äôll see the spike at 10 minutes before the close.

We are totally right on Tesla.  It's just a matter of when.  And that becomes a game of market timing.  When will the market get a clue and start dumping on Tesla.  Very difficult to figure out.  If Tesla goes up more on Monday I might buy some puts.  I almost did on Friday, but that wacky action at the end of the day reminded me of how much delusion is powering this stock.  I think a record amount of money traded in Tesla stock Friday.
Because the miracle cure that we all banked our hopes on might not be effective anymore. Kinda a big deal.

If someone were able to garner enough public support and run a successful enough campaign to win an election to hold a low-income office, they could absolutely be making more money in the private sector doing similar work. 

This is like suggesting that researchers in academia would be more susceptible to bribes than those in the private sector, despite the fact that the former *chose* to be in a position of lower income, indicating that they are less likely to be motivated by money.

I‚Äôm a 4th type then. I want to learn. It was kinda country where I grew up. People just want to get by and don‚Äôt really teach let money make money. My grandpa was an exception only because he worked hard his whole life, then worked hard to buy trailers and put them on land he owned, and worked hard dealing with the renters to get the monthly rent, and worked hard to take care of the trailers falling apart. It was supplemental income but he was old and still had to work hard and deal with a lot of stress. The idea of making money with money is something I strive to learn. I learned how to buy stocks and watch them slowly grow over time. This sub has showed me, with more risk involved, there can be more rewards (and more losses). A sphere of influence is a powerful thing. If I allow myself just to sit and be complacent like the vast majority of people who live around me, then I would never strive for more. Yet if I drive 7 miles west, it is a different world full of affluent individuals. Are those people going to be willing to share with me their positions, strategy, or even give me the time of day, no. So I‚Äôm thankful to be a part of this sub

Gamma is the reason why lesser time to expiry contracts are riskier. As time passes, gamma increases, reaching it‚Äôs maximum of 1 when ATM. At 2PM, gamma will be huge since expiry is only 2 hours away. They‚Äôll be worth very little but if the stock begins to make a big move in  a favorable direction, gamma starts to pick up and contract prices explode. 
The opposite can happen too. If you put money into 0DTE contracts, be aware you can lose 50%+ in literally 1 second if prices move against you hard enough.

I‚Äôve noticed the same thing. I started with $1,000 and now have $35,000. Nothing big like some people but it‚Äôs easy to risk it when I've never actually had the money in my bank account.
Seriously, if you are really in an OpSec roll, I feel bad for whoever employs you. If your company was using Solarwinds, what are you doing to to find out how many backdoors have been injected into your systems right now? No OpSec I know would allow a team to continue to use a product who had builds of their software comprised. I can't even imagine the dumpster fire that is burning at my last employer at the moment. They're going to be scanning the shit out of everything and not be satisfied until every bit has been evaluated.
Unfortunately, if you make being a politician expensive, you only get the people who can afford it.

Also, this is the mother of false equivalencies. Plane tickets for the entire Congress would not come closer to scratching the surface of the two programs you mention.
Problem is I don't know what the fuck I'm doing right. A majority of the money I made was on TSLA and VALE. I recently started trading options about 2 months ago. And from the research I've done, QQQJ seems to be the Mecca of economic recovery ETFs. Seems to have a ton of upside potential for the next stimulus Bill, and now with vaccines in play, if we start returning to a normal economy and not the speculatory economy we've seen for the last 6 months, I think QQQJ has massive upside potential. If we close everything down again though it's beyond fucked

What‚Äôs the longest break you took from stock?
Yup one of the best shows
This 12 to 1 short/float ratio is bullshit. Here's why:
Short interest before VW short squeeze was around 12%, Porsche had 74.1% (42.6% stocks and 31.5% cash-settled stock options), Lower Saxony had 20%, so the float was around 6%. 
THAT MAKES SHORT/FLOAT RATIO 2, NOT FUCKING 12.

The stock went up 500% and it could've possibly gone EVEN HIGHER but Porsche decided to sell 5% of VW's stock so shorts could cover.

And the argument about many smaller holders is even bigger bullshit. The VW shorters were big hedge funds that lost $30 BILLION DOLLARS because of the short squeeze.

This comment kinda seems like Melvin or another big shorter spreading misinformation to shake our conviction.

Rural dwelling F-450 owner checking in here. What I need in a truck is low end torque. If the EV can match the towing capacity of the ICE version, I'm all in. Let's be real. I know some folks in my neck of the woods love to glorify petrol, and relish the sound of their tuner exhausts, but at the end of the day, diesel fuel smells like shit and the engine noise just drowns out the  thumping sound system. I suspect truck owners may be more motor agnostic than we expect.
Watch the Georgia Senate race in early January. If dems sweep and take control of congress then the EV and all green energy companies will start printing for us. If democrats lose and republicans hold control then there is no chance for any of this to come to fruition.

Since politicians won‚Äôt ever vote for a bill that won‚Äôt allow them to trade stocks, what if we just take away their salary? How many senators and congressman have their government salary as their only source of income? It would be interesting to see their net worth vs their govt. salary. Or if their net worth is below a certain amount, then they can apply for the government salary.

Little tip for you. Take 1k of that 3k and buy a call option 2 years out for dollar general. They are cheap as fuck and the company is on a steady ass climb up and becoming more and more mainstream. 

Blow the rest of riskier shit. No one talks about it here but there's a very clear pattern. Almost all these crazy money post you see are from extremely far out leap calls. You will lose doing weeklies. Calls 3-6 months out are decent.

They bought tinder and focused on building better premium features into dating apps + ok Cupid was always like a MySpace ‚Äî people with a bio and interests the length of a life story. also a mostly free model and therefore a market for broke folks and dumb creepers. 

I think it doesn‚Äôt really matter in smaller markets; for instance there are places where bumble is the local fav and others where OK Cupid has greater appeal. From a brand perspective OKC will never survive long term and I don‚Äôt think niche dating sites ie farmers only will either since the better marketed dating apps have good search filters.

The deal is I'm finishing school and getting shit ready for life changing shit. The 3k is secondary, but I'm trying to use it to establish a side income.

She didn't trade at all between being sworn in and the Fauci meeting. It's pretty obvious she got the news that it's a pandemic, told her husband to dump, and then he told his firm to dump and buy telestocks, and it sucks because it was all done via word of mouth so there's no paper trail to tie them to it.

Don't, Solarwinds is antiquated and a pile of shit, and that was before this huge hack that may have backdoored tons of companies.

If they haven't already migrated out, this will be the last straw or the kick in the ass to actually dump this shitty company.

Tip: dating apps use an Elo rating system, similar to the hidden rankings you get on competitive videogames (why it's easier to rank higher in games when you make a new account. And tinder, actually.). So you have a tinder rank based on whether high or low rank people match with you. If you match with a 10 your rank goes up, if you match with a potato your rank goes down. Here's the rub: they mostly show you to people with similar Elo rankings. So the standard dude practice of blindly swiping right only hurts your chances to even be shown to attractive people because every...less-than-attractive...person you match with brings your Elo down. What does this mean for you and your johnson? First if you've been blind-swiping for a while, make another account (alternatively, "boosting" shows you to everybody and you can use this to reset if you do it enough). Second if you only swipe right on people you're legitimately attracted to, eventually you will be mostly shown to the people you find legitimately attractive and consequently get better matches.

My 2 cents:

I think long term fuel cells will be best at quickly storing excess renewable generation for a time it can be used weeks or months later.  These are short duration events and therefore needs low CAPEX and rapid cycling capability - PEM.  FCEL tech is designed to be baseloaded, always on.  For that H2 turbines will be way better and cheaper.

Short term i have no idea what startups could pop.  Long term i like material suppliers (JM, DD) and existing small generator suppliers with fuel cell offerings - Cummings.  I also like Pt prices to go up if fuel cells pop off.  I'm looking for H2 compressor and storage plays.  I think that will be a real game-changer.

they do.. you aren't paying attention. 99% is retarded, 1% is genius. you have to WORK to find the 1%, and then 99% of that is wrong. put in more work. 

Example, fucking RIOT Leaps. hugely misvalued. 

Tesla calls for S&P inclusion mismanagement (you had to get into these at least 1 month ago) were hugely misvalued. 

People talked about Palantir BEFORE THE FUCKING IPO, and you could have jumped in and profited off the run. 

Value was on here like 2-3 months ago on tsla battery day.

AMD has so many things going for it definitely would be surprised if it doesn‚Äôt double with in 2 years. From a pure architecture stand point there cpus can scale quantity wise very well, basically intel needs a pretty massive architecture change to match that. What does that mean? They are going to be eating intels server market share for at least a couple years. Intel may be able to increase the per core performance but that value is going down now that more software is finally leveraging multiple cores (there will always be a place for single core performance but that benefit needs to be weighed against the downside of core count). Amd also finally have a gpu product that can also compete with there main competitors in the space nvidia, I would look forward to what they can bring on there next gen to see where they go. They also recently made a deal to acquire a company that adds complementary technology to there‚Äôs which supposedly will allow them to access different markets (not 100% sure this will be great, but I thing there ceo earned benefit of the doubt if you look at where there stock was a few years ago). They got consistent revenue from making basically all the current and last gen gaming consoles minus the switch. They recently raised prices on there products to make more per there cpu unit solid and r probably ganna show some crazy you revenue growth again next year.

Honestly the only question is how red it will be. There‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs going to close above 695 on Monday. There‚Äôs gonna be a ton of profit taking at the open. It was at 675 in AH trading. I won‚Äôt be surprised to see it fall as low as 620 tomorrow. 

Will it be a green week? Probably not but that‚Äôs harder to predict given how much stock has just been removed from the float.

I have only generic advice: start learning, open a paper trading (ie fake money) account to practice your ideas and see how successful you'd be, learn what technical analysis means, learn all the mechanics of the market... Then put all your money in s&p etfs or index funds bc most professional investors can't keep up with them anyway in the long run.

I concur, I live across the street from a Walgreens and walk 3 blocks to a Target. Walgreens charges more for everything, is depressing and antiquated, never has any staff to help, and has a single person running a register with a stained shirt ringing people out. Target(mini) on the other hand has a better selection, prices, and has 3 or 4 people at the registers and 6 self checkouts running and almost always has a queue. Walgreens is for old people who still coupon cut. If they didn't have a pharmacy, they would already have gone bust.

Name one person you know that doesn't have a Prime membership. My wife, god bless her soul, was looking for a specific vitamin that she used to get from Walgreens.

It had not even occurred to her that you can buy things online that don't come from Amazon. WBA might get a COVID bump but this thing is going the way of the dodo.

Acknowledge that you fucked up by hiding (or "not hiding per se") the initial money. She'll be upset that you lied to her and hid things from her, and it's better to get in front of that by admitting you fucked up and you're sorry. That's what I'd lead with, and get her to completely understand the "lying" (per se) first. Then explain the investing, the results of that, and how much money you have.

Be ready for her to be a bit paranoid about other things for a while, maybe forever ("If he hid this for so long, what else has he been hiding?"). You'll have to be a completely open book about all aspects of your life going forward, and even then there's no guarantee she'll be cool.

It'll probably work out fine, especially since you've been together for so long. I hope it does for you, dude. Good luck.

> On January 24, just three weeks into her Senate career, Loeffler attended a private Senate briefing by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control, about the coronavirus threat. Afterward, Loeffler continued to publicly downplay the risk from the virus and its economic impact. But in the three weeks following the meeting, Loeffler and Sprecher made more than 20 stock sales amounting to between $1.25 million and $3.1 million. Loeffler also bought stock in two companies that produce teleworking software.

As long as you keep it a long-term spec play it wont matter if you get in right now. I'd compare it's valuation to Draft Kings and see where that puts it, margins are also a lot better so arguably it could trade even more richly than Draft Kings. Really, it just depends on if the market wants to hype it up so I don't think you've missed the run so to speak. Skillz has created a new market essentially so it really depends on if people understand this fact.

Amazon entered the pharmacy business two years ago, with its purchase of PillPack. Their free shipping to prime members and discount cards adds nothing that is not available from CVS and Walgreens. Also online prescription orders only make up about only 20%. Amzn is just trying to add value to Prime. But let's be honest people subscribed to prime for other reasons than medicines. Amzn doesn't offer what WBA does which is real life medical professionals at hundreds of healthcare outposts across the country.

Because there was a sharp move up before this pattern began. Stock moves up sharply, then spends time cooling off and consolidating before moving higher. The prevailing momentum is up. PLTR has been given every opportunity to move lower with all the bearish analyst reports and it hasn't been able to.

Bears are out on full force peddling doom and gloom forgetting that covid, lockdowns and stimulus don‚Äôt matter to the market at all. As long as we have stimulus talks to go well news and vaccine pumps we will keep mooning.

I said 3 weeks ago we aren‚Äôt going to break 360 any time soon and I stand by that
But you could do that with a more realistic strike as well...

Thanks brotha!

I appreciate that feedback. I even thought about making an acronym spreadsheet before my post so I'm glad you mentioned this. I'll do just that and edit the post!

Best of luck to you in 2021 as well :)

I dunno, my dudes.   Walgreens has been a considerable downslope since 2015.

This ‚Äúall time low‚Äù is double their all time drop in 2006 to about $20.   $45-35 seems to be a fairly level standard for WBA over the long haul.  It‚Äôs largest bubble started in 2012 and seems to be dying back to this dying 35ish level..

Are covid vaccines really going to boost their stock..  since they‚Äôll probably be free... right?  And the app will also be free, yeah?

I‚Äôm not buying overpriced snacks and drinks and odd frozen dinners when I get my vaccine.  Imma be in and fucking out.  Walgreens is for crack heads and senile old Karens.

Someone please prove me wrong before Monday so I know what to do.

Yeah but there was no way to know. They could have very well expired worthless. That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt say for certain. After the fact when you KNOW they wouldn‚Äôt, yeah you‚Äôre going to say you missed one. But if it had tanked, you wouldn‚Äôt say that. Literally, no one knew what was going to happen. Did you see anyone anywhere saying for certain it would rip? No. We all wanted it to. But there was no way to know. Your hindsight post is literally applied to anything.

Yeah I avoided puts after reading about the partnership with that one retailer in Canada. If it can swing those kinds of deals here I don‚Äôt see the price dropping much. Not cause they‚Äôre worth there valuation tho
On thursday those calls went up 400% bought those end of day to see it go up 100% on Friday but didn‚Äôt sell. We‚Äôll see Monday I guess.

Nah I doubled my $500 at open but continued to hold
yes! many people say it should be proportional to the minimum wage but that doesnt mean anything and its an incentive to raise it irresponsibly. the mean or the median (or a combination of them) is a real measure and reunites actual progress to increase it. much better option imo
Just like last week we will open red and people  will rush in to buy the dip. Every bear who bought puts at open will lose $$...
Anyone actually hoping for a crash so you can go all in on LEAPs. If you did that in March, you‚Äôd of made a fortune.
Shorts could cover in a day but it would take hours at least
You could have seen there was a massive imbalance to the buy side of 68M shares. What I‚Äôm talking about is taking advantage of misprinted options moment before close with a buy side imbalance that large. Nothing to do with hindsight.
This is why I hate politicians. So fucking disingenuous, introducing shit they know will never fly, just to score brownie points with the ignorant masses

Lol yeah I dunno what will happen in Monday. Truly an enigma. I still have calls for next Friday. I couldn't really close them close of Friday since the price jump happened so fast and the option pricing didn't really update. We'll see what happens.

They created a competitive mobile gaming platform that allows mobile game developers to monetize their games without it being pay to win or clogging it up with intrusive adds. Players also get to wager money on 1 vs 1 games that Skillz and the developers both get a cut of. So it's a triple win for developers, players, and Skillz. Also, it is not considered "gambling" in most states because the outcome is no dictated by chance, but rather by skill of the player so it's pretty much available to everyone with a mobile phone. Also, explosive growth rates, 94% gross margins because Skillz only provides the platform (Very lean operation) so developers pay development costs, and two-year lockup period gave me huge confidence that it's a worthy long-term bet.

If you can be King of the Castle at home you dont act out at work. Feminism while being great for women is not so great for institutions like factories which developed when the man was the breadwinner. Since no one wants to go back to women staying at home (for one with modern appliances there is not enough to do at home to justify it as a full time role), we may have to adapt to let men have a  third place besides work and home to let off steam so that when they come to work they focus on work. A shorter work week with time for sports might work.

Will TSLA drag down the whole market?
Why not? Depending on a persons location, you could retire off of half that if you were using that money right. 100k can net you 8k a month selling calls/puts. And there's plenty of places, especially in the south, where that is plenty of money to live off of.
I‚Äôd missed your post so I‚Äôm glad you mentioned it here. I myself get most of my gains from credit spreads (bullish or bearish depending on the situation, but always credit), but same idea, selling premium and the knowledge that theta gang always wins. 

Since you said in your original post you welcome constructive criticism, I will say that I think your post would have gained more traction with folks if you defined all your acronyms on their first use. There were a bunch of acronyms and even I didn‚Äôt know some of them. 

Anyway, congrats on your gains and here‚Äôs to another healthy year in 2021 being card carrying members of theta gang. :)

Yes it does. Because if you have enough money to buy 100 shares. You could have bought more than one option and repeatedly exercised each one by one. Selling the shares back to the market for $20 more then exercise the next one. Over and over. Netting you  a 2k profit for $100 on each one.

It'll never get passed.

In theory, such a bill should say that lawmakers, before the start of their term, must sell all their positions and if they want to stay in the market they must only invest into publicly available no-barrier index funds.

If they want to buy or sell funds, they must publicly declare the dollar amount one month in advance, and one month later that amount will be invested or divested over a three month period (in monthly segments) into ONLY that index fund, and cannot be stopped or reversed for any reason.

No new buys/sells can be declared until that 1 month + 3 month action is completed.

Enjoyed the read. 

I would say though that tesla is more of an R&D company. The value comes more from innovation i would say than the product. I think alot of people would say that if tesla reaches the 6% profit margin toyota has, they would pivot to whatever project that they think needs solving and develop new technologies to meet that goal that they have. Car companies like toyota,mb,bmw havent really tried to innovate and fell back on their branding and trying to get the bottom line. Thats good and all but at the end of the day they are not innovating at all. There is no pivot for them, its just limited to branding and improving their supply chain. None of these companies are even close to what tesla has done w their electric car when it has been a thing for like 6 years. They are lagging behind and even after that they really have no pivot, theyre going to be in the same position in 20 years.
If if dips average down - their January events are guaranteed to jack the price up. People don‚Äôt understand this company and they will basically be explaining how it works to people coming up.

Anyway, that doesn‚Äôt sound too well, but - I see that a ridiculously small percentage of FCEL‚Äôs market cap is short, short interest going down (I don‚Äôt see 12/15 data yet) and most shorts drowning right now. If this company is such a shit show, why isn‚Äôt it shorted way more heavily? This, among other signals I read from the post-dillution recovery tells me that market is still very much net long on FCEL, despite what I keep reading about how its technology is crap and they‚Äôre basically drowning. Losing talent sucks and we can see from INTC example what happens when engineers stop running a tech company, so these rumours do concern me.

Bruh...you killin me. You‚Äôre pulling like 30% out to stash in a depreciating asset? I mean if you must buy a car, at least finance it so you can maintain liquidity and keep stacking in the mean time. Look at the percentage you made on your money this year and look at the APR for a loan. I guarantee you the loan APR is almost negligible in comparison.

Paying cash = money in the trash. Honestly I would see if they would take it back...nobody knows yet and most dealerships give you 2-3 days at least to bring it back no questions asked. If you absolutely must buy a car, at least use bank money to do it so you don‚Äôt have to gash your portfolio...

I like airbnb because you can find some really nice places at good price compared to hotels. You will often find they have amenities hotels can't offer, such as being on a lake or a nice cabin in the woods with a fire pit. You can also find rentals with lots of bedrooms, which could be good for large parties. But i get it I've gotten some undesirable airbnbs which were pretty awful. However airbnb refunded us and delisted that rental from their site.

Yeah I'm not owning any property any time soon.

However the options are cheaper because its pretty low profile and since its following stuff to be included in the nasdaq tech usually is pretty volatile. Its not a bad move just use proper risk managment. like if you lose all your money and itll suck but you wont ruin your life then do it. but dont remortgage your house or some shit if you arent 100%. If a stranger on the internet got you having second thoughts it could be a sign. but also dont @ me if this shit goes to $100 and you miss out.

You have good points. However, we also have to look at the market as a whole. A lot of growth companies at the moment are richly valued - just take a look at the recent IPO‚Äôs. With more liquidity in the market, P/E ratios tend to be on the extreme. Given TSLA‚Äôs growth projectory, we can see why it is valued the way it is in current market conditions. Now, when the feds decides to tighten QE, we should see a considerable correction for TSLA, and the market as a whole. I would not be surprised if that will be the case and we see TSLA trading sideways for the next decade (like it did in the past).

Because the Salesforce platform and ecosystem is not at all a one trick pony, that's just factually wrong. There is a reason it dominates in market share.

Salesforce has better UI, better out of box config, better developer support, more complete dev tools, stronger architecture, it's the better platform for broader customization and integration, including IoT, its ecosystem of apps is vastly larger.

It started out as 'just' a crm suite, but only people who don't actually know the product make the argument that it's all it is anymore. It is a broad and powerful platform. 

The biggest and possible sole advantage Dynamics has over SFDC is price. That's it, msft is trying to undercut to break in.

The call options are cheaper for weeklys. However you have less time for the stock price to rise. Giving you a very narrow window to for your call to be ITM but it doesn't have to be itm to make a profit . Let's say you want to buy a call longer than a year at a strike price of $80 for NIO. If NIO goes up to $70  next week you can sell that call for a good profit even though it's not ITM because it has a lot of time before it expires.

Since they make some of the most important decisions in the country they should be paid very well so we can attract the most qualified people.

A company that pays their executives 60k a year will certainly go out of business.

We should treat our politicians well and fire them when they do a poor job. Just like successful companies do with executives.

Sure thing. Austin actually has a super strong lake culture and lots of people go boating. And because of the weather the boating season is like 9 months long, so that might help at least a little with the ocean thing.  

Austin also is only 3.5 hours away from the ocean via Houston and the Gulf of Mexico. It‚Äôs definitely not as nice as Florida or CA beaches, but hey it‚Äôs a beach!

Yep. May just be greed. He's also the type of guy who would put his worth in to altcoins and sees no reason to sell because they keep going up. Only to lose his entire net worth when they dump and he goes from $1mil back to where he started and wagecuck all over again, rather than locking in gains and guaranteeing free diversified gains for life.

Once not too long ago I wanted to find out how much was available on the borrow on SHOP.  I didn't want to wait 2 hours on the phone on a busy Friday trading day to talk to a broker, so I did the next best thing and just started shorting until my orders got rejected, and then just started closing to right size the position.

I was paying less attention than I should have been and ended up with an $1.8m short position on SHOP that was meant to be in the neighborhood of $200,000.  And worse, it was late Friday before I discovered it, so I had that open over a weekend.  Thankfully, I managed to get out with about $24K in profit on the following Monday.

Not exactly a relaxing weekend, and not the recommended way of finding how much borrow exists.

Maybe he wants to yolo because he doesn't value that money but I think most people would prefer to dump 90% of that TSLA at the high, buy S&P500 with the rest and retire right then.
You can be making 500k a year and still not be able to afford losing money.... Plenty of people live above there means.  More money you make the more expensive shit you can buy.  Shit adds up when your paying people to clean your house do your laundry drive you around and all that good shit.

markets are not rational just follow the trend
Happened with Tesla, has happened with a couple other stocks I've seen recently. If you consolidate at a price level, the mood on the stock is generally bullish, and there are no new negative catalysts, you can only go up. This is the market deciding that $26 is the fair price for PLTR right now. Any more good news or a couple of whale buys and it'll go up big, otherwise it should start trending upward just because.

i thought of compromising as a good alternative to what we have now. but if you actually think of it, compromising on key issues is moot. if you believe abortion is right or wrong, you shouldnt  compromise, you either think babies  are being killed, or bodily autonomy is being restricted, you wouldnt compromise on killing children or giving up your bodily rights. for some smaller issues its not a big  deal, but if you think medicare for all is a necessity and right that should be granted to everyone, i hope you wouldnt compromise and get some half-assed measure. it should be all or nothing and make whoever votes against it to be the bad guy and shit on them, cause they are.

In terms of salary, congress has to maintain two residences: 1 in DC and 1 back home. If you reduce their pay it'll ensure that only the wealthy can comfortably live while in congress. 

Cutting their pay won't lead to any practical outcomes.

Intel has yet to jump to 10nm on desktop but once it does, I believe AMD's lead in performance will dwindle, and with it future prospects of enterprise adoption. It all comes down to when it happens as AMD won't go below 7nm for quite some time while Intel is getting closer to 7nm.
Definitely true. Gen Z is going to be fucked expect the rare few that bought calls on clean energy related stonks.
One short-term factor that may be wind in GameStop's sails is this new scalping phenomena. The general shortage of new-gen graphics cards, processors and consoles is largely due to vultures/scalpers buying up huge volumes of these things online, and then reselling them for 50%, 100% higher prices on Ebay, Craigslist and other places.  


I recently built my own PC and I have been made aware of that phenomena just by hunting for best deals I can in my local area. I am not even from US - here in EU, we're paying 30-50% more for the exact same hardware compared to US.  


GME is uniquely positioned to combat that, because they can  limit the sale of consoles to their brick & mortar shops, preventing scalpers from buying up dozens, hundreds of consoles at once online. Sure, some scalping may still happen, but a scalper wouldn't physically be able to hit 100 shops in a day like he/she is able to when shopping online.  


This is just a guess on my part, but it's a very real possibility. In fact, if I was GameStop management, I'd move aggressively to provide this kind of solution not just for consoles, but for graphics cards, processors and all computer hardware that's affected by scalpers in general.
‚ÄúThey said the first one is free so I will go all in‚Äù
No, it‚Äôs gonna go to 120$ soon
Problem with that is rich politicians could basically bully less wealthy politicians into policy by letting shutdowns wear down the oppositions money. Same reason I‚Äôm okay with them making more than enough money. If the job doesn‚Äôt pay well, it‚Äôs even harder for non millionaires to hold office. 

I personally think a possible change to their pay could be to tie their pay to, say the median or average income. Be it double or what have you. Make our success mean their pay goes up and we might see shit get done. 

And of course yeah bribed/lobbying needs to go absolutely
I agree

Well the 300 is from where i got assigned on puts. I been selling 30 to 34 strike calls 30 or so days out when pltr hits 27. Typically around 1.5 to 3. Buy them back on these dips under 26 for 50% gain. 

So next time its 26.5 27 ill sell a 32 call or something. If it keeps running another further dte. 

Sell puts 20p 30 dte on monday also. Never clump options you are short on the same dte on these higher iv stocks.

I‚Äôve lived in Austin for 20 years. Actually finally decided to get out and I‚Äôm moving to Denver in a few months. 

Austin is a truly magical city, and it definitely has a vibrant feel to its tech scene. SXSW is just filled with energy from young tech entrepreneurs. The city is also gorgeous. The views some of my friends have from their apartments on Rainey Street are almost unbelievable. It‚Äôs jaw dropping. 

With that said, the city just isn‚Äôt for me. I really love four seasons and mountains. I love the cold and hate the heat. This was our second year in a row where we were still getting 100 degree days in mid October, and I‚Äôd just had enough. But that‚Äôs just me. If you have no problem with the heat, you could really love the place. 

The three biggest drawbacks IMHO are the heat, the traffic, and the real estate costs. Property taxes are insane, and sales taxes are some of the highest in the nation. 

Traffic is uniquely bad because the city doesn‚Äôt have a freeway loop like other large cities. It also doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúbusiness district‚Äù route, the highway just runs right through the middle of the city and it‚Äôs an interstate going from Mexico to Canada. It sees 40,000 18 wheelers per day and that has to merge with local traffic. There will be standstill traffic jams on Sunday afternoons. 

With that said, every city has drawbacks and it‚Äôs still a special city. If I didn‚Äôt love winter and mountains so much I would have stayed in austin for the rest of my life.

Good luck with your decision!

> 174,000 salary makes them not poor the moment they are sworn 

Here's a recent list of 76 congressmen with a net worth over $3 million:

https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/25/richest-members-of-congress-by-net-worth/40290533/

The median net worth for congressmen is $500K.

A couple of years on a decent salary isn't going to put a newly minted representative with debts to pay and expenses to meet anywhere close to "not poor" by Washington standards.
Damn this is legit.

Intel has been struggling with the die shrink for a couple years now but their CPUs are still nearly on par with AMD's newest line for per-core perf. The moment Intel finalizes the die shrink, AMD's CPUs will likely be behind again in both perf and efficiency nm for nm just like the Bulldozer days. But unlike the Bulldozer days, AMD chips are now efficient enough for a wide variety of use cases so it'll stay relevant.

On Friday, United officials confirmed the passenger, who it said died at the hospital, had COVID-19 symptoms but did not confirm he was COVID-19 positive or that that was his cause of death. The airline said in a statement that it has been contacted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the incident, which suggests a positive COVID-19 case. CDC officials have not responded to requests about the case.

MAC 350 shares (avg coat below 11) and 4 01/2022 $15 leaps. I am also selling covered calls above my cost basis for extra yield.

This is solid but requires a bunch of work and watching the stock. You also have to be good at identifying trend reversals or micro clues for which way momentum will go. But you‚Äôre right and you have good attention to detail. Pretty much everything with heavy volume either runs similar chart as SPY or QQQ. For this strategy look for VWAP. Most of the time on an ‚Äúokay‚Äù day, chart will print above VWAP and then stay there the rest of the day since it become support basically
Furthermore, pay rises should scale to the national average wage or median (whatever the Reddit zeitgeist decides) increase is.
i feel like im correct, dynamics of trading and selling options are different in s&p plus no more anticipation of anything else really aside from price action.

I'll fourth this. VW went exponential\^(parabolic) because large volume share holders (not retail) refused to sell, limiting the available shares to buy and therefore driving the ask price sky high.

errr. I had puts against pltr and sold them at a loss. I might buy puts again but closer to the lockout period ends. Soros is planning on divesting and even Canadian government is asking Canada Pension Plan to revisit their investment in PLTR.
Pretty sure this means we're at the top. BUY PUTS AND SHORT

Didn't they get to sell a portion during the DPO? Or did the DPO only allow 'certain' holders to sell the 20% float?
One can easily argue the opposite. If it payed a ton they don't need special interest money and trading advantages or connections. Because the job already pays well.

If it doesn't pay well they are going to resort to the other means to get money anyway. So reduced salary doesn't change much for them if they are mostly there for other benefits.

Protip for using R/WSB:

Sometimes a stock gets spammed relentlessly and drives you crazy. But if you actually look at all the posts you‚Äôll see that hundreds of them come from just one shitty person.  MT is an example today. If you simply click their username and click block, all their spam goes away and the sub becomes useable again.

Definitely a new regime post COVID, all bets are off. However really interesting way to test out a theory. 

A few suggestions. The regression you‚Äôre showing looks like there‚Äôs not a huge correlation past those based on T-1 returns alone; since the retail memes this year tend to be episodic and take a few days/weeks to play out, maybe do a T-5, T-10 or other timescale regression? IE if stock X moons today given stocks that mooned in the last y weeks, what are the odds next week Z moons? Mooning isn‚Äôt necessarily a daily occurrence. 

Also, maybe do a sentiment scrape (literally of r/wallstreetbets) to see if that improves any of the findings and correlation? You might find that particularly since the sub is representative of a nontrivial quantity of retard retail option pumpers, there is some leading effect. In fact there is data to support this: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2pt0w/herding_by_naive_robin_hood_traders_what_yall/

Seems kind of toothless anyway. The power isn't in the stock trading, it's in the knowledge of when and which stocks to trade based on congressional business.

Nothing about that will change and no matter where a piece of legislation draws a line in the sand, it will be easy enough to operate on the other side of the line, because information can flow unchecked.

So they'll just set up shelf companies with an advisor/accountant/etc. and continue to inside trade. 

This legislation will just add an additional layer of abstraction so it isn't as visible, which will make it harder to hold them accountable at the ballot box.

I will only disagree with two of your points.

1. I think you overstate the dangers to the index. If  Tesla goes to $0 Christmas Eve, it‚Äôs about 60 points off the SP500, which is one semi bad day.

Now if the committee decides to put SNOW, DASH and ABNB in there too, it‚Äôs time to worry.

2. FCA has merged/unmerged many times through the years. I am quite sure they would be happily acquired by Tesla at a fat premium.

My goal right now is 100k profit in a day but thats going to be hard for my account type due to how its structured right now (less risky and no bulk weekly FDs).

I will get to the days where 100k in a day becomes the norm and then I will shoot for 1 million in a day.

Analfarmer or something like that? His strategy was doing box spreads which gave him infinite leverage. 

Fun addendum to the story: box spreads are typically done with all sides of spreads having the same exact strike price. That‚Äôs what he did and screwed Robinhood. Robinhood responded by fixing the risk glitch, BUT ONLY FOR SPREADS WITH THE SAME STRIKE. Last week a guy did the exact same thing, only he made the strike prices slightly different. This allowed the RH glitch to work again and once again give out infinite leverage. This new guy did the same stupid shit the first guy did and even claimed that it was impossible to lose and was free money. You‚Äôll be shocked and surprised to learn he blew up his account just like the first guy did. 

Good stuff.

This is the way
Short sellers do tend to have a longer timeframe than longs. They have to have the sophistication to borrow shares which all by itself is a filter that leaves behind the least experienced investors.

Also, I've said before GME has all the ingredients for a long term short position. They're not going to give up en masse just because GME has a good quarter or even a good year. However, IF this latest episode put the fear into the board and management and they truly make the business competitive online, then that changes everything.

I'm down for a couple of good years out of GME even if they don't change a thing.

By the way all this "priced in" bullshit makes me laugh. like the next year being good is "priced in". Really? Is that why the shares are up 14% since the news broke that there was a zerg rush to GS stores when they announced they had some PS5s? Yeah, it's priced in...no one could have predicted runs to the stores to get consoles. Rolling my eyes...

Reduce the amount you take gradually over a few weeks. I used to drink a lot of coffee but have since quit. At first you may experience some headaches but you can power through that. With the proper amount of sleep each night you don't need caffeine to stay alert.

Small quips.  192k is base salary.  Average benefits are an additional 32k.  Bringing it to closer to 224k.

Also, if you take out army/va docs that number will go way up (I noticed those were in the like 6 samples they used).  Don't know about va, so maybe that can stay, but benefits for us air force can be pretty substantial.

Yeah basically. The premiums were cheaper, they have been bidded up a bit now. My average px is 0.8 I imagine there are folks that got in even earlier.

The reason this is an attractive YOLO is if stimulus and money printer both land and we see some reopening this particular bundle of stocks will rocket.

It's not as dumb as "just buy SPY LEAPs can't lose!" but more like an educated bet that mid-caps and non-tech is going to get a big boost from economic recovery like the finance, industrial and commodity sectors will.

Jesus Christ. Nobody can be this stupid. 

Both sides agreed on a bill. They were ready to sign. Toomey came in at the last second and said he wants to block the Fed from being able to respond to crises in the future. That is insane. There is no negotiating that. It cannot be done or we‚Äôre all fucked. There is nothing to negotiate. 

It‚Äôs fucking amazing to me that you would see all that and instead of blaming the insane person attempting to add an insane requirement at the last second, you think the blame lies with everyone else.

You have to be a troll. No one is this fucking dumb.

Conspiracy theory: Now people are sharing clips from this type of ancient media for "satire" and talk shit about. It's to slowly normalize boomer media to WSB types. It starts out as "ironic" but many will stay, and watch unironically. This will slowly alter the social environment and bring together two radically different types of "investing".

It works for boomers because they will make more money by learning and using our strategies, but It will suck for us because we are overwhelmingly retardeder in comparison and these losers actually care about their money.

do you get the shares instantly?

im pretty sure exercise you get the shares hours later. so you can't just day trade in that fashion.

OP seems to have home ownership mentioned as a key milestone once you have 50-100k saved but I‚Äôd guess the majority of this sub would rather keep renting and try to invest/gamble in a market where the government is printing money and SoftBank is buying billions of dollars of tech stocks

Dude please sell that. I don‚Äôt even know you and I am worried for you lol. Good luck either way.
Pretty sure it shifts the whole chart down
The issue with SBE is that the merger is structured so that SBE shareholders are only buying like 10% of chargepoint.  Which means that the current $36 dollar share price is inflated because post merger the company will be worth 26ish billion (rough estimate) instead of the 2.65 billion SBE is currently "worth".  


I personally don't feel that it is worth 26 billion so I'm not buying.  If SBE was buying 100% of chargepoint instead of 10% I would buy.  


That said.....  SBE and pretty much all EV stocks are having Tesla levels of hype these days.  SBE may very well trade higher than 36 bucks post-merger...

I sold Kia's for like a month.  Safe vehicle.  At least it's what they told us.  I loved driving them though.  Very smooth.  A lot of the safety features are really attractive for a family as well.  My favorites were the Telluride and the Stinger!  That Stinger is a bad boy...
Good. I need those calls to start printing
not $mt tho

Need a TLDR..... desperately.
Not the TSLA ones tho
Because it is a poorly run government operation
Thanks, that's true 2.7% does look nice. Also down 9.7% past 5 days so probably not such a bad time to buy
you won't be bearish if u had mt calls
always seems to happen when there's bad news regarding coronavirus / the economy
Why is that something to celebrate?
Congressional stop loss?
They're both factors of 3.
So now they trade stocks through a shell, what changed?

No stimmy gonna make my stummy hurt
I want to agree with you. This may be a bit aggressive tho
What's the play for Micky BRUH
So as it stands, say it with me now, the post office isn‚Äôt profitable.
Ya, he should‚Äôve kept holding it, reinvesting it until he got a Tesla.

Wherever that place is I want to open a liquor storethat delivers across the street, I'd make enough to buy my own island.

It sucks a bag of dicks. Don‚Äôt get it if you can avoid it.
I think I‚Äôm mostly bearish just because I want these easy mode fucks to go away
Idk if it‚Äôs because they just don‚Äôt know enough about it at this point which that lack of not knowing could be a bad sign or you‚Äôre absolutely right, cause I agree that it could definitely be a trick at the same time

dude its $mt that's gunna moon. baby!

nah MT BRO
Canoo
Well, the bot told me to ask you for an update! Update?!
so is Share price for $mt
Based on past history, it seems logical and likely for the stock to dip as folks take profit.  However, let's say it opens high and continues going up, I still have lots of shares and call options on TSLA.
Not allowed to talk about this one because it's small cap, but Vuzix has been treating my account very well. My January call was up 800% on Friday at one point, still holding it.
Those minks have been watching generations of their forebears turned into coats, just biding their time

I‚Äôm feeling the bulls are going to get crushed Monday

Republicans trying to pull the plug on the fed printer.
If they could fund their pension the same as any other department or any private shipper they would be insanely profitable. As the article clearly states, which is proof you didn‚Äôt fucking read it because stupid people don‚Äôt read, the entire reason the GOP added that insane 75 year requirement to their books WAS BECAUSE THE POST OFFICE WAS TOO PROFITABLE.IT WAS EARNING TOO MUCH PROFIT.
No doubt Sorkin hasn‚Äôt seen a cock he doesn‚Äôt like.

Would you say it's your "fourth wedge" since it is your cake day? :D
Sell side for life.
People get elected to office for only one reason -to SERVE the people. To represent them and do what they want. They WORK for the people. So, helping us ain't part of their job description. Doing our bidding is the job description. Doesna make sense to pay them to watch out for their interests. Sorry, I get high on their shit.

Never gonna happen, because the biggest long positions aren't in the hands of the retards who hang out here.

They have entry and exit points.
Gotta have that new iPhone!
You don‚Äôt know how to read obviously my guy. Downvote me all you want moron. Look at that fucking chart in there and covid is not the second highest number for under 60???? Retard
You are all wrong, they should get paid a shit ton, then you would have motivated people competing to get in. Not a bunch of morons that couldn‚Äôt make it in the real world so to speak. And when you get paid a shit ton, you are less likely to except bribes and corruption.

Don't understand why people seem bearish...the Fed lifting buyback restrictions on banks yesterday afternoon is incredibly bullish.
Where was that money going to be taken from and how can we not expect it to f us in the future
If it opens green Monday don‚Äôt sell in the morning. If it goes red Monday, don‚Äôt sell eod. Sell Tuesday morning. Just my two cents.
I trust the chicken more than Micheal Burry
nah go with $mt

How do you calculate your max profit? I like doing this with the long at a further out date than the short (diagonal spread) so that theta is positive for the position. Helps me sleep at night knowing that I'm guaranteed to 75 cents if the stock stays flat hahaha. My the odds be in your favor.

You‚Äôve obviously never met a tenured professor at a university.
We're not really in a bull market tho. We certainly were, from March-August.

Since then, though, we've really been rather choppy and range-bound. Just as many red days as green, and periods of upturn and periods of downturn.

In fact, if you factor in the dropping USD, we're actually in a bear market, really. The actual value of the indexes have been going down, pretty consistently, for a few months now.

SPX is up like 4% since September 1st, but the USD is down like 6%. That's a net loss in actual value. 

I agree with not fighting the trend, but this ain't June anymore. There is no trend.

Then short it, dude. We all know they don‚Äôt sell as many cars as those businesses - that doesn‚Äôt matter. 

It‚Äôs an unsophisticated view of the market. You need to consider the cost to sell and possible expansion of all of those organizations which is high and minimal respectively for most of them. 

Tesla is overweight - ya. But I‚Äôm not going to bet against it because they don‚Äôt sell as many cars as Chrysler.

Jesus fucking Christ. I‚Äôve now explained to you three times how the post office is a profitable operation. It only looks like it has deficits  because of insane pension funding requirements that fuck up its books. I will not try a fourth.

If you don't pay politicians the only people will to do the work would be people who are already rich enough to not need a salary to live off of. How is someone that doesn't live off passive income supposed to work full time as a senator while paying for travel and multiple homes if you just want to give them a crap wage?

Also you're really glossing over the fact that politicians have always tended to come from the upper class. Do you think the founding fathers weren't part of the wealthy elite of the time?

Common misconception that you can deduct 100% of charitable contributions. In reality, you can only reduce your tax bill by 25% ish of the amount you donate so it costs you way more in absolute terms

The coverage on the night was very suspect, trying to frame out bernie and yang supporters, saying there was a huge turn out for mayor pete but seeing through their camera bernie had clearly a bigger turn out. Then the extra votes through the counting that went to major pete which was dodgy. Maybe not rigged, but wouldn't be surprised

First of all, I don‚Äôt know why you have such a hard on about the fucking postal service lmao.  Probably have a little stamp collection at home. A quick google search will show you that they have been running up a deficit for the past decade. That‚Äôs not efficient.  Simple as that.  We can argue the merits of keeping it around, I‚Äôm not saying to get rid of the police or firemen, but saying that it is efficiently run is just objectively wrong lol.
In the game of life there are winners and there are losers. Try to be a winner.
Any good ideas?
I believe manipulating the building of infrastructure to boost their real estate value is a larger cause of how they accumulate wealth while in office. The other issue is that they "investigate" and police themselves for insider trading and similar ethical issues. Congress/politics is a helluva dirty game
Just to add. For VW - it wasn‚Äôt just two longs. One was the government of Bavaria, which by law was not going to sell their 20% stake. The other was Porsche, which acquired a 76% stake through options and shares, which looked like it was going to be a takeover
That post with the boat saying moar theta is life goals. Bums buying calls in hopes of making ten baggers are giving free money to the whales.

You already make 175k a year as a member of congress. So without the insider trading they already have quite a cozy financial position. They could easily play fair and just do property investments and shit but they are not only greedy but lazy as well.

LMND buys AAPL for 3T
They already released their draft legislation, it's nowhere near the scale of what US is proposing.

Both the new fintech requirements and the new anti-monopoly initiatives are very level headed and good/bullish signals imo.

If anything both amount to regulatory capture for Tencent and Alibaba as they will make it much harder for new entrants to use the same tactics they used to beat down competitors on their rise up.

the problem with tax fraud and securities is the brokerages are required to report the basis and sales amounts to the IRS - or somewhere I have no idea. so yeah go for it - commit tax fraud - but committing tax fraud on trading securities will get you absolutely no where.

WhatsApp and Instagram will be worth billions on their own and FB will go up in value.

This is what people don't understand. The public is going to be over this thing in a few months and a new strain biologically cannot evolve into a deadlier virus in such a short timeframe. People will latch on to the newest bad news and this thing will be a nightmare from the past.
They don't need to be paid less because we still want to have quality people in the position.  The educational level alone required to understand the fundamentals of the job alone is expensive. Why take away all incentive? I like the mutual fund idea too. What you didn't plan on was the book deals and speaking tours. Those two things are how politicians take their payouts in a legal way, unless you really think Jill Biden made over 14,500,000mil one year.

If it makes you feel any better, I put a total of 1600 in. That was beginning of this year and got up to like 2400. Not that big, and then I lost a sizable chunk thanks to September drop.

If I were to then lose that 300k on Jan 1, would I still owe 100k in taxes, even if the money never left my brokerage account? What if I take that 300k and turn it into 600k in 2021. How will that be taxed? At initial investment of 300k?

I mean theres plenty of literature about how british public housing used to be the envy of the world and there are plenty of public housing complexes in austria and scandanvia

&#x200B;

but mostly the quality of housing stock is down to the intention of the program. If its to suplement the housing market by providing affordable housing to people as a way to put downward presure on the housing market, and is intended to be a good consumed by poor and middle income people alike then it works. If you just want a "social safty net" that you only give to the poorest of the poor who wait on a quota for 4 years to get it and you fund it with the intention of only housing like 2% of the population with it, then of course its going to be filled with degenerate crackheads and the dregs of society.

Social programs can be good but it depends on a society's attitude and strategy towards them. If you made 20% of the NYC housing stock public housing thats decent quality and designed to break even or return the city government like 3% annually then youre going to get a healthy affordable city. If you just make these places crack dens that are drains on their city's budget because they can only charge their residents 40 bucks a year and they are dependent on the tax payer for every little piece of damage that happens to them then of course you're going to get the situation you have today.

‚ÄúYou clearly just reject things not based on merit or fact but based on whether they fit your political narrative‚Äù Lmfao pot meet kettle. What I‚Äôm saying is not controversial, the government does not run things efficiently.  Go to a VA hospital, go to the DMV, look at our education system, look at the Congress that is deadlocked and about to crash the market because they don‚Äôt want to give a fraction of what they already spend on their bloated ever growing government agencies that continue to give diminished returns (yes I know this is Republicans, I know your liberal tirades assume everyone who disagrees with you must be conservative, but it‚Äôs not true). If you want to continue to be a Government boot-licker your whole life that‚Äôs fine but the real boogeyman isn‚Äôt privatization it‚Äôs big Government, and it always has been.
So you came here and gambled on someone reading that wall of text?
welp, of course pay taxes, what are you planning to do not report? then pay penalty + interest. The IRS knows what you sold the stonks for, so you better report them. I've seen the letters for people who forgot, the IRS doesn't take basis into account at all and charges gains on the entire amount of sales.

Retards want to make money, also support anti-capitalist money-illiterates. Next thing r/witchesvspatriarchy will go full-retard Newt Gingrich pro-life MAGA
I think they probably should allow some restricted trading-meaning you can invest your money but only once per quarter and the trades must be entered and made public well in advance. Meaning you can put in an order to buy and sell but you need to put it in a month+ in advance so you can‚Äôt abuse confidential information. 
Completely restricting stock investments is honestly probably over the top since a lot of people hold their wealth large in their investments
Yup. As the President with a Senate majority and an opposition House that would have passed $2T deal easily I think he supremely fucked up strategically here. Free money is a free election, doesn't take a retard to know that.

He also could have really beaten down the power of the Senate to fuck with him if he won a second term by going against McConnell. It would put all of the Senate cronies on notice that he can't be fucked with.

Once again, fortunate he isn't that smart because he is a racist, misogynistic idiot but it does go to show how powerful a similarly corrupt GOP President could be if they had a brain.

I think not playing aggressively is also a good long term play! And some people definitely have gambling addictions and make bad choices for the meme of it. 

I just think that‚Äôs relatively few people? The exceptions are when the sub gets into a frenzy like PLTR and GME and people start blowing their rent money on weeklies but those folks don‚Äôt last long. 

Ultimately everyone has different life circumstances and risk thresholds! The rational play is the one that is well considered and fits your life.

Why compare the absolute value of QQQJ calls with SPY calls?  SPY share price is an order of magnitude higher than this. If you scale it accordingly, you will see that a 16% otm spy call option in June is significantly cheaper than this. That being said, this ETF could rise much quicker than SPY so this comparison should not be done probably

Hell yea
hmmm yea i could see that happening. I could see waiting about 5 years for tesla to have a major break out again. Which is what already happened from like 2013 to 2019 honestly. However i don't think tesla is comparable to ibm or cisco I think its closer to microsoft or amzn. and 20 years later those 2 stocks have more than 10x even from the highs. So ill be find just holding tesla and accumulating.

I don‚Äôt see the urgency. There‚Äôs going to be literally months if not years of no real news as this company continues to develop its fleet of giant satellites. Plus tons can go wrong. 

I just don‚Äôt think this company can garner a ton of hype and hold it for a few years until it finally delivers on its business plan. Just my two cents. 

Also do you know the terms of the deal?
This so much. Right now the market rewards unrelenting aggression and relying on total market uptrend to recoup any losses.

Buy growth stocks, leverage hard with options and make money while it lasts. QE could be around forever but there is no guarantee so now is the best time to play hard.

Optics. They do not give a fuck whether a stimulus would help people.  They care about whether they can stand in front of their voters at reelection time and tell a consistent narrative that they support small government and oppose government spending.

Oh most definitely. I made a longer comment to the other guy but the only reason Mitch is even considering stimulus is to dangle a carrot in front of voters in Georgia. Either Mitch concedes to the Dems demands or we go into a run-off election without stimulus, which is likely bad news for the GOP. Thank GOD the Dems are playing hardball. It's the only way you stand a chance against the GOP and Mitch.

I agree it should've been passed much earlier. McConnel wasn't even willing to hear discussion until it was clear Trump had lost and the senate majority hung in the balance.

You can't negotiate with terrorists like the GOP. When they finally are willing to negotiate, that's when you know things are looking bad for them. Dems need a rallying cry to get voters to come back out again otherwise we fall apart within the next 2 years during a Biden administration, due to GOP majority in the senate. And the dumb's will blame it all on Biden.

Word of advice from someone who has been doing this for years: Always take direct ownership of your trades, and don‚Äôt expect your broker to automatically do anything that somehow makes your trade profitable or your losses less severe. Brokers are in the business of making themselves money, not making you money.

Okay, if both calls are ITM, you should close them right before expiration (refer back to my word of advice). That means simultaneously buying to close your short call and selling your long call. Why? Because most option trades are significantly cheaper than the $17-$25 brokers charge in assignment fees. What happens to the premium you paid for the long call? Kinda depends if your short position was originally far enough OTM, so that the stock rising above that strike would result in a gain large enough to overcome the premium you paid for it. But, yes, if done correctly, if both calls are ITM and are properly closed out before expiration, you should be able to make some money or at least avoid a loss.

You lack a fundamental understanding of the differences between ARM and x86. The same goes for cost. The M1 has a 120mm¬≤ die on TSMCs 5nm process, which certainly is a lot more expensive than a 10900K for example, which uses about 200mm¬≤ on Intels old 14nm process. In 5nm it would be smaller than a M1. A single Zen3 CPU-chiplet uses about 80mm¬≤ on TSMCs 7nm.

As you can see, the M1 is pretty large for a 5nm chip and most likely more expensive than a 10900K. It also loses out in many different multi-threaded tasks. Yes, its a SoC, but Intel also includes a GPU and SoC capability for example.

I guess you mean well, but you dont know what you are talking about.

I knew you were going to make that stupid, uninformed argument, which is why I preempted it before you even said it. The post office is profitable. I‚Äôll try to say this again slower this time, maybe borrow some crayons. It only appears to be unprofitable because of the GOP‚Äôs insane demand that they fully fund their pension system out 75 years. An insane demand that no other department or private company has to do. It was an obvious attempt to destroy it. 

I‚Äôm not even going to touch your idiotic ‚Äúsocial security is a tax‚Äù comment.  

The bottom line is this: you‚Äôre not smart enough to be having this conversation, and what‚Äôs more you clearly just reject things not based on merit or fact but based on whether they fit your political narrative you‚Äôve already decided must be true, facts be damned.
It shouldn‚Äôt even need to be made into law. Just have the new SEC have a regulation preventing it.

If so, then you might be able to write off the entire cost of the car (or a %, based on what % you use the car for business).

What are you guys thoughts on (ET) energy transfer ?
That's fair. TBH, I don't know too much about the company, which is why I tagged this as TA and not DD. I noticed some rotation back into clean energy and FCEL seemed like it had the most upside with the current price pattern. For long term hold, I would probably go with an ETF like ICLN or TAN, but FCEL has a chance for a big breakout within the next month or 2 which is what I'm trying to cash out on with calls instead of shares.
everyone downvote so no one sees this
2/10. Ford is boring, Unity has a $40b valuation on $700m in revenue, Kelloggs will probably take 30 years to appreciate by 40%, and same for Citi. Get you some growth.
If we hit a crash later in the year, I'll probably just buy BETZ and QQQJ shares and hold long term while I build up my gambling fund again slowly. They are both long term holds for me and I wish I could have bought leaps, but alas none were offered for QQQJ

you're welcome. There is an ascending resistance (which TSLA didn't break in one push so far)  around 720s. My theory is that it might open higher and push to those lvls and pull back for a bit, maybe until next catalyst, which could be TSLA delivering over 500k units for this year and a much aggressive outlook for next year.  So lets see, and good luck to all!! I am still bullish long term cuz I think ROBO taxis are not priced in yet!! and TSLA's energy will boom in 2021!!!

I don‚Äôt even have a car. I bought a 2013 Honda bike. Cheap on gas and insurance and goes like shit off a shovel.
As i said in another comment, here is my concern over giving TSLA 100% winner tag on this.

1) If autonomous software becomes increasingly expensive, will it be really worth to pay as much as a car and would this cannibalize even the car sales 
2) If it is not going to be significantly expensive, is the technology create that much of a monopolistic power in giving all the benefits to TSLA vs any other company, again, 20 years down the road. Once again, having great technology is one thing, making so much money out of it is another.

Completely argue with power of data, but still cannot think software related advantage in the earlier years will always play out in your favor down the road, again we are not talking about next 2-3 years, we are probably looking at least a full decade before this thing is widely spread.

Lot of comments, l but i think something is missing.  I think there is a nice sized slice of IT folks on here making 75k-150k ( more if in a city like sf or ny ) who have a company matching 401k then are doing this on the side.  Im 39 , my options jacking around is the last of the money i invest.

You can‚Äôt lose 50K because you‚Äôll never win 50K to lose. 

There are a lot of people on here like me. Relatively young professionals with expendable incomes and high risk tolerance. You put 55K or so in the market and given how forgiving it has been this year you turn that into 75K, then you start going harder with your gains. 

You also start see survivorship bias. So winners keep showing up and for losers we only get a few spectacular losses a day from a huge community. 

Most people go up and down thousands every day and it just generally trends up. Every so often you hit a huge winner and come brag. 

I‚Äôve had multiple stocks go up this week by over 10% a day multiple times. That‚Äôs a conservative investors good year in a day. I‚Äôve had plenty of options go up 50-100% this week and I‚Äôve gotten hosed on a few too. It‚Äôs the nature of this market. 

Ultimately it‚Äôs prudent and rational to play this massive, aggressive expansionary market aggressively.
This is basic stuff. Just because you‚Äôre too stupid to understand it doesn‚Äôt mean everyone is.
Thanks! Happy to provide some distraction for the day.

im not laughing at you, i promise. laughing at the stereotype that they can afford to lose any money. you can probably figure out why. the problem with your framing is it attempts to find a rationality that doesn‚Äôt exist. If you make 500k a year losing 50k is _insane_ look up the story Of Victor Niederhoffer. Or better yet look at a trade that‚Äôs gained 100% and after you close it, at a loss, look back and ask why the fuck did you want more and not take profits? It‚Äôs the same behaviors that lead a person making 50k/ur or 500k/year to make dumb decisions.

Again, I think the issue I see here is that we've already attributed TSLA as the winner of whole FSD, AI and all that. That part, I think it's far from being done.
The reason why I say is that, currently, FSD is far from being complete. Yet, the price tag $10k is expensive, and it will only get more expensive. Then you have two outcomes:

1) If autonomous software becomes increasingly expensive, will it be really worth to pay as much as a car and would cannibalize even the car sales
2) If it is not going to be significantly expensive, is the technology create that much of a monopolistic power in giving all the benefits to TSLA vs any other company, again, 20 years down the road. Once again, having great technology is one thing, making so much money out of it is another.

Completely argue with power of data, but still cannot think software related advantage in the earlier years will always play out in your favor down the road, again we are not talking about next 2-3 years, we are probably looking at least a full decade before this thing is widely spread.

The Enhancement of Community Survival. 

I mean, money didn‚Äôt always exist.. it‚Äôs essentially all a fiat or barter. What if we barter work, and don‚Äôt make it a POD action?

There have been studies showing that people do better work when they‚Äôre motivated by honest gratitude and by the skill of their own performance more so than cash.  Plenty of artists exist and they are not getting paid to do so.. but they still paint and write and sing.

I spent a lot of time learning guitar, but no one paid me to do it until after I was decent. And now, a few hundo for an hour of jamming is pretty slick, but it‚Äôs not why I book gigs.

What if I told you ‚ÄúEvery single human could have food, clothing, housing, utilities, healthcare, and luxuries...  and we can go live on Mars.. if we kill off CEOs and disregard the entire concept of currency and work together.‚Äù  

 ‚ÄúYou could be in the generation that saves Mankind from extinction.‚Äù   Capitalism isn‚Äôt going to fix the climate issue.  We seriously have 10yrs to figure this out or our species won‚Äôt see another 500.

Like... basically...  I agree to keep working at Pizza Hut and you agree to keep being a mechanic.  When we need each other, we agree to do the job.  And we don‚Äôt whine about who is better or more important.  But I guarantee people eat more pizzas than they get oil changes.  We all need each other equally.   Ego and pride make us think differently.

Politicians and paper-pushers wouldn‚Äôt benefit from this, so they mislead and lie and help fund Red Scare propaganda.

America is so uneducated about what Socialism means, that we just had a diet-Fascist president as a way to ‚Äústop socialism‚Äù while the people cry about healthcare and college debt and inflation.  

Socialism is legitimately what America needs and wants, but they think it means ‚ÄúBig Govt Dictatorship‚Äù while it really means ‚ÄúSmaller More-Regulated Govt&Corps.‚Äù

Banning lawmakers from trading stocks is too extreme, and will probably never pass because it goes too far. So it's a great way to appear like you're doing something while knowing you're not actually going to do anything.

The reasonable thing to do is to change the law so lawmakers are treated the same way as corporate insiders and have to disclose their trades in advance. The same should be true of all senior government officials.

I‚Äôm going to disagree with the OP a little.

This pattern isn‚Äôt by itself bullish or bearish, but once out of the wedge/pennant either up or down, the price tends to run in that direction for awhile. Generally, the height of the pattern itself. (Roughly $10).

People tend to think the pattern usually resolves in the direction of the trend leading into it, which is probably why OP indicates bullishness.

The texts on the topic say it‚Äôs about a 60/40 call on that part.

But they have to have two homes. And travel a lot. There expenses are more than double the average American. Poor people are easier to bribe. And you also get less quality people when you pay people less. If I want to hire the best software engineer I won‚Äôt pay 10 dollars an hour. Higher pay attracts higher quality individuals. Even if someone wants to help and has good intentions, if they had the option to work in the private sector and make six figures or more or take a low paying job working in government they would generally choose the private sector. Doctors are important to society so we pay them high. You could argue people should be doctors not to make money but to help people. But if you decrease the wages of doctors in order to get better doctors you will end up getting the opposite. You want to attract talented people from the private sector and pay them enough to make the job worth it. Make them unable to trade stocks but if you increase the salary of Congress you will attract more candidates and give people more options to choose from, thus producing higher quality candidates.

Yeah quite happy with margin covered naked puts.  I started selling them before earnings with mid Jan and mid April strike prices, about half at 10 and half at 15 strike prices, and the puts have already lost about half their value with the stock price staying roughly flat, which is a great return in a few weeks. I'm not committed enough to expect the stock to moon but expecting flat or upward trends on a high IV stock = great time to sell puts.
And leg day is the worst day
Wild guess but companies really dont know when they are getting hacked and they probably towards incident response.

No one knows about the concentrated short position. It is just speculation.

Even then, the number of shorts vs number of longs does not matter. It matters on whether they have to cover (to avoid the interest loss etc) and how many longs are willing to sell enough shares to allow them to cover. Most of the shorted positions are underwater and someone claimed the trigger point for Melvin was $18.5 to start covering (if we are speculating...)

If the squeeze trigger is a shareholder vote recall, the ratio for shorts will be far worse than 12:1.

Even though they seem knowledgeable and are right about the VW scenario (very few people get 12:1 ratio right), saying it will \_never\_ squeeze like VW is plain wrong.

This is not a fucking stock, it will not move like a stock.  It is a fucking ETF with 100 stocks in it.  So it will move slowly and in relation to the nasdaq as a whole.  This is a variant of the QQQ ETF.  And if you look at June calls 16% out for QQQ and scale it to this thing you can see that this ETF does not actually have dirt cheap options.  It looks like a great ETF if you have a conservative portion of your portfolio.  But you are kind of betting on the NASDAQ to go up 20% by summer to break even, which is of course 40% annualized.  A NASDAQ that has gone up 40% in a year despite the pandemic, and is up 90% since the pandemic lows.  Sure bet on a fragile, still recovering economy that still won't be clear of the virus by summer, and with a democrat president the republicans will do everything they can to make look bad.  they're already trying to hobble the fed in the stimulus bill so Biden won't have the free money flow that there was under trump.

Comparing one anomaly to another, I think that‚Äôs a fair comparison. Investors are betting on Elon, seeing that he has transformed multiple industries at once. However, that alone doesn‚Äôt justify the rich valuation of Tesla as it stands today. 

Given Tesla‚Äôs margin on EV‚Äôs, I believe it will continue to be much higher than it is today with the constructions of multiple giga-factories in different regions, thus the economy of scale. Then we can factor in Full Self-Driving as a revenue, as the price rises consistently with new improvements. Tesla‚Äôs EV revenue = vehicle sales x autonomous software. As it stands today, Tesla has the largest database for autonomous AI training. Every Tesla car on the road is collecting data in real life to improve AI learning. I have yet to see any other autonomous software company doing anything close to what Tesla is doing. With its vertical integration, Tesla can optimize their software to our own vehicles. From a product standpoint, it will be hard to beat their superiority. That brings you to branding, which I don‚Äôt see a lot of people talk about. Tesla has such a strong brand which in itself is of value to investors. When we think EV, we think Tesla. I think that is the way it will be going forward.

Yes. If you have an option that closes ITM, it will assign automatically over the weekend.

Then, if it‚Äôs a call, you have shares, but are short money.

If it‚Äôs a put, you have cash, but are short stock.

Both can lead to extra losses.

Example: You buy a 1 week call on PLTR at $27 for $1. Current price $26.

At the end of the week PLTR ends at $27.25.

The option gets assigned at $27, but you owe the brokerage $2700. If you don‚Äôt have that on account you go into margin.

Then say the following Monday, there‚Äôs a downgrade of PLTR and it opens at $25.

You sell the 100 shares you were assigned for $2500.

But you owe the brokerage $2700.

So your losses:

$100 on the original call
$200 after assignment

I disagree. We should pay them more but not allow them to trade stocks directly. If you don‚Äôt pay them then you will only get rich people running for Congress. Most congress members make way more in private sector than public sector, but things like book sales are what brings in the money. That‚Äôs why Bernie is a millionaire. With lower pay you will just have Donald trump and the Kennedy family types in Congress. Altruism is bullshit and no one is or should be purely altruistic. Saying Congress people should work for little money will just make them more corrupt because they will need to do speaking tours and take more lobbyists money if they are not already millionaires or billionaires.
Take this with a grain of salt, but my opinion is that FCEL is garbage...  

They are essentially a copy of PLUG power but without hydrogen forklifts in Amazon warehouses.  Their stock price is only going up because they are benefiting from the success of PLUG power which is raising the whole hydrogen power industry.

Classic example of the 95% that dont make it in the market long term. Thank you for your existance.
The makeup of the 1.8T bill was ass though. It wasn‚Äôt just a proportionally scaled back version of the 2.2T she was pushing for.

GOP was pulling out local aid and unemployment benefits, and child tax credits and replaced them with corporate tax cuts and livability protections.

It‚Äôs like if you wanted 2.2T of gold and I offered 1.8T of feathers and saying that you‚Äôre a bad negotiator for turning it down.

Politicians get almost all their money from "donations", "speaking engagements", "book sales" and board appointments to "private" companies or "philanthropic" NGOs.

The only reason the inner party is even considering doing this (you're right they probably won't anyway) is because they don't care about this meager source of wealth that benefits the outer party moreso than the inner.
That's such a stupid reason. MOC get paid 6 figures. They can live offa savings for the few weeks it takes to reopen the gov. No MOC is gonna starve if they shutdown for a month or so.

We're not doing this for money.  We're doing it for a shit load of money.
I disagree, it is a very intense job that should be taken seriously as the highest level to a long career. It should be paid enough to attract really good people, and they shouldn't have to work 90 hours a week for very little pay. They should be rewarded for the sacrifices they make. And I want them to work long hard hours and make sacrifices.

They also have a lot of expenses that aren't covered that they have to afford themselves. 

I don't want fat cat politicians who don't need to work. I don't want only the wealthy to run for office or only the people that look at it as a good way to get what they want out of the position, for them, their family, or coworkers. 

I want them to be comfortable enough to not moonlight on other jobs, not worry about making expensive mortgage hills. I want them to concentrate on doing the best job governing.

Plus, if you look at it on a world perspective, the poorest paid politicians are universally the most corrupt throughout the world. Why do we think in the US it would be any different.

Ladies and Gents, don't you see? Don't you see the massive gold trophy before our eyes? We WANT those two to be the last ones left holding their position because they'll be holding a massive bag! If all the smaller shorts get out =the price rises, which means more people might jump on the bandwagon which long terms hurts those two massive short positions! It would be one thing if they could hold it indefinitely without much pain, but this is 100% not the case!

1)They have to pay borrowing fees, they have to put up more bag as collateral against their ever growing losses as the price rises because the smaller shorts can't hold on.

2) as we all continue to üíéüôåüèæ diamond hand this baby to a 10x bagger (maybe 100x!) They are taking on much more losses than us. They have a board and shareholders to Answer to IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. We take on what losses? The opportunity cost of making this a 10x bagger? You see any other 130%+ short positions out here? Neither do i.

Time is on our side boys , not there's,  as we shrink the float, their borrowing fees increase, sports do put, age price rises on a feedback loop. Idk about you.

just the general comment to everybody here. It's important when you're buying options to list a price that's lower than the offered price Don't just dive in and let your trading app recommend a price range for you. You can specify your entry point and that way it's going to keep the price of the options lower and if you let your app specify a wide range.

Pent up demand, one direction or another. Bulls and bears duking it out to decide fate. Sideways trading. If the events leading up to the wedge are an indication, it's like a rocket ready for blastoff, because it failed to follow the "natural trajectory" of the path it was originally on. 

If the narrative that pulled it down doesn't stick (Citron short, etc), it will likely experience a huge break out upwards very quickly. The alternative could happen if people flee the battlefield trying to get out alive.

Let me tell you what happened the last three months...


‚ÄúStimulus talks going‚Äù
Principles.
Not necessarily true. A richer person may have more financial interests impacted by legislation or politics
You're probably right, this week has been bullish as hell for GME. Bury or Cohen selling off their entire positions can still send this stock tumbling down to $10-13 range, but I think even without them, a few good quarterly earnings will send this into $25-30 range easily, it just might take more time to unwind, considering shorties won't be pressured into covering ASAP.
this post is really long so I assume it's good. Should I buy leaps or weeklies?

No you autist, that's not what the table is showing smh... It says that 98% of FAILED positions (about 1.07 million total shares - way less than 69.75 million outstanding and 49.42 million shares in the float) are underwater.

It LITERALLY states "% of Fails Underwater", it doesn't state "% of shorts underwater". Not all shorted shares are Failed-to-Deliver, only 1.09 million.

The thing is theres gonna be a lot of stops on the way in this moon mission...i might try taking some profits and then buying dips. Like Michael Burry sold off a ton of his stake - a closer look at his holdings makes it seem like he wants GME to be capped at a 5% weight in his fund. I think its very safe to assume he‚Äôll keep that balance going forward so if GME doubles in a week or something, he‚Äôs gonna offload a big position. Idk how the other big holders are strategizing but quite a few have sold lately

On the other hand wells fargo like 500% their stake or something
I heard obama is gonna close gitmo

I'd do whatever I could to make universal healthcare happen in this country.
My professional stakeholders trust me and the team to deliver value to them. Nonetheless we still meet once a quarter to align. That's because big decisions are a joint process. 

Trust != transparency. I run things by my boss to make sure there's no miscommunication, not because my boss doesn't trust me.

Not only that but I tell my partner things because that's what partners are for. If I did something as big as purchasing a multimillion dollar building I would tell her that day because that's what relationships are about. Sounds like you and your partner aren't that close if you don't even care to tell them about this until a month later. I'd suggest working on your communication issues.

Actually in the 90s Toyota offered to let GM and Ford tour their facilities after their was a great deal of issues with US auto manufacturing (intentional sabotage and all kinds of fun stuff). 

Apparently US auto makers were just as snobby as their employees. They refused any help. After multiple failed attempts to fix their own problems they finally took Toyota up on their offer. Toyota spent several weeks teaching US auto makers ambassadors their methodologies such as giving every line worker the ability to halt production and their philosophy of kaizen continuous improvement. 

I realized after several years of working for a Japanese company in an American facility that we were the assholes whose culture fostered the majority of problems. Despite our possible liberal cultural progression we are very much so self-centered narcissist.

Have you ever met someone you've been uneasy about? There's no specific reason why, just everything gives you this certain intuition about them.

That is your brain functioning at such speed and efficiency, that you are picking up on things subconsciously, that you aren't even really noticing. 
You are seeing everything at once, and yet not really seeing anything at all.

I scroll through DD's with my eyes fixated solely on the middle of the screen. Pages whizzing past me, never conciously reading a single word. I absorb all information without even knowing it. 

I see market charts the same way Neo see's his surroundings in the matrix.

The big problem I have with TSLA valuation ist the following: Most people forget about carmakers like Daimler, VW, BMW, Toyota etc. Daimler and BMW are launching 12 (!!!) mid to high end EVs 2021. VW (Audi, VW, Skoda, Porsche and Seat) launches 50 EVs until 2025 and will invest 35 bn. ‚Ç¨ by then. Just think about the full electric Mercedes S class with 490 miles range launching in one year; who will ever buy a model S again? Not to speak of Toyota and chinese EV makers in the low to mid price range. Tesla is getting crushed from the top by the germans and from the bottom by the asians. They are losing substantial market shares in western europe and asia right now (even befor all those above mentioned models have launched). And to be honest: AuTOpiLOt is nothing a mercedes, audi or beamer ca≈Ñt do. They got the same driving aids! TSLA is just a marketing machinery.

I was told not to talk about it, but I'm facing 2-14 years. What's funny is that I was also told by one lawyer to *not* go for the plea deal and go into trial. Arrest was almost 13 months ago, before the pandemic started. 

Here in Canada, we have a time-limit between arrest and trial, but I don't think it's valid in extreme circumstances like during a pandemic.

The problem with this is that it only incentivizes rich people to run for congress. Each state has different salaries for congressional positions, in CA and NY I think it's pretty good, like $70-$90K on average. In West Virginia it's like $30K...

&#x200B;

So why would anyone with a family do a ton of work of running for congress in WV to barely get paid and support their own family when some asshole coal tycoon can do it and not care about the salary because he already has a lot of money. We need to pay politicians for this reason.

Lets be honest we only care about the stimulus because its free gambling money.
I agree with that thinking
So the key thing is, are you able to afford the payments and are you going to be there a while. If yes it's a good time to buy with low interest rates. But if you are looking to move in two years no. The market may drop and then you will be upside-down but in say 5-9 years you maybe ahead again then you can sell. So main thing is if you can comfortably cover the payments and you don't worry about market dropping in two years bc you are not selling.
Its definitely cheating if you're monogamous.

TA is complete bullshit bro. And no, the chart is different for everybody because every trader/invester has different goals, entry price,  target exit price, strategy, investment time horizon.

I'm guessing you're talking about the $35c for 6/20. The most OTM call available on that ticker. The break even on that is +16% 

It seems like it could be a good investment, the etf has grown 15% since IPO a little less than 3 months ago. 


I think in order to really see the profitability you'll want to ride it out at least till March. ETFs move slowly.  I've never held a call that long, I always want to trade around. Might be worth yoloing on and then quitting trading for a few months lol.

Lmao don‚Äôt trade options if you don‚Äôt know how they work. I would suggest doing a lot of research before doing your first trades. But to answer your question, if your calls expire below the stop price then they expire worthless and you lose the premium that you paid for the call and do not come out of it with any shares.
I second OptimusPrivate. It depends on your time frame (how long you will spend in that house), your job, your savings, etc. This is a very frothy market though. All assets can see a collapse if shit hits the fan

I get what you mean with the girls on hinge not being hot. You essentially have to hack the app. There‚Äôs tons of hot girls and a ton of the scammy fat ones too. When you first download the app, activate premium mode and swipe through every hot girl you come across till you‚Äôre tired. If hinge detects that at least one hot girl likes you back, the algorithm will keep showing you hot girls. If you slump eventually and don‚Äôt maintain activity with girls that are on top of the algorithm, you‚Äôll end up seeing the fat ugly girls.
It is... doesn't mean the market is rational all of a sudden

I'm a pretty big deal on r/funny
Yeah for the market to stay bullish, the dollar has to continue to be weak.  If the dollar gets stronger, possibly due to euro weakness which is likely, the dollar will gain value, and big money will start pulling back from equities.  And since we are running this market hot as hell trying to stay away from stagflation mark, if they let the dollar fly back in value  we will see huge lows.
Depending on the brokerage and the company. I have seen several 401(k) plans with a self directed option. You basically open an account that is tied to the plan under with the same brokerage, and you can transfer your money into it. Then you can trade anything. But no margin and maybe options.

For wax removal you want something less plush so it has more bite to remove excess wax. Whereas polish needs a more plush one so you don‚Äôt scratch anything wiping off residue.

A lot of government is competent. The problem is it‚Äôs largely controlled by the Senate.

I‚Äôm in 500 shares of FCEL, bagholding after the equity offering and selling some CCs/CSPs to soften the blows. The only good reason I found for the Friday rally is this: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/18/2147796/0/en/FuelCell-Energy-Seeks-to-Have-Project-Awards-Restored.html?utm_campaign=cityfalcon&utm_medium=cityfalcon&utm_source=cityfalcon

I can‚Äôt explain it otherwise. Still, I do agree with your TA, I had similar findings. The only ‚Äúproblem‚Äù I have is that I‚Äôll have to roll my 1/15 $10 calls to give it more room to run. Personally, I hope it consolidates below $10 next week after this recovery rally. I remain bullish on the stock and I think this recovery is a sign of long term strength.
At the end of the day, if you are happy with your potential purchase, go for it.

This will probably get buried, but the key here is to find companies that not only offer software, but also make a killing with their incident response and breach remediation services.  FEYE is arguably the best in the business with their IR services, CRWD is solid as well.  

Both companies are going to be selling the shit out of their services, and up selling SW on the back end - essentially double dipping on all business.

FEYE & CRWD are the plays - March/April calls for both past their earnings.  Other cyber companies will ride the wave too, but these two are the main ones to focus on.

Yes - the business model where you only sell games on CDs is obsolete and most probably will be gone the following decade (although it won't die completely imo - look at books and vinyl). But, the play here is the turnaround. I'd just pull this out my ass: gaming hardware, equipments and accessories, consoles once every few years, cybersport involvement, selling merchandise, action figures, collectibles and shit. Not to mention revenue sharing agreement with Microsoft (confirmed) and Sony (rumored). Basically, if the company manages to find a way to stay relevant in any sense, to capture just a teeny-tiny part of this enormous and rapidly growing market - we'd have a 10x bagger on our hands.


The sweetest thing is they are perfectly positioned to make this change - paying back their debts, strong financials (especially so for a retailer during covid). I just can't see how can they go bankrupt for at least a few more years sans something catastrophic happening. I see them being on a right track - closing underperforming & inefficient stores, getting that deal with Microsoft, trying to remake their app and website (they've just recently started offering same-day delivery with DoorDash)

You are judging the company by your anecdotal gaming experience. The thing is, despite all the hate they get from hardcore gamers, they consistently make revenue multiples of their market cap. Most of GME bears I see assume that the company has to be the next hot thing, like Chewy, or Sony, or Steam or smth like Amazon. It does not - it may develop that way, it may not, but just staying afloat and being barely profitable is enough for the stock to rise significantly - check out their revenue and market cap, and compare to their competitors. It is enormously undervalued right now
It‚Äôs the wedgiestttt!!!!

Honestly I think it‚Äôs a quick win that works until it doesn‚Äôt. 

My personal opinion you should research good companies and identify (if you‚Äôre looking at calls) what you think are the positive catalysts for price jumps in the next 12 months (assuming you mostly do LEAPS) keeping in mind the biggest impediment to your gains are the macroeconomic changes out of that companies control and also you doing your DD poorly or just YOLO‚Äôing.

I‚Äôm just some random guy with limited experience <10 years so you know take it with a pinch of salt. 

The biggest gains I made this year were on PLTR and SPCE but I‚Äôve got lots of solid gains on solid companies that have been around for years and years.

Thanks for the info man.

Last question, how reliable is it to buy options at the dip on open then selling right after it profits every day? I've been watching for a while and for almost every stock I watch dumps at 7:30-7:45 at least 3% then skyrockets back up by 8:30. With the right calls could you day trade options for a couple hundred bucks a day, you think?
Yeah. I see it as helping generate revenue to begin with but could also help tamp down on inefficient spending as well which in the long run leads to a series of strains on the economy and defaults.

Like for example building a $1M house is really unesscary unless you're housing 30 people. Lots of labor gets expended, and eventually you need someone to pay taxes and upkeep which the owner gets by working and generating revenue. And that continues to stretch the economic bubble more and more.

With a vat build the $1M house but collect say 5 percent as a insurance fund to protect against a downturn which could affect the workers.
Yah, they are even more upset about trump losing than the dems were about trump winning 4 years ago.

The reason data center hadn't shifted is the lead time and work required to swap everything over.

Most of this doesn't matter.

Interest rate at 0 guarantees equities go up over any reasonable timeframe. Interest will not change until we see inflation. We aren't going to see inflation.

The main risk here is fed being barred from buying more credit bonds and other debt market liquidity actions. If that happens then we definitely see a short term crash as panic happens around risk contraction but it won't be that long lived, see here 0% interest rates.

QE is a very very powerful thing. Even if the economy is in shambles what is left of it will be in equities and they will be going up as the country burns.

Yea, PLTR is on my watchlist. If you want a wedge breakout, I called FCEL on Thursday and have been adding to it. As long as it stays above 9.20, I'll keep adding.

I'm not addicted to fear. Quite the opposite. I'm infected now because I just don't give a fuck and haven't worn a mask in 4 months.

My critical thinking is just fine, which is why I can inductively surmise that trained professionals are probably capable of managing their patients and supplies. Government mandates to shut down didn't cause the shortages, that's when production increases because there is a sudden glut of unemployed people who want to work essential jobs, so that they aren't sitting at the house.

You presented no sources, you applied no logic. Want to try that again?
Why is this asked so often?
How do people derive any information like this from a fucking graph. Literally anything could happen to make this stock go up or down that we don't know about yet.

What a lot of scummy politicians realized is there are millions upon millions of retarded (Hard R), ignorant, gullible, stupid people out there.

AMZN, AAPL, etc. Why is RH not executing that? Or no buyer matches that price spread?
Very valid points. Though, we can likely throw valuations out the window. It‚Äôs not apples to apples, but Tesla‚Äôs valuation is equal to a number of automotive tried and true power houses combined. Valuation doesn‚Äôt apply to growth stocks in the same note as it does to value stocks. Don‚Äôt take it from me though. I‚Äôve only been investing for 2.5 months but I keep up.

I bought mine a week ago. Down 2800. Diamond hands mf we will prevail

Look, I love the initiative (less and less around here) so let me offer a couple unsolicited and uneducated pointers.

First of all, you don't have nearly enough data - trading days or companies - which is why you're getting really weird predictions like Moderna mooning because Ford did. With more data I think you'll find these will all fall away. For starters try 5yrs of data and Russell 1000 stocks. I expect most if not all will fall away.

Which flows into significance. It would be great if the T-stat (or something else) told us **how** good the prediction was. As it stands, us retards are left trying to interpret the stat on our own. Also I don't think a T-stat is relevant for how few observations you have and the fact that equity returns are leptokurtic (fat tails rather than normal dist.)?

It might be interesting to include big price falls as well so that you can inform a short strategy (or if something falls >5% one day maybe something else rises >5% the next day).

Could be interesting/easier to see what cross-sector effects there are. If Healthcare moons/tanks one day does that mean Industrials moons/tanks the next? Upside being you only need to track a few 'stocks' (use indices or sector ETFs) so could do a longer time series. You're using R though so I figure amount of data isn't a problem.

Last suggestion would be on returns and how/whether you include overnight moves. As it stands you're not, but maybe it would be beneficial. If TSLA opens up 20% 'cos Daddy Musk got high and took a literal shit on his neighbor's Volt and then stays flat your equation says it didn't moon but really it did. Just a thought.

Again, good work. Keep going and you might just find something.
right? i'm being kinda aggressive by throwing all my cash in PLTR shares (60k worth w/ a 13.76 average) while being unemployed bumming it at my parents house until the pandemic is over, but at least it's not fucking options. allow yourself a reasonable exit if shit goes bad jesus christ.

They are two separate bills that they intend to merge into one vote. But if one single GOP Senator continues to fuck up the stimulus with his insane Fed demands, they can sign the budget bill on its own.
You‚Äôre fine dude just wait it out or roll out your calls if the first week of Jan comes and they haven‚Äôt recovered. This is part of buying dips, you‚Äôre not gonna buy the absolute bottom. Avg down and be willing to stick around for more than 3 days lmao
Have they? I think that is very much false equivalency. The Dems have been absolutely upfront about what they wanted the entire time. It's been GOP with both the liability shield and the no more printer bullshit that has been attempted to be forced at the last second.

I was down from 30k to 2.5k at one point. I was thinking of giving up on options but decided to yolo it on TSLA calls. Back up to 12k now but I think I can make it back if I play it smart. Although if I held my TSLA calls, they would've been worth over 40k now.

AI and ABNB are my 2 current short term plays.

AI is PLTR but with commercial focus on Fortune 500. They are also way less consulting/professional services focused and have a cloud based platform vs on-prem with big setup.
Expect big growth from AI in the short term as people wake up to what it is they do and it's growth potential vs PLTR.

ABNB is obvious. They have no real competition except regulation and UBER has already shown that public opinion trumps regulation in the long run. Institutional ownership will explode over over next few months.

I don't expect to stay in both forever but both should provide very good 1-2 month gains.

2020. It's a short term play that I'm doing. I don't think the price is stay at 670 but will drop more. Maybe within an hour of open. 2021, well it's gonna look like more of a year for the world to adopt to EV. Canada is commiting, as is the UK.

You're justifying the price based on it's autonomous EV division and not it's suffering massive business called processors? - That's the reason it's going down, because that part is suffering. If we were to price it by their EV shit, then they should be way lower still. Why do you think they should be higher with the way their main business is heading?

Let's say they pivot to sell processors for cars for automated EV. Think they're going to be better than Nvidia?

To me it just seems that there's too much against it and management is just beating the dead horse until they decide to change out management with someone who'd be willing to really prioritize innovation instead of numbers - which are going down.

Not holding my breath for that stimmy.
Still has equities, and we all know that general market ETFs end up holding large portions in the leading companies by market cap. Politicians could just create certain scenarios to benefit the largest equity assets. 

I mean, what if a President signed a bill passed by Congress that increased the loss carry forward provision up to five years so a company like Amazon could continue its exponential growth tax free, thus benefiting the holder of *any* ETF that holds Amazon? Like say the ~300 largest cap ETFs that all hold Amazon and were owned by congresspersons and the president at the time.

Wait, that happened when Amazon was $134 in 2009, when they credit the ability to operate at a loss as the main growth driver.

Nah, you want to be a politician, we‚Äôll pay you like an NFL player but you don‚Äôt get to touch equity on anything you can affect.

Still calling this idea crazy but I‚Äôm just shocked that I can get sanctioned for the ‚Äúappearance of impropriety‚Äù for my work when these jabroni‚Äôs can just make a winning market for the underlying assets in whatever they hold. It‚Äôs just self service with a middleman right now.

I‚Äôm not great looking myself but a lot of the people I see on hinge I don‚Äôt find attractive (while I get that seems shallow af I have nothing else to go on at that moment in time) 

Being able to comment on pictures and stuff is a great idea - so many times I‚Äôve seen a girl be into music or hobbies I am and felt being able to bond over something is better than relying on a pickup line.

Trading and investing are 2 different things. I do a bit of both. I have long term holds like AMD, AAPL, MSFT, BABA, JD, GOOG that I think are going to be 50-100% gain companies every year for the next 10 years.

Then I trade a bit, options plays on stocks I know have nearterm catalysts that should force the price up.

I played the TSLA run up and exited yesterday. I am currently in AI and ABNB short term too. I might graduate some of these trades into investments (like ABNB) but for the most part I use about 30% of my capital to try make short term returns and have 70% of my capital invested for long term returns.

IMO Stimmy. QE is basically just the ability for lenders to borrow for free it is no way obligates them to take risks with lending out that money. Stimmy is just pure liquid injected straight to the public. Yes, a lot of people will just save it but many will immediately put it right back into the economy/market.

For a lot of reasons. Imagine you work there, have a young family, and make $120k per year. You‚Äôre sitting on $5 million of options you haven‚Äôt been able to sell. What are the odds you want to sell some of it to move your family into a nicer house and out of your tiny Palo Alto apartment? Or put a million of it into Amazon shares so you have some safe diversity and don‚Äôt have your fortunes tied to any one firm.

Why is this important? Well, when senators aren't punished financially for their retardation, they have no reason to not be retarded.

In March when they were losing 5-10% of their life savings every day, they had a multitrillion dollar stimulus passed within hours.

I guarantee you, a single circuit breaker would get this stimulus passed in record timing.

From Michael Lewis‚Äô ‚ÄúLiar‚Äôs Poker:‚Äù

‚ÄúThey had to guess which direction the American bond market would take: up or down.  The systems usually involved staring for hours at charts showing the history of bond prices.  As in Rorschach ink blots, an unlikely formation, such as a human head and shoulders, made itself privately known to the viewer.  The chartist - for that is what such a person called himself - would then use his ruler and pencil to draw the future of bond prices based on the assumption that the historical pattern could be projected forward.  Miraculously, in a bull market, the resulting forecast was that the market was going up.  Actually there was one good reason for using the charts: Everyone else did.  If you believed that large sums of money were about to be invested on the basis of a chart, then, as dumb as it made you feel, it made sense to look at that chart; perhaps it would enable you to place your bet first and get in front of the coming wave.‚Äù

In other words, PLTR 1/8/21 30C
Can't happen. We're gonna use aliases and VPNs. Can't go tits up.
You‚Äôre still up though that‚Äôs what matters :)  
I think with options it should really just be a supplemental play if you already hold the stock and remain bullish/continuing the trend. I‚Äôd say limiting them to 5-10% max of account value would be the best bet though.

Back in the mid-2000s I had a brief internship working for an ex state governor of a large and important state in the Midwest. I was blown away by how easy his job was. He literally just sat at his desk all day and made phone calls to other politicians who were still in office and shot the shit with them, then he'd tell them he had this great idea of an addition to a bill, or tell them they needed to remove something, and shoot a little more shit. Then after 10 minutes he'd hang up the phone, look at me, and say something like, "I think we'll charge the client $20,000 for that one."

Tough life for those guys.

I'm looking at their financials, they do under 1b rev per quarter... amazon does about 100 times that.

3P makes up roughly half of amazon sales so it's not possible for those figures to be true.

Best recently example is TSLA close on Friday. Funds only managed to buy up half of what they needed by close so in the last 30s they had to dump order for ~$60B in stock on the market thus shooting the price to 695 that a lot of people had put as limit sell.

This is simply supply and demand. When the amount of people willing to sell for less than X reaches zero, X must increase until sellers are found. This is normally counter balanced a bit in the market by short sellers which provide liquidity at X by betting price will go below X.

However if enough people are trying to bet the price will go below X and it doesn't then the supply (available float) reduces as more people go short. At some point you reach where GME is where almost 100% of the float is short.

Now shorts lose money when price is below their sell price, they also are borrowing these shares so they lose money the longer they maintain their position too. If the stock price goes up too much they would owe their broker too much money and they would want to exit to cut their losses on the trade. They do this by covering their position, i.e buying shares equal to the shares they were short.
Because they borrowed the shares on margin they lose the difference between their sell price and the eventual buy price (or make money if the short is successful).

While there is still a little bit of available liquidity the price is kept manageable but if at anytime something was to happen that increased appetite for buying and no more short sellers to provide that liquidity then the price has to be forced higher.
The higher the price is forced the deeper red the shorts go.
At some point a big short will either need to exit to cut losses or they will get margin called, either one happening triggers the same thing which is them needing to buy shares to cover their position with very little available liquidity and from holders that don't want to sell. i.e price goes a lot higher.
This causes a chain reaction of stop-loss, margin call and risk management algos to all try exit the short positions. These -must- exist because potential loss on short positions is infinite.

So it's basically like dominos, if GME gang successfully breaks one big short the whole thing will come tumbling down and the price will rocket upwards for a very short period of time as all the shorts blow up.

It's called an infinity squeeze because there is technically no limit on how high the price can go.
compared to which countries exactly? we're right on par with shitholes like Brazil and Syria in terms of mask wearing.

Basically.

>It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen...

[u/Henkss](https://www.reddit.com/user/Henkss/), that's a fairly good approximation of exactly what the market does and one of the many reasons growth/tech trades like long-duration instruments.

**It comes with extremely high risks.** Any change in rates or yield curve, credit-worthiness, forecast revisions, extra competitors, raw material/labor price change, geopolitical event, GLOBAL SUPPLY-CHAIN-DISRUPTING PANDEMIC STATUS, etc. has the risk of changing expectations for 5-10 years out---upside and downside risk.

From a fundamental perspective, investors/gamblers taking that kind of risk should have extremely high expectations. It just so happens TSLA has rewarded us a lot of the time. Many companies do not reward.

It reminds me when Tom Leighton's company Akamai went public in the late 90s. AKAM was the next big thing for the internet. Stock price fucking flew and AKAM was doing brilliant things, but what happens to even an innovative company like that when every fly-by-night dot.com was going under and panicked money and leverage was exiting the market?

Also, fundamental considerations completely ignore psychological and technical reasons TSLA is where it is. My three cents.

I suspect you don‚Äôt know the difference between growth and profits
I can't confirm itll happen, but let's take a look at some estimated data provided by iborrow. On 12-14 the shares available to borrow went ALL the way down to 30-40k. Since then shorts have been covering their positions, and buying back. On 12-14 the SP was sitting at near $12-$13, as shorts continue to release their positions back as reflected recently on iBorrow, back to ~900,000 share available to short. That creates an increase in demand both naturally from retail regaining confidence in GME making purchases, AND from the shorts covering, creating a feedback loop. Thus raising the SP. Keep in mind (as of last official report) GME short/float available was 67m/56m. The feed backloop exists, and its just going to take one major positive catalyst to set it all off, in my opinion.
That‚Äôs crazy. TSLA is worth at least $30

Yeah you're probably correct. But this is actually much worse than gamblers fallacy. Stocks move in trends. So each day is not random like in roulette. The probability of green when the previous sessions were green is not lower. It's higher. At least in roulette your odds are always 50%. Your odds of success when short in a bull market are much less than 50%.

Idk, it kinda makes sense though right, like from a game theory stand point lots of little investors are much more likely to sell than two massive firms and vica versa, two large firms are much more likely to hold off than lots of smaller shorts, because, similarly, they are more worried about the others buckling, further worsening their positions

Change my mind.
Stick to shares if you can brotha. rich people own shares not poor people. There is a reason. This is coming from someone who is doing options. They are pretty much a gamble. But you could definitely try again with 10-20k on rite aid or ebay and see if you hit 100 and then throw that on a nice long term stock like ford or funko.

Here are my other assumptions,  I assume three periods of linear enrollment from 24Sep to 27Oct (0 to 5500), 28Oct to 09Nov (5501 to 9000), 10Nov to 27Nov (9001 to 15000).  Also I ranged UK infection rate as Oct21-Nov18 as 14.5K/65M per day, Nov19 - Dec 15 as 22K/65M perday and Dec16 onwards 18k/65M.

Was not expecting to come to WSB to read this but how does it feel? Like did that event change you? Do you still feel the same or do you think about it once in a while?
Trump lost dude, get over it.
I dont know what im reading but it looks like 2k shares. If so, just set it and forget it my man. Im bearish on almost everything but BB. If this sub is right and tsla is the future, all these cars are going to need to be hack proof. BB has been known as strong on security for 2 decades. That is starting to materialize. Wait until every amzn delivery vehicle runs BB software. Wait until tslas start getting hacked and they realize they need a more secure platform. BB time will come. Long and strong.
Thank you, /u/TheAmazingButtPlug

For the first time during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend, Shopify sales surpassed Amazon‚Äôs Third-Party Seller business.

[source](https://ark-invest.com/newsletters/issue-251/?utm_content=149630328&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-2398137084)

Perhaps more important is another metric. Shopify‚Äôs Shop app, a consumer mobile application for shopping and tracking packages, climbed the US App Store download ranks at an accelerated rate during the busiest shopping weeks of the year. On December 1, it broke into the top 10 of downloaded apps across all categories, ranking just behind the Amazon app. On December 1, Shop also ranked first across the App store in the UK and since then has ranked #2 compared to #15 at Amazon. In the Canadian App Store, Shop also has overtaken Amazon this season.

Bro please be careful with taxes. I see this is mostly gains from other weekly yolos. If you keep winning until the 31st but then lose it after the new year, you are still on the hook for any and all gains made during 2020. Before the 31st pull out whatever you expect to pay in taxes otherwise uncle sam is going to come and break your knee caps for the tens of thousands you owe them that you subsequently could lose
These big shorts aren't gonna get "margin called".  Not on a billion dollar market cap stock.  BoA is good for it.

Republicans in the senate have played this so fucking well.  They said fuck you to trillions in stimulus.  Now they are less than a trillion and still manhandling democrats.

Why the fuck is Congress stuck on the role of the Federal Reserve in the negotiations for the stimulus? Like holy fuck, who gives a shit?  The Fed has done a good job already keeping the economy from blowing up. Why is there the need to stall the stimulus?  It should have easily passed months ago.

Can bloody Toomey put his idea into next deal please.. what a shit
To defeat Kleptocracy, it is a key starting point.  Great work.  Kleptocracy is the number 1 enemy of society.  Identifying the ways to defeat it are critical.  Introducing a bill to nullify the Sarbanes Oxley Act, and the ITIL management system, and elected officials sitting on commercial boards must follow.  Introducing a four-tier accounting system, completely transparent is also needed.  As is a new type of stock system, a new banking system, again, all accountable to a four-tier accounting system allowing local, state, federal and global transparency. No more money laundering means no more Kleptocracy.

So basically we‚Äôre in 1929
I agree. 
Do you know Intel last year revenue was 70billion, and AMD only less than 10billion. The total market is growing by few % each year, estimated >8% in 2021. Imagine AMD only captures 50% of market share in say 3 years, it will be 200 a billion company. Long term bullish on AMD!

I think if you look at Tesla‚Äôs revenue growth and their projected revenue growth there is a path to far surpass Amazon‚Äôs revenue.  That being said there are countless serious execution challenges and market conditions that could hamper this.  However if you believe they can even do half of what they say they can then their revenue in 5-10 years will be astronomical.  They also seem to be improving profit margins as they go.
Even if this gets passed, there's a million ways around it. Would just be a useless politically driven piece of regulation.

https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/agreement-between

Ya don't say...

Congress agrees to them, but the courts uphold and amend them. You said this yourself providing an example that an oil company could sue if a country decides not to use their special blend of herbs and spices. When the courts either uphold a part of the trade agreement or deny it, they amend it. It sets case law in place that provides precedent for future proceedings.

Corporations can throw out a wish list, which is exactly what that draft from 2015 is, but they don't decide what makes it into the final deal. They never will, because corps would choke out governments and give them no tax revenue if they got what they wanted and completely destroy diplomacy in the process, and it's the diplomats who push the trade deals through.

https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/tpp-full-text

> Likely to run many hundreds of pages, the package is not only expected to carry the $900 billion covid relief deal but also $1.4 trillion in year-long appropriations for federal agencies; the extension of tens of billions of dollars in expiring tax breaks; a bipartisan energy bill; a long-delayed bipartisan solution to surprise medical billing; and dozens of other potential add-ons that a vast corps of lobbyists and congressional aides are hoping to include in this last legislative vehicle of 2020.

This is going to be down voted because retards prefer to hear that Stimmy was passed than the harsh reality:

It has not passed, nor will it with current legislation.

Toomey's provision is the main reason why Stimmy has not been passed. It will strip the Fed's ability to give out loans/QE. You know, The Printer we all worship. Yes, the Republicans want to turn the printer off.

Why? Well now all of a sudden Republicans are worrying about spending. Big surprise with a Democrat coming to the oval office. However, this is a set up, as the potential for another big market drop still lies out there. Without the printer, we're fucked if that happens. I mean like FUCKED as in your parents leaving you alone with the weird uncle for a week.

I'd rather this stimmy fail and a new one without that language drafted after Georgia run off than take this Stimmy that comes with a ticking time bomb

I‚Äôm not saying it will happen, but it seems plausible that it could. It really only takes what I mentioned. Adoption in South America and India like it is here and becoming ALREADY in Europe and they‚Äôre there.

If you were that confident you wouldn't be begging to the stock gods to help you out of your hole. "I need it to"
Agreed. The whole market is in a massive uptrend. All bearish plays are playing with fire now even on garbage stocks like SNOW and DASH.

Crazy idea: substantially increase the cash salary of congress persons but bar them from holding any investments besides bond funds or fixed rate investments. Have to sell your shit before hand. Yeah you‚Äôre locked into some 3% rate that pretty much can only match inflation, but here‚Äôs 400k. No you don‚Äôt even get general index funds, since we know they‚Äôre all super weighted towards FAANGM and you‚Äôd just benefit those with your policy choices.

I don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôd do with people that are self employed though, because I‚Äôve thought about this for about 2 minutes.

Edit: spouses and kids dump their stuff too.

they have over 1 million employees: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amzn

their profit margins are sitting at only 4-6%: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/profit-margins

a lot of is due to costs related to low-skill labour in their warehouses, and delivering products. with AI, and robotics taking off, a lot of that labour will be replaced

they're well aware of this and investing heavily in this: 

- https://aws.amazon.com/automotive/autonomous-driving/  
- https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/12/14/amazon-owned-self-driving-taxi-zoox-reveals-its-secret-vehicle/  
- https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs  

electric vehicles are also far less expensive to maintain, and battery tech will improve exponentially over time

their margins will thicken to maybe 30 to 40%, which will result in much higher EPS numbers, and the stock will skyrocket

the company has limitless potential with the extra free cash flow

It was just closing the gap from the previous run up and rejection. Calm your tits.
oh for sure. i dont think that TSLAs industry is anywhere close to important as AMZNs... It was much much easier for me to pour my money in AMZN shares because I knew first hand how powerful they were going to be. 

it was more an example of how P/E doesnt tell the full story of a stock. that being said i dont expect anyone to invest in TSLA. ill continue buying LEAPs until it stops working, but for now its been free money and much appreciated lol
If there is no stimulus I would not be surprised if CNBC just says ‚Äúmarket rises on Santa Claus rally optimism . Its really that ridiculous now

You misunderstood. WE can't lose on Amazon.

YOU can.

Get someone‚Äôs piss that‚Äôs clean, and freeze some for a later date if needed. Microwave it to about 100 degrees f before leaving your house and put a heat warmer around the vial. Strap to crotch. Then go into the bathroom and pour into cup, measure temp. As long as it‚Äôs about 95-98 or so you should be good.

Done this 3 times in my life, worked every time. Also don‚Äôt use a woman‚Äôs piss if you‚Äôre a guy. Ask your dad or anyone you know for some. Worst case get synthetic piss from a weed shop but real is better.

How do you go negative unless your option spread value have discrepancies that don't actually matter, you just have to wait for them to readjust the next day. This happens with low volume options. Robinhood also dont let people do risky plays that exceed their net worth. Are you trying to scam people?
It‚Äôs just a convention in finance. SP500 represents the whole market. So you always compare the gains with those of SP500 even if the stock is not in it.

Correction - He bought the hospitals out of bankruptcy proceedings so he could not have "declared" the hospitals bankrupt. The hospitals had already been declared bankrupt by a bankruptcy court. 

I thought it was pretty obvious that 99% of the customer base would be from New Jersey counties given the fact that he owned 3 hospitals in New Jersey.

The real fraud is the mis-aligned incentives that the government sets for health care providers to profit without providing any value to customers. At least this guy has the balls to do something about it.

Technically they have been growing about 30% annually. I don‚Äôt think they can keep that up, but if they did, that would mean they‚Äôd be worth $570,000+ a share in 20 years. 

And if they can maintain an average of 25% growth, they also get to over $260,000 share. 

Granted, I don‚Äôt know if they can continue to grow like they are, not without conquering India and South America. Both which could happen. China would of been the golden goose, but they kinda fucked that football.

‚ÄúIn this study, we estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths resulting from the potential disruption of health systems and decreased access to food.‚Äù

‚Äúboth directly and indirectly, is likely to be much higher‚Äù

‚ÄúEvaluating unexplained increases in deaths due to all causes or attributed to nonspecific outcomes, such as pneumonia and influenza, can provide a more complete picture of the burden of COVID-19‚Äù

Thanks for the sources bud. And that‚Äôs my point exactly. The viral infection isn‚Äôt killing most of these people but the secondary effects due to the lack of access to critical health services such as surgeries, chemo etc. 

The virus is over hyped. When I say death rate due to COVID I mean due to a direct viral infection. Not due to the effects of corona on public health services. 

Combine this with the CDC guidance, Medicare incentive, pcr tests that are likely over cycles to produce positive results all of this is fishy to say the least.

Completely untrue. Boomers don‚Äôt know shit about fair pricing for most electronics, if you want to act like boomers are some savvy generation of shoppers (LMAO) then feel free to tell me why our most consistent selling accessory in HT are 40$ HDMI cables. Certainly it‚Äôs not because these boomers compare prices and realize they can get the exact same cable for 7$ from Monoprice or ~15 from any other retailer. Half of them have never even heard of a streaming service and are still fine dropping 90$ on cable, so don‚Äôt talk to me about boomers comparing prices lol
I‚Äôm no expert, man. I bought early, so I feel no real pressure to sell atm. 40 is still a hard support. If it goes past that, selling a portion might be a good idea.

They get one contract to work with Microsoft, probably collecting their ball sweat, and people think that they are going to moon? I‚Äôm sorry but if you see something say something.

But to think Microsoft is just going to be giving a significant part of their Xbox sells to game stop for ‚Äú reasons‚Äù makes be highly doubt that it will be enough to save the company. The little bone they are being thrown is probably going to just be getting payed to basically advertise for them.  That or they are going to get a small cut of any ‚Äúgame stop exclusive‚Äù Digital cosmetic items that you buy, even if it‚Äôs bought through the Xbox store. Not that this is bad for the company, and it may keep them afloat but they are having to scale down massively because they where failing for years.

Congratulations. Bulls always get rewarded to tendie town. Have fun!
This is the dumbest take ever. IPOs dont cost money - they net millions to billions of dollars for the company going IPO depending on the size of it.

If a company is short on cash to pay marginal fees associated with the IPO it's nonsensical to think that would prevent the IPO, dude. First off, the banks underwriting it get paid immediately via selling parts of their stakes. Second, if the company did somehow owe money, it would be able to immediately meet that debt obligation via the warchest obtained as a result of the IPO.

Have you ever been through an IPO? I have and we certainly had no cash, we were in debt. The whole point of the IPO is to generate immediate cash. Same goes for a secondary.

But looking back, I realize this is WSB and not an actual finance sub, so you are forgiven.

Do that to bro, fuck it I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm just down to support my bro‚Äôs man. Depression is very real and even though this is an echo chamber, there are some people that are really going through it.
It's a longshot, but I anticipate that retail investors and institutional algos will become increasingly focused on biotech as there is an endless swathe of "return to normal" coverage, related to MRNA and PFE vaccines. 

Since a large majority of people will likely be getting this vaccine over the next 6 months, there will likely be an increased awareness of the potential for genetics. Even though these vaccines are only mRNA, it's different enough to open up a few laypeople's eyes to this field (even if it's just 1% of those who get vaccinated).

Also, ARKG is finishing a 14d period of consolidation right under the $100 price mark. Although I'm not one for TA, but if it convincingly cracks through this barrier, it can become a psychological support which protects my downside. ARKW did something similar back in Aug/Sept.

I've been meaning to roll my $80s for a week or two now.

I don't have any real strategy behind it, *other* than to wait for a red day and do it, because the ITM calls will lose less value than the slightly OOTM calls.

I meant to roll these to $90s, and then it went and blew right through $90 as well, so I'll roll them to $100 or $110, since I already have a pile of $100s.

If they were closer to LTCG I might hold them.  But, it's not worth waiting for that, when I'll more than overcome the tax difference by moving up strikes, because I'm also rolling profits.

Something I don't see people ever mention is local governments and municipalities will likely try to block widespread autonomous driving. They derive a huge amount of their income from traffic violations. Everything from speeding, turning right on a red, to DUI. The amount of income they will permanently lose when cars are autonomous will be staggering. They actually have an incentive to block it; after all we know most of these laws are not about "safety," they're about collecting revenue.
I still sense anger from a gain, that‚Äôs what makes no sense. Especially since it‚Äôs not ur play but what ever

When do you roll your leaps typically? I ask cause I've got some deep itm leaps from 50-90 on AMD but I figured I'd at least hold them till I get long term gains before rolling? Do you take that into account or just roll when the delta get above like .85 or something?

There isn't any.  Because they can't understand some very fundamental things about the distribution of holders.  There's no "math" behind any of it.

VW had two longs locking up 96%+ of the float against a large number of small shorts.  12 to 1 short to float ratio.

GME has a concentrated short position (BoA, Melvin) against a large number of longs.  1 to 1 short to float ratio.

It will never squeeze like VW.  Not possible.

These idiots look at a large SI percentage and that's the only thing they're basing this thesis on.
It was like 126 I think because my 110 hit my sell limit and I bought the 120 and some arkk shares. And not down by much like 200 right now.

If it keeps up this trend, more conservative target is \~417 which is where the middle of the channel trendline will be on that date. (SPY is currently finding resistance at this trendline). Ideal entry would be for it to back test the bottom of the channel trendline, but that's \~350 level and I'm not sure with all this stimmy news, etc. it'll get down there.

I don't see it either tbh.

All the MMs and brokers need to do is recognize that a short squeeze will only be temporary, and allow the short sellers to stay on margin so they're not forced into the squeeze feedback loop.

More conservative target is 417 which is the middle of the channel trendline that it's currently finding resistance on. I'm going to switch to puts cuz I'm expecting a correction if it gets there. Of course, this is IF it gets there and how the price reacts from there. Who knows? I may not get an entry for puts and end up getting more calls lol
My 3K Bengal cat is in my profile picture with me. Only üòº that deserves my money.
At open on Monday I intend to 

1) YOLO $100k into 7/16 ARKG $80c (current price $21)  
2) Write a diagonal spread for 4/16 ARKG $125c (current price $3)

This should give me potential for up to **115% gains by April on ARKG**, while limiting my likely losses to about 40% if spot price retreats to $80 on 4/16.

Short selling happens on margin. Someone (a broker) needs to 'lend' you shares to sell them at the current price which you will pay for at some future, hopefully lower price.

Since you sold them shares you haven't paid for yet, you're borrowing to do it, and the juice is running.

I would have to ask where you are getting your information on how trade deals work? None of what you said if correct outside of the leak being a rough draft as technically it has not been put into place.  With zero hyperbole nobody knows what is in the trade deals thanks to Fast Track Trade Authority given to the executive branch.They are 100% sealed for 4 years; this applies to courts and legislators (in the US) only the president can negotiate international agreements that Congress can either approve or deny but cannot amend or filibuster.  This eliminates the whole period where congress actually discusses the provisions in the agreement. With FTA there is no debate... he level of secrecy surrounding these negotiations means that ordinary people across Europe and most of the national members of parliament have no idea what‚Äôs going on. Just look at the TTIP, The European Commission placed a 30 year ban on all public access to the key documents behind TTIP right at the beginning of the negotiations. Any members of the European Parliament who are given access to the special reading rooms where they can see some of the documents they have to sign documents promising that they will not share any of what they‚Äôve seen outside that room. Really, it‚Äôs like a scene from the Stalinist Soviet past, where you have individual documents marked with secret markings, so that they can trace the source of any leaks when the documents do go out into the public domain. It‚Äôs profoundly un-transparent and anti-democratic... Frankly speaking if you don't have FUD from heads of multi national corporations writing trade deals in secret and then passing them without anyone being able to know what is in them you should look to history.

My husband works in the field as a high level analyst and has taken a look at what happened. This is on a whole other level. He describes it as a big "fuck you".

And yes people typically don't want to say they were hacked. Or the extreme level that they wee hacked due to bringing down their company's stocks. That's why FireEye initially put out that their "red team tools" were stolen instead of what actually happened.

By the way my husband worked for FireEye a couple years ago before leaving that horrible culture.

Intel have now imho lesser cpu. But also AMD is in gpu market. 

And apple has now arm M1 and Qualcomm has windows arm snapdragons.

Age of x86 might be over. That fucks intel hard but AMD stays in the game.

This might not be short term perspective. More like a long term. Still tones of software runs on x86 and porting some things will be a massive cost.

But yeah imho AMD is much better positioned in the market.

I just bought ryzen 3950 moving from 4770k i7 and ofc more power and comparison of not possible but...

The box it ships in, fuck AMD gave me apple treatment with box and led cpu cooler while intel have same toilet paper boxes with coolers made out of foam.

That is some truly idiotic confirmation bias. Boomers are going to go to f****** Walmart where the same HDMI cable is like $5 cheaper. also anything that you can get in a Best Buy you can get in the electronics department of a Target or walmart. F****** believe me I worked at this goddamn company on a store level and then a corporate level. You don't know what the f*** you're talking about

Edit, I guess you can get appliances at Best Buy, but boomers, again, are going to go to places like Home Depot or Lowe's where they can get them cheaper.

A congressman or congresswoman should really be payed less of a salary than they do now, only be allowed to invest in passive index funds, lobbying to politicians is illegal, and term limits.

People who get into politics should be doing it to help the people of the country, not to make it a career and get rich. Then, I think we would get better people doing the job. Who actually do it for the betterment of the country. If there is no way you get rich off of it.

Meh. In the dot-com bubble maybe. But the current bubble is driven in large part by both suppression of interest rates and the Fed/Congress essentially promising to backstop the entire private sector such that no significant number of large private companies will ever go bankrupt again. When the risk-free rate of return is effectively 0 (or negative) and the downside risk of equities is capped by the inevitability of taxpayer-funded bailouts, any business with the possibility of generating future returns on invested capital will end up having a market cap of ‚ôæ. We have long been aware that systemic mis-pricing of risk causes a melt-up in asset prices. Ask Japan how that ends.

The party in opposition always wants to rein in the spending of the party in power. The last faction that actually wanted to rein in spending were the Gingrich republicans in the 90's. And clinton destroyed them along with the real economy forever, if not for a few generations. Why? I'll let you figure that one out on your own.

Sell puts
ur taking huge over weekend assignment risk ... very very bad idea
Theta gang son. Selling options on shares I already own. So let's say I have 3,300 shares of PLTR. That allows me to write 33 option contracts. 

So just looking at pltr right now I can write $28 12/31 contracts for $119 each. $119 x 33 = $3,927. So even if I write contracts and this low price I still make basically 2k a week guaranteed.

But keep in mind PLTR crashed yesterday so I have no open contracts right now. I normally wait until the morning moon to write my contracts, so I expect to sell the same exact play for around 6k on Monday morning. The worst that can happen is that the contract closes ITM and my shares get called away. Which is still fine because I get to keep the 6k and I sell the 3300 shares at a profit. So there's basically no downside right now on this play for me.
Yeah, I got in at the start of the month hoping that vaccine news would pop it but apparently not.

Ah well now that you mentioned that you lost 600k I'm sure this will work out. Hope to see more of you here.
Someone posted a senate trade app on here not too long ago that showed what they traded and how much.

I'm on board with you 100% We are the power! We controll the markets. WSB is a super powerful tool to make stock go up or down, because we know and believe in actual truth about the company. And JPM and CS can fuck themselves. Bunch of crooks!!! 

If us, like a 1,000 guys here (most of us have a very substantial accounts) could crate a joint group chat and buy or sell at the same time (coordinate trades via live chat) - we would be able to do a lot.

Any thoughts?

Has anyone thought about it? 

Suggestions?

PS we would have to focus on a few stocks to keep everything simple and to make it work.

No One is buying 1500 phones when they‚Äôre all unemployed, China kicked them out of their market, and India workers just trashed and looted their factory.  People not thinking Apple has troubles ahead regardless of their cash reserves just aren‚Äôt paying attention

While I agree that we should be correct in our criticisms, it should also be reiterated, that the reason they don't care about giving themselves raises is because they make most of their money from backroom deals and their obviously conflict-of-interest stocks.
You retards do know you can sell CSPs and make a premium before you go long like some of yall have to do after buying at the top?
Not sure why people keep saying this. Krzanich was an OG Intel engineer and is responsible for the company missing out on early mobile platform development. He also oversaw the 10nm debacle that‚Äôs still sort of unraveling. The CEOs before him were basically the founders who oversaw the company during when they were effectively a monopoly. Intel has a lot of issues right now and while they‚Äôre not totally sunk I think it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre taking in water. Putting an engineer at the helm and ‚Äújust start innovating again‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to bail them out
Good luck bro. At 29 over you‚Äôre lucky you didn‚Äôt pick up a reckless driving charge.

‚ÄúTo address potential Medicare program integrity risks, effective with admissions occurring on or after September 1, 2020, claims eligible for the 20 percent increase in the MS-DRG weighting factor will also be required to have a positive COVID-19 laboratory test documented in the patient‚Äôs medical record. Positive tests must be demonstrated using only the results of viral testing (i.e., molecular or antigen), consistent with CDC guidelines. The test may be performed either during the hospital admission or prior to the hospital admission.‚Äù

More money for hospitals if the test comes in positive. 

Now look into PCR tests and how cycles over 30 can give an enormous amount of false positives. 

Where there‚Äôs financial incentive and you can scam people hiding behind science and professional lingo not known by the populace. Then yes a scam can easily happen.

If only the CDC would stop giving such guidance maybe the COVID ‚Äúdeath rate‚Äù would be lower:

‚ÄúIn cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID‚Äì19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID‚Äì19 on a death certificate as ‚Äúprobable‚Äù or ‚Äúpresumed.‚Äù In these instances, certifiers should use their best clinical judgement in determining if a COVID‚Äì19 infection was likely. However, please note that testing for COVID‚Äì19 should be conducted whenever possible.‚Äù

It happens way more frequently than people think. However, most of the breaches will go unreported because no one wants to admit that they got hacked.

the fuck are you talking about lmao
1) If you buy on xbox bought in store - GameStop gets a cut. As for the products - yes you can buy them on Amazon, so what? Following your logic Chewy, BestBuy, and tons of other retailers should close right now, not just GameStop

2) I sense a lot of emotions in here. Remember as the time goes by more and more kids grow up, start working (=earning money to spend), and they don't have same negative emotional attachment that you have when GameStop robbed you with your game collection 10 years ago. Your second point is entirely based on your desire to get revenge on a company that you perceive has wronged you in the past. Look past it and on actual state of the company

Maybe half
thats what I thought too but the new F150 is bigger, beefier, stronger, more luxurious, more power, more torque, more storage, etc....and oh ya, it's the #1 selling vehicle in the US, every year for many, many, many years. Im betting the E- F150 will put the gas version out of biz pretty quick as they will retail for the same price.  Im not sure about the US but pretty much the rest of the industrialized world is keeping their gas cars but will never ever buy one again. Their next cars are hybrid or full electric. Im betting this move turns ford around on a dime when the f150 becomes the worlds #1 selling electric vehicle by an order of magnitude. I think the cyber whatever truck from tesla falls very, very flat 1-2 years out. Ford seems to be taking on this new market very quietly with offerings in each category. the 1.3million or so Teslas puts out per year will be dwarfed by ford's 40 models and the 5 million units per year over the next years. Self driving is also a very, very long way away from mass adoption but EVs are now.
If you're that unsure then it's gonna go wrong 100%

Personally know of many that have passed on. Yet many deaths still remain uncounted as that only occurs under hospitalized medical supervision. The greater percentage dont make it to the hospital, are never admitted or simply passed alone. Some municipalities still deny its existance, have numbers surpressed or shame those that bring attention.

There isn't really such thing as environmentally friendly plastics unfortunately. Even the biodegradable polymers last for too long so still end up doing a ton of damage to marine environments etc.

Reusability helps but only if people reuse. For that it makes sense to actually not use plastic at all but other affordable and environmentally sound options like hemp and other natural fibers. These create incredibly strong bags for carrying items etc.

The place plastic is hard to replace currently is in holding liquids and food stuffs. Plastic is easier to ensure sanitation, paper with coatings can be used but a lot of those coatings are as bad as the plastics they are replacing. So that is a hard problem to solve.
History is kind of just sitting there calling you a liar though, so I think I'm going to go with History. Has a better track record of being right.

In a couple weeks their float will jump when the PIPE shares are sold.
It‚Äôs means this... my wife knows I‚Äôm financially responsible and I‚Äôm not a retard. If I decide I‚Äôm going to surprise her with a car she *would* be able to cope with it (unlike your partner) because she knows I‚Äôm not going to make a stupid decision to the tune of $35k. I don‚Äôt need to get her permission (or as you put it, be transparent) because she trusts my ability to make decisions for our family. 

Buying a car without telling her is a drop in the bucket. A month ago I made the decision to buy a 3.7mm building for my business that will be held in our trust without much input from her. Sure, we discussed buying a building leading up to it... it‚Äôs been something that‚Äôs been on the table for years actually, but I didn‚Äôt feel the need to call her and run it by her before I made the offer or before I wired the deposit to start escrow. Different strokes for different folks. I have a track record of making good decisions, and frankly she doesn‚Äôt really give a shit. In fact, we‚Äôve been in escrow for about 45 days and she just saw the building for the first time a few days ago.

\>What's odd is that I read that Intel still owns something like 70% of the CPU space in all sectors, yet their market cap isn't THAT much larger

Market caps are based on future earnings potential which is why they trade at a multiple. Intel is in decline so their multiple is tiny. If anything AMD can more than double at this point.

‚ÄúTo address potential Medicare program integrity risks, effective with admissions occurring on or after September 1, 2020, claims eligible for the 20 percent increase in the MS-DRG weighting factor will also be required to have a positive COVID-19 laboratory test documented in the patient‚Äôs medical record. Positive tests must be demonstrated using only the results of viral testing (i.e., molecular or antigen), consistent with CDC guidelines. The test may be performed either during the hospital admission or prior to the hospital admission.‚Äù

More money for hospitals if the test comes in positive. 

Now look into PCR tests and how cycles over 30 can give an enormous amount of false positives. 

Where there‚Äôs financial incentive and you can scam people hiding behind science and professional lingo not known by the populace. Then yes a scam can easily happen.

Numbers aren't hard.
The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human¬†carcinogenicity.[25]¬†Organizations such as the Joint¬†FAO/WHO¬†Meeting on Pesticide Residues and the¬†European Commission, Canadian¬†Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the German¬†Federal Institute for Risk Assessment[26]¬†have concluded that there is no evidence that glyphosate poses a carcinogenic or¬†genotoxic¬†risk to humans. The final assessment of the¬†Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority¬†in 2017 was that "glyphosate does not pose a carcinogenic risk to humans".[27]¬†The EPA has evaluated the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate multiple times since 1986. In 1986, glyphosate was initially classified as Group C: "Possible Human Carcinogen", but later recommended as Group D: "Not Classifiable as to Human Carcinogenicity" due to lack of¬†statistical significance¬†in previously examined rat tumor studies. In 1991, it was classified as Group E: "Evidence of Non-Carcinogenicity for Humans", and in 2015 and 2017, "Not Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans".[28][29]


From wikipedia. It's literally consensus that proper use does not cause cancer.


Even if it *did* cause cancer, the regulatory bodies allowing the use of roundup should mean that Monsanto (and BAYER) is not responsible anymore. That's what regulstions are also for, go make sure that you aren't liable when you complied with the regulation.

Maybe by retards. Paper bags are carbon capture. Plant trees, trees soak up CO2. Cut down tree and turn into lumber, take recycled lumber + waste and turn into paper. Paper then biodegrades sinking the carbon into the ground again.

Paper bags are really good in general and I wish they were more common place.

Things are turning around here in Thailand. Covid has started to force elimination of single use plastics which are mostly being replaced with paper thankfully.

The government hires PLTR because they have the best A.I. in the business.

Yep. I've consolidated multiple trading accounts into Merrill this month and not all the shares are reflected on that one screen. They are reflected on my account summary screen below. I asked Merrill why and they said to just go with the account summary total, that display issues happen with consolidated accounts.

Yeah, the short squeeze everyone is in for hasn't happened yet. April because that'll be after the earnings call that includes the console launch sales and the holiday spending. And as far as how high, it's hard to say. I do expect it to at least double before everything is said and done.

You‚Äôre an idiot, glyphosate, the main ingredient in roundup has been linked to cancer and increased chance of cancer by numerous studies. That‚Äôs why they lost the court case. The judge upheld the juries decision, meaning the judge also sided with the farmers. At the time Monsanto wasn‚Äôt a foreign company, that only happened recently when Bayer acquired Monsanto and rebranded them as such. 

Roundup did not decrease the amount of pesticides being used, Monsanto‚Äôs control over farming forced farmers to use their pesticide thereby replacing others, just eliminating their use.

Those 300k stats associate 9/10 deaths with covid just because they occurred in 2020 and they had been exposed to covid. You truly believe those 300k were covid caused? You truly believe those stats are real? I know more people getting it now than ever, and no one has any issues with it except the super old. Even they can often fight it.

Just keep old people and preexisting people on lockdown, have every one else run their businesses and live their lives. Why‚Äôs it got to be so complicated. Let‚Äôs wear masks AND shut down. Well if masks work then no need for shut downs. 
If masks don‚Äôt work then let‚Äôs not wear them. This is so not complicated but gov loves control.

If only the CDC would stop giving such guidance maybe the COVID ‚Äúdeath rate‚Äù would be lower:

‚ÄúIn cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID‚Äì19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID‚Äì19 on a death certificate as ‚Äúprobable‚Äù or ‚Äúpresumed.‚Äù In these instances, certifiers should use their best clinical judgement in determining if a COVID‚Äì19 infection was likely. However, please note that testing for COVID‚Äì19 should be conducted whenever possible.‚Äù

SPAC - EXPC currently at $10.56 expected to hit $40

Blade , an Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) transportation company Blade announced plans to go public with SPAC - EXPC 

Citing Morgan Stanley research, Blade estimates the urban air mobility market is expected to reach $125 billion by 2025 and grow to $650 billion over the next decade. It further claimed more people are now flying in and out of U.S. city centers through Blade than any other company.

‚ÄúGround mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air,‚Äù said Blade CEO Rob Wiesenthal. ‚ÄúThis transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today while providing a seamless transition to eVTOL aircraft tomorrow.‚Äù

She said keep some dry powder. Basically, don't worry, maybe take some profits in order to buy the dip, stonks will eventually go back up even higher, it's inevitable.
I agree that it may get bought by a different company, but I think the possibility is smaller than it taking a hit and rebounding.

Turning it off, and completely disco‚Äôing it for another tool are two different things.

I also did buy ATM calls for SWI... but I wish I had done them for FEYE instead... but that is because I was too busy threat hunting this week instead of really thinking hard about what company would gain the most from this

Nice.  I financed a 2016 Dart  back in June on RH profits as well.  Wanted to build credit so I got the 4 year loan.  Put a couple grand down payment.  Probably will refinance once I'm confident the warranty is unneeded anymore.  The Dart gets some flack due to Daimler's rollout strategy but it's a nice car especially the 16s.  If I can get 5 years out of it I will be more than pleased.

1). No. Because unless you had hundreds of thousands of dollars you would be limited to 100 shares. I‚Äôm talking about buying the right to purchase 100‚Äôs of shares of TSLA for $20 less than where it traded AH for the cost of a dollar a share. 

2). The options market for TSLA was anything but illiquid. They were the most actively traded options that day with tens of thousands of contracts being traded right up to close. In fact more options were traded on TSLA than on SPY Friday and that includes all the way to closing bell.

Tesla's too volatile and ppl just keep piling into it. Think of just how much Tesla short sellers lost this year. Tesla stock might be manipulated here and there but it still just keeps going up. Normally hedge funds can control the price of a stock slightly with a few million (well according to Cramer at least) but for Tesla the amount of capital needed for manipulation is quite colossal I'd imagine. Goes to show the power of Elon tweets haha.

But yeah I like the long term outlook of pltr and I think many more will come to appreciate it; lockup is expiring soon though, but there might be a pump prior to that.

I've had this thought also for a few weeks. Makes sense to me. Once the stimmy is passed what other good news is going to come out in the next three months?

this is grandstanding. you think they're actually going to pass something that actively removes avenues for them to generate wealth for themselves? truly naive, sorry.
That‚Äôs incorrect. 

*The Government Ethics Reform Act of 1989 provides for an automatic increase in salary each year as a cost of living adjustment that reflects the employment cost index. Since 2010 Congress has annually voted not to accept the increase, keeping it at the same nominal amount since 2009.* 

So Congress has not given themselves a pay raise since 2009 & has voted *against* a cost of living adjustment for a decade.

Hyperbole and FUD. What is written in a rough draft and what gets finalized are entirely separate things, and what's finalized is still subject to be altered by courts when it comes under review. Every trade agreement in history has started off with strong language like this, and it all gets watered down until they're almost meaningless after a couple decades and have to be renegotiated.

Trade deals go into practice before they're ever signed, because it takes years to put these kinds of changes into effect.

It's a double edged sword. If you're talking about ETFs, yes, they won't just dump the stock when it goes down. However, they also won't be buying extra just because it goes up.

Also, ETFs will buy extra stock if  people buy more of the ETF. They have to buy regardless of price. However, if the market goes down and people sell the ETF, they have to sell regardless of price too.

I think it‚Äôll continue to grow. Especially given the recent cyber attacks, many consumers will most likely gravitate towards a company like Palantir (who works for the CIA, FBI). A lot of spending from Palantir is being funneled into hiring sales people‚Äî which has been ignored for a large time.
International consumers is also something they‚Äôve recently started branching out to. I suspect Palantir to increase its ties with international governments( as its done with a few recently for covid support)

The mobility concept is an ever expanding and changing frontier.

Mobility as a whole may eventually transition from ICE (owned), Electric (Owned), Autonomous-Electric (Service vs Owned). Once electric starts pushing ICE out the old ICE vehicles will be quickly done away with only enthusiasts and boomers will hold onto them till their deaths. Will be interesting to see where we end up.

Like all the videos of her "shutting down" some random employee from Wall Street, but refusing to use her power as one of the 100 most powerful people in the country to actually do something about corruption.
Where you going?
I have mad anxiety and depression too, covid forced me to learn how to deal with it so I didn't do something stupid but it comes and goes. The folks talking about exercise and eating right and unplugging are right on the money. But I wanted to add that I started getting really into growing plants this year and it helps a lot. Having something you can be responsible for which shows constant progress and is aesthetically pleasing really, really helps. I have some young trees that im planning on making into bonsais in a few years. That kind of forward planning and time-scale is also super helpful for my anxiety and depression. And take your fucking vitamins.

The **Santa** Claus **Rally** refers to the tendency for the stock market to **rally** over the last weeks of December into the New Year. Several theories exist for its existence, including increased holiday shopping, optimism fueled by the holiday spirit, or institutional investors settling their books before going on vacation.

They are being punished, and gaining seats in the house for 2 years is irrelevant, that's just a typical rotation. There are more independent voters than the entire republican party, and the more toxic the republican party makes itself the less they swing in that direction.

This reminds me of the time I got my car stuck in the snow, I had to call my father he was an angry drunk with 3 fingers on his left hand from a combine accident.

Tsk tsk let me guess the weekend Dow doesn‚Äôt matter either? ü§°
If you actually look back at the internet bubble you'll see the it was not limited to revenueless companies but included plenty of solid companies and included regular companies that were also caught up in the rich valuations.

The top 5 biggest were Microsoft, IBM,  cysco, Intel and Oracle. Most of these companies took 15 YEARS to regain their highs after the crash.

Tesla will find itself in a similar situation where the best case scenario is it stagnates for a decade while the business catches up to the valuation.

Palantir is entering a new phase of public relations and selling. Historically ultra secretive, Palantir is adapting to a culture of press and selling.



Palantir catalysts to look forward to:



Jan 7th: Alex Karp has a Palantir Covid-19 special event with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. Register at https://karp.splashthat.com/



Jan 26th: Palantir's first ever Demo Day! Register at https://palantir.events/livedemoday



Feb/March: Palantir expected to report 2020 full year earnings. Will top 1B in revenue. Possible surprise profit. If the Q3 earnings report is a guide, expect lots of client success stories and Covid-19 mixed in with financial results.



New commercial contract announcements: 3rd party job boards suggest hiring related to new commercial clients. Growth in the commercial space is rocket fuel for Palantir. Coverage at https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keu3ca/pltr_will_moon_soon_i_got_proof/



New Government contract announcements: The SolarWinds hack + "cyber security agenda" of incoming Government = Palantir opportunity. Palantir has intrusion detection, monitoring, and best practices products ready to deploy. Palantir's Cyber solution can be added on top of competitor products for layered security.



Palantir 101 is in session: Palantir has launched a Medium which features success stories, tech examples, and the "Palantir Explained" series which explains what they do. Follow along at https://medium.com/palantir

I personally use options to get outsized returns, then use a portion of those returns to invest long term. It is all about capital allocation.

I divide my portfolio into 5 ideas:

Short term high alpha, mid term mid alpha, long term holds, dividends and cash.

This way I am always moving money to the long term while maintaining higher than market returns on a portion of my capital. This way you always have something to show for your work.
How about this: it goes up 100% before then and then another 100000% in 10 years, so we're both happy?

I know plenty of boomers who use Uber regularly. Think back on how fast Uber took over cities. I get what you‚Äôre saying, but I don‚Äôt think stop gaps will be necessary. We will certainly have boomers driving their ICE cars til they die, but the boomers who want a Tesla will be all-in on the tech. They might not be amazing at it, but many are gung ho about making the most of their tech. Think about that one dad you know who gets excited every time he figures out some new tech. If the Tesla driving to them is an option, they‚Äôll probably take it just to say they did.

Analysts are full of shit. Check their records. There are very few whose advice won‚Äôt bring you negative returns. They pump their positions. Or more commonly, they say a stock they want to buy is overpriced in hopes of bringing it down. An analysts calling something overpriced is always bullish. A general rule is never short anything that has a positive sloping 20 day moving average. Some people even take this further and never short a positive 50 day moving average. Doing so means you are betting against the trend and your odds off success are extremely small. It will be very lucrative if you are correct precisely because it was so improbable. But you can‚Äôt get consistent returns betting on the improbable. Even if you win one, you‚Äôll lose it all on the next.
That's how I pick my trades though
I‚Äôm just calling it out so people are watching for the breakout or the reversal

No. Mortality rate will only drop if that helps the disease spread. There is no reason for the mortality rate of COVID to drop, it's already extremely low and the incubation period + being airborne are it's primary means of spreading.

That makes it completely different from something like Ebola. Since it's transmissible only through fluids, Ebola relies heavily on human to human contact to spread between hosts. By having a lower mortality rate, ebola gets more opportunity to spread.

COVID already has an extremely low mortality rate and an extremely high rate of infection. There is literally no reason for it to alter the way it behaves once inside it's host, so it won't.

Thanks, don‚Äôt worry about it there‚Äôs plays every day
Okay tell me why MT is dead even though it was a Q1 play. Retard
This is my exact position get in here king
No but only because I already did last week lol. Watch out for the spreads and the volume is pretty low but if you‚Äôre planning on holding long you should be fine
Good point, I need to go get my suppository.
bruh you say that but intel hasn't ever even ssurpassed its dotcom bubble prices of 75$ after 20 years and has only increased their revenues by much for 20 years....

There's a reason why its pe ratio is low... and imo it's not that low... compared to its average it's not even that bad.

IMO INTC is a trap.. DO NOT BET ON THIS ONE

Its anxiety man. Unplug everything for a couple hours a day. Your brain. Your phone. Your tv. Computer. Everything. Dont smoke or drink. Go outside for a walk or jog. Ride a bike. Its helping me. Eat healthy. Laugh alot. It helps not to take things too seriously
Have you told your wife you're gay, yet?
It's entirely up to your buyer. But the exercise window is open until 8pm and won't be reflected till Monday.

If some stock closes at 50 but the AH price goes up to 52 then you the 51 call will be exercised. Same if it drops to 48 then the 49 call won't be.
This is the way
I'll start learning chinese
I should not have gambled on stimmy talks, I‚Äôm just gonna be anxious all weekend
>such a long expiry

>2 months
Seems like where we‚Äôre headed but we still have over a day to turn it around
Or you hit rock bottom, either way is good.  Ride or die.

I sold my April carmax calls for a 40% profit after it only moved 10% when the stock went up 7% last week. I feel like an idiot now, forgot they had earnings. Now I gotta pay more.

What‚Äôs the newsdude
You're required to file quarterly estimated taxes if you're expected to owe $1000 or more tax when you file your return, even as a 1099. Not paying quarterly will lead to penalties and interest owed. 

I'm no tax man, but I was a 1099 contractor for a few years, and ran a small business for a few years.
oof me too, still have a put and hope there will be a minor dip to get out. tsla wont be that volatile after being included thats for sure.

Oh no, I agree that tesla stock price can go higher. I just think it's retarded that people use some kind of fundamentals to justify the stock price going higher.

Ok so you are not familiar with the TPP (really hard to educate yourself on it and I dont mean that in a condescending way.) it has never been in place. Check out the Wikileaks drop. The 30k page draft agreement published by Wikileaks reveals intellectual property protection being broadened in an astonishing number of areas from strengthening the rights of pharmaceutical companies to allowing the patenting of plants and animals. It is, unsurprisingly, supported by more than 600 large corporations, from Nike and Walmart to General Electric and Pfeizer. Also a large part of the TPP allows companies to sue sovereign states if they dont like regulations or policy that "impede" their ability to do "do business" so say the a Dutch tells Canada that no allowing a certain additive in their gas impedes their ability to do business they can sue them. This is done through "investor state dispute settlement" and these ISDS's have been floated in other trade deals that I am ademently against. These trade deals are shrouded in secrecy so you really have to dig.  Here is a great place to start.

Really?? I think jumping rope after awhile gives decreased gains although I never tried with a heavy rope. How is it better?
Call me crazy but I think its gonna pump.  Usually huge volume into the close leads to gap ups the next day, Mondays are usually bullish, there‚Äôs still alot of institutions that need to buy, I think stimulus will finally be passed in time at the buzzer for Christmas (perfect timing for gov‚Äôt to look good), and now if SPY pumps TSLA will pump

I set up a wellness check for myself a couple of weeks from now, but starting to have some concern about the things that have been happening to me lately. I've had issues with depression and anxiety, but never like this. I've had trouble sleeping all week and at first I thought this was due to the stress I had with my call options, but I ended up getting out of those and had a good week in the market. Yet, I've still been having issues sleeping. And since last night I've noticed increased heart palpitations and just an impending feeling of doom, both of which are signs of an impending heart attack. I am really getting concerned and not sure what to do. I'm only in my late 20s.

It has a very big float for a SPAC which is why you don‚Äôt see the 10-20% up days. If anything it‚Äôs very encouraging that it has slowly kept going up the past few weeks consistently given the large float and crazy volume.

Fuck don‚Äôt know if I should sell Tesla or hold Tesla into earnings. 

Why to hold: 
1. Production numbers will be released sometime next week or the following week. Beating expectations( no way he closed down SX  without knowing he got it) 
2. Earnings
3. Balance sheet will be insane after the capital raise. 
4.rumor has it that 15 million more shares 
 still need to be purchased üëÄ
5. More FOMO from people missing out on that last minute pump 
6. That last 30 minutes sold off most people with 5% stop losses or anyone who was looking in to get a quick bucks on Tesla. Meaning that at minimum 100 million shares won‚Äôt be sold off. 
7. Elon announces something crazy 

Why to sell: 
1. Almost a 70% increase in stock price since announcement of inclusion. 
2. All the üíé ü§öüèª plebs will sell on Monday. 
3. 1,380 PE ratio. 
4.Strong support level at $600 if there is a sell off (14% downside)

When they will still control more governorships, control most State legislatures, just gained seats in the House (538 even thinks the Republicans could retake the House in 2022), and still control the Senate...well then it's a bit hard to say that voters will punish them for all of the stuff they do.

That's true, Clinton also balanced the budget. But he also had a GOP Congress from 1994-2000 and greenspan keeping inflation stable and interest rates low. It's superficial to look at the graph and make assumptions about a political party when it's more complex than that.
And let‚Äôs slice that 46% increase in half to be conservative this year

Dumb luck. I've been in and out of FAS all summer and fall, to be honest. I think the big banks will be up 30 to 50 percent by the end of next year, their balance sheets are pretty much bulletproof and I think the Fed will have to hike way sooner than anyone thinks.

How do you know it‚Äôs not going to open at 620?
I think anything under $20 is a steal. This will hugely pump as the merger approaches in a month or so, as long as you patience to hold a few months can conservatively 2x your money from here. It‚Äôs also had the highest traded volume of all SPACs for like the last 2 weeks.

Nope, not at all. Did you see how projections are derived? I am simply using AMZN's trajectory. That has nothing to do with car sales.

TSLA might pull back and pause for a bit, but it is most definitely not done.  This is a $2500 stock in 2 - 3 years.
Yeah it will but it‚Äôs not any work for you. Eventually your accounts and TOS will just be housed under the Schwab umbrella. Going with Schwab now only makes you wait longer to use TOS
> It‚Äôs not disrespectful if your partner trusts you to make those kinds of decisions on your own.

What does this even mean? It's not about trust it's about transparency. Buying a surprise car means that your wife is walking around thinking you guys have $35,000 more in the bank than you actually do. Doesn't matter how much trust she has, that is information that she needs to know. 

My girlfriend trusts me with making financial decisions. I help her decide what to do with her money and where to put it. But that does not mean that I will make a decision without her knowing about it. That seems ridiculous to me.

Cathie loves Elon and I love them both.  the end.
Yeah I get what your saying and I agree. Another way to look at it though if your talking market cap and value in dollars is scale of those values over time. What I mean by that is think about it like this. Way back in the day, say late 80‚Äôs early 90‚Äôs...no one thought that there would ever be a company worth 250b dollars or more...seemed like crazy talk. That was a huge number. Then 00 came along and people saw companies go to 500b...and we though man, that‚Äôs a huge number there‚Äôs no way we could see higher market cap companies. Then we started seeing 800b...now we‚Äôre in the trillions....and now multiple trillions....Next stop is 3-5....then maybe 5-8 and so on and so forth. Inflation of dollars...kinda like how a Coke used to cost a nickel but now it‚Äôs a 1.50. A 200b market cap company now could be worth 600b+ in a number of years from now. I don‚Äôt expect to see tons of companies reach those numbers very fast but eventually over time we‚Äôll see quite a number of companies hit 500b or more that we never thought would get there just because of inflation of dollars and that may be the new large cap size standard...just like now where there‚Äôs a large handful of 2-300b dollar companies and a couple trillion dollar ones. 

If that makes sense at all. Idk just my 2c

Just try it out and see dude. At worst you don't like it and you maybe lose out on a semester or a year, and at best you come out of college with a job in big tech making 150k+ total compensation.

Amazon and Tesla are products of their own time.
AMZN came about when eCommerce was novel. They had to overcome the part where people pay online (in addition to brick stores). Then the DotCom blew up. Its amazing they managed to raise money shortly after that. Nobody wanted to touch tech companies. It took a long time, and AMZN grew and expanded into new markets and did well. 

TSLA had a relative slow start and most people didn‚Äôt believe in it for years. Then, the pandemic happened, Model 3 launched and its everywhere. Money is at 0% and it‚Äôs a time of great uncertainty (elections, riots, economy collapsing, etc). Where would you park your money? Well, TSLA of course. 
Is there a even a close second? BA managed to screw the pooch two years ago and took down a couple of points of GDP with it. The recent IPOs of DASH and ABNB (WeWork last year) strengthen the case for TSLA. 
Is it overvalued at this point? Maybe, but it‚Äôs OK. 

Should the bubble pop, it will be OK. Like Amazon survived DotCom 1.0.
That's why Reddit wants masks to be permanently enforced

Yes that's how it works. The other part of my logic is just trying to show how far those shares are underwater.

Ooo bb you wan sum fuck?
FAS will probably be up 12% at the open Monday. Fed announced resumption of big bank share buybacks and JPM immediately said they would. Every big bank was up 4 percent after hours.
Friday was shorted to hell because loads of expiring monthlies at sub 20. Announced a big deal later on Friday and Cramer gave a positive mention Friday Eve. You bought at under 21, you could be laughing soon.

It saw a pump in the 30 mins left of after hours, expect the same Monday pre-m.
More like .30-.34.
That would be the best case scenario for holders of put options.

‚ÄúIf you own put options on stocks of a company that has just declared or filed for bankruptcy, you are in for your maximum potential reward. Whoever sold you that right to sell shares of that company at that higher price is obliged to fulfill that obligation, so your profit is guaranteed.‚Äù

Same.  I have a 2013 Hyundai and I've been payment free for 4 years now.  Feels great.  Plus, my car was part of a class action lawsuit for overstating their fuel efficiency so I get to randomly go to the dealership and update my total mileage and they send me a pre-paid debit card for the mileage.  I'm around 115k miles and they've paid me almost 400 bucks so far and will continue to pay me as long as I own the car and keep adding miles to it.  My car is paying me now.

I wondered about that, but that's not quite 2%.  You're probably using a different number for "float" than I would be... maybe.
Factor in inflation to date when comparing amzn history to tsla. Also factor in inflation looking forward. Factor in interest rates. Factor in usd to commodities ratio to see value of fiat compared historically. Consider value of fiat going forward compared to commodities going forward. These are all major economic factors that create multipliers on any valuation

6 months down the road, idk though...we got to pay the piper at some point.
Cathie Wood did invest in TSLA and I really like her. But check her trends in the last few weeks/months, she has been TSLA. Why do you think? Because the stock got ahead of itself and this is exactly what I've been trying to point out. If you look at my DCF, my implied price is higher than what's being traded at. But the point is, it feels the stock is priced to perfection at this point and we have already attributed whatever we could in terms of what future can bring into the price today.

"Boomers" was a very general term for the people with money.

So of course I was exaggerating about them being the transportation industry. What Tesla does will certainly define it, and I expect them to be the leaders.

Otherwise, what I said above is why people like Cathie Wood invested in Tesla, and why most of us continue to do so. Have you watched anything that Cathie and Tasha Keeney have been saying? If you think they‚Äôre wrong, then cool, but most people want to at least try to understand what the investors are thinking, and what we are thinking is based on listening to them... so if you want to understand Tesla‚Äôs valuation you should really be listening to them too

It would still only be rich people getting elected for shorter windows.    We need to get voters to start electing normal civilians.
Maybe you missed the news lately. MT raised prices 3x in a month. Steel orders were halted at another manufacturer so they could "evaluate market conditions". It's booming, you're losing.
What's the alternative? Keep your money parked in cash which is inflating like a mofo? Keeping money parked anywhere other than cash will be the play for the next 5 years in my opinion.

So what data are you looking for if not a list of their holdings?
AI is an emerging industry. Their technology is used in their autonomous driving right now but has potential to expand beyond that. I don‚Äôt think many people have used true AI as the technology just is not there yet. There could be a competitor to come along to take the cake which is why diversification is also key to investing. Times obviously change and other companies develop and prosper beyond that but why should that deter you from having a stake, just invest in the competition as well.

I guess I cannot see a single car company having monopolistic power in self driving cars, when the AI technology will come to point where it would be probably easy to copy and manipulate. The problem is not the technology itself, but if it can exhibit network effects. 
For instance, UBER and Lyft do not necessarily have differences in their technology, but they are trying to capture this network effects. 
If Volkswagen can also get me from Point A to Point B as good as TSLA - why do we attribute everything to TSLA today? 
They can be miles ahead now but once its time to adapt the technology, that advantage can easily disappear. Incumbent does not necessarily mean the winner in technology, especially software.

It's clear that it's more fun to make semi-profitable option trades than profitable, long-term, boring, buy-and-hold investments. 

We'd all rather take the fun than the money. And I believe this is true for most things people do in life.
Democrats would rather let Republicans destroy the stimulus and not be ham-stringed to fix the economy with Biden in office than agree to that. Would also help them with Georgia senate race. Ron Johnson destroying the stimulus/economy will in no way benefit Republicans with voters.

That's including the stock goddess Cathy Woods.

Then, it won't take long before the earnings catch up to the price if that happens.

Never underestimate the genius of a great entrepreneur. Ryan Cohen has been loudly praised by the peanut-gallery here but read any of his interviews and you'll understand that he sees an obvious plan in place. Also never underestimate the power of incentives as RC has put a significant amount of money where his mouth is, and frankly, that's good enough for me to follow.

If you study the history of entrepreneurs, you'll see that the successful one's are often able to repeat their success in other industries by using the same principles. The acid test for me was when RC single-handedly defeated Amazon in an industry that was deemed impenetrable. 

I will concede this post is light on actual business strategy and tactics, which of course can't be discounted (and is not really how I think about deals), but I would rather bet money on the power of the individual than the potential opportunities offered by the current configuration of the chess board. Bet on the jockey, not the horse, as it were. 

If you really want to talk tactics, then think real estate disposition, cost-restructuring, product expansion, culture-shift towards customer delight, and the acceptance that what will succeed in "long-term viability" won't be visible today. 

Which leads me to my next point that, macro-wise, video games will become even more prevalent than what we see today, and while competition exists, it's always easier to succeed in an industry with massive tailwinds and lots of change occurring. 

Lastly, my sense of this trade is very much "special situation retail" to which I've naturally adopted a sense of patience and developed a pungent flavor for risk that I'm willing to engage, if only for the fun of it. 

Put that altogether and yes, I'm willing to call it obvious enough to take a big position.

Maybe but I think Indexers made up the vast majority. TSLA did double the volume at close. Indexers needed to buy 160M shares and I don't even think all of them bought yet. There were 2 massive candle for TSLA. 1 was at 3:50, this was MM's hedging against a massive purchase of call options. The other was exactly at 4pm, this was most of the indexers who were required to buy TSLA at closing price, executing those orders.

What does that say about your dick if she has a *really small mouth*
You have to multiply that risk by a probability. Say that risk only occurs 10% of the time. So his payout 270 > 170. Obviously that probability is hard to calculate but that's the key to the trade.

Given the early turnout numbers and the threat from the Trumpers to boycott the election, I'm leaning dem.  If it happens then a new, much larger stimulus is pretty much guaranteed.  SPY 400 by summer.
Not to mention that half of this sub thinks that buying put means going short.

If I remember that interview correctly, he's not even talking about short selling. I remember him talking about driving the price up in order to lure others to buy into the big volume, then turn around and sell those shares at the higher price, i.e to establish a fake momentum going only to fade it and obviously increase your returns and get a fat bonus for Christmas.

Great write up. 

Watch the Cathie Wood interview with Bloomberg if you haven't yet.  She talks Tesla and why she thinks it's going +$3000.  Self driving cars.  Tesla already has exponentially more data on driving than any other player in the market. Not to mention the other tech the company is developing.  

I have no positions in Telsa because the risk/reward doesn't fit my investing strategy, but I understand why people are rosy on it.
Ah shit that‚Äôs a good point man. That would have been smart / safer. I guess I just wasn‚Äôt sure I was going to get assigned. I asked in the threads and no one was sure the exact close price (saw some say 658, others 695). 

I never put myself in this position - I always either close my positions or they are so clearly going to expire worthless / OTM that I don‚Äôt have to do anything. This was unique and on top of that, when I tried to close, my app (interactive brokers) was glitching the last few minutes and I couldn‚Äôt even get to the order screen. So I just rode it out.

But yeah hope it‚Äôs just down on Monday but that goes against the ‚Äúnever bet against Elon‚Äù. I just feel I‚Äôm going to get burned lol
WSB is my life. I‚Äôm lifeless if I get banned.
Honestly I‚Äôm long tesla and I don‚Äôt see it mooning on Monday
That‚Äôs true. Working in the casino got me exposed to many different types of people. Some of these dudes with exclusive player memberships (it requires to spend 100k or more per year on gaming) look like they just walk out from trailer park and have one set of shorts & shirt which they bought in Walmart. Cannot really judge one by clothing.
It went from 628 to 695 in 15 min Friday

Yep, the current margins are driven by regulatory credits, which are all profits as I mentioned above. They are nowhere near those margins with manufacturing, but again, I applied extremely optimistic assumptions to prove a point.

Man looking at the largest US companies by market cap in 2000...

GE, CSCO, XOM, PFE, MSFT, WMT, C, INTC in that order. It's shocking how much Citi has fallen (it used to be the number 1 for banks). CSCO and INTC are significantly lower than 2000. XOM has shown no growth. GE is going bankrupt...things change quickly. MSFT and WMT have held up well though.

The topic is asking that very question - why do you think it should overtake AMZN?
 Do you know AMZN in the last twelve months alone has generated $350 billion in revenue whereas TSLA did less than $25 billion?

That's kind of the point of the argument. They are on AMZN path - my problem is right now everything is priced to perfection. Did people really think AMZN would almost excel in everything they did in achieving this huge growth over the years back in the day? I am not so sure. So right now we are already pricing TSLA as if all of those already happened and this is what I wanted to show with a DCF - I mean my price is higher than what is traded right now. But the point is, there seems to no margin of safety in this stock anymore, because of how it moved over the past year or so.

Microsoft has been playing cleanup crew on this. They have been taking actions to secure Command and Control (C2) networks used by the attackers as well as aid those that were affected.

We don‚Äôt know the full extent of who was utilized in the exploit chain and how, but Microsoft has been so proactive to aid and assist that it would be highly unlikely that they would find themselves on the negative side of public opinion.

Through this past week they have actually seen an increase in valuation, and are a logical choice to bid for SolarWinds properties in the event of a sell off.

Yea I agree that was a huge, historical spike. Actually what you could have done to not worry is assume those 670s were going to get auto exercised (I think that's reasonable to assume since at no point AH did it drop below 670) and covered Friday Night before 8 PM in anticipation you would have to sell 100 over the weekend from assignment. 

That way you are net flat going into Monday pre market rather than having to cover then. Of course you have to be sure you were going to get assigned. But you could get lucky and Tesla can fall Monday, which will be good for you.
I just wanna piggy back off the parent comment here..... Just because this pig fucking son of a bitch doesn't understand big data and the implications of the industry he shouldn't speak on it. Fuck him in the ass with a horse.
There are so many more interesting brands with more interesting dials, more complications, better availability, etc. I'd never buy a Swiss watch without a display case back and Rolex doesn't make them afaik.

Rolex has two selling points -

1 - EVERYONE knows the brand and its the ultimate watch flex. Not the most expensive, but to non watch people it's the top brand

2 - most Rolex watches hold their value well, many appreciate in value

In the under 10k price range, I'd rather have a zenith or omega. In the 5 figure range, I'd rather have a Patek, or a Lange & sohne (imo the best looking, most interesting, classiest watches you can buy right now and their grand complication watches are stunning)

STLD didn't lose profitability like the others did and kept their dividend. If you look at the charts STLD has been on a steady climb since the crash while the others were semi flat and grew in the last month. 

This is boomer shit I know. 

NUE has been on about the same climb as STLD. Also kept their dividend because they could also take the hit and keep making money. 


MT is an inefficient over bloated company, but just sold all their american assets to CLF. 
Both companies win big there, MT loses inefficiently ran mills and CLF gets to expand their customer base. 

Look at GGB, they have barely moved.

Yeah I am assuming but just weird there is no price on them or any other info. Just a blank page now.

Just keep in mind that this crazy market is **already** valuing AirBnB more than Marriott International, Hilton, IHG, Choice Hotels, Hyatt, Wyndham (both Hotels and Destinations), Extended Stay America, and GreenTree Hospitality, and a ton of major hotel REITs combined.

AirBnB faces an incredible amount of regulatory risk because not only do they face the combined legal power of the hotel and hospitality lobbies, but any community can simply change their zoning code to prohibit or at least heavily regulate short term rentals and there is fuckall ABNB can do about it. No other lodging-related company faces that sort of risk.

Advantage of paying up from what I can tell, no penalty. Advantage of waiting and paying the penalty is that you can make a little bit more money before having to give it to the IRS.

Example, you owe $1000 then the penalty is ~$34. If you can make over that before having to pay it off then it makes more sense to wait.

I did a quick read, so I probably missed some points. 

I agree with what you said. I am just saying there might be a huge potential for Tesla to also go vertical. That is, somebody wants to make a smart coffee maker, they can use the new platform. They‚Äôll get all the goodies that come with the new tech. 

It‚Äôs like how Netflix is running on AWS. Amazon focuses on the cloud part (computing, storage, deliver, etc) and Netflix, which has its own secret sauce, can focus on content. 

In summary, who would be the leader of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Tesla has a good shot and it‚Äôs already using it‚Äôs know how on its own products. Yeah, a lot like Amazon‚Äôs path.

Heh, no kidding. TSLA's success stems from the fact that they are completely reinvisioning the automaker. There's nothing to gain from buying an old school automaker, I don't even know why we're having this discussion...

I am going to stop talking now.
why not just sell?

It's showing a lot of the shorts being underwater with the current rising stock price. If it keeps rising they'll eventually be margin called and forced to double down or close their position. If they close their position it increases GME stock price and we get a positive feedback cycle of shorters closing positions and hopefully the Volkswagen infinity squeeze
I thought they were pretty good at doing that on their own, given that they've been rated as having the second worst response to the pandemic in the world, just barely being beaten out by us.

While I agree with your general sentiment, TSLA printed 695 end of day 4 PM close Friday. The OP didn't get fucked by an override. Those 670s were auto exercised. The overrides were the people who actually chose NOT to exercise their long 680-695 calls due to the drop AH. Anything 675 and below were auto exercised and no one overrode them so it's a normal Friday situation for the OP actually. Tesla options were trading with huge IV (non zero at 3:59) since everyone knew it would be a huge print at the close.

New to Wsb (wtf am I doing here lol), but I 100% agree with this. I knew nothing about GME other than it seemed like a doomed blockbuster, however I am very LONG on CHWY and other loyalty leading companies bc I‚Äôm a huge believer of customer first companies outperforming peers if they can successfully practice what they preach (see amazon as one example. There are loads more). Needless to say, my chewy position has been good for me. 

anyhow, I am not sure how much influence Cohen will have ultimately, but I definitely agree if he can take his activism up and recreate this kind of model, this is a really good long term play..

I personally think PLTR still has a rocky road ahead in terms of valuation but any type of good news will probably boost the stock price. Depends on your risk tolerance I guess. I bought in at $30 per share so I've been stuck holding the bag for awhile.

Tesla doesn‚Äôt plan to continue selling cars. We will not need anywhere close to the numbers of cars on the road with a FSD fleet. While they will probably need more factories, they don‚Äôt need to scale production to match the current number of cars being produced. People really don‚Äôt understand the revolution coming to the transportation industry and it shows
Why i own TSLA and think of it as the next AMZN:

(Note i made a lot on AMZN buying at crazy PEs)

i own a model 3, my expenses consist of:

TSLA insurance - $110 paid to tesla monthly

TSLA superchargin - $40/month paid to tesla

Premium connectivity - $10/month


My previous car was a WRX and I never paid a dime to Subaru after owning it. TSLA is unique in where each car they sell they are guaranteeing future revenue in addition to current revenue. 

Likewise, when my friends model S got in an accident, only TSLA had the parts to repair it, and they were expensive. TSLA has locked down so many revenue aspects of the car industry its impressive. They will grow exponentially. It's truly the iphone of cars.

Idk tho

What makes you say that? I‚Äôm in on the GME trade with 1,500 shares, but I‚Äôm looking for a pop after earnings. 

I‚Äôm not convinced on the long term viability. They need to make or buy a major digital distribution platform, and I don‚Äôt see any easy way to do that. Steam is part of a 1.5B business, and Microsoft and Sony want to pull their sales onto their own platforms. In your mind, what‚Äôs the obvious path for GME?

You accounted for taxes on your profits right?  Before purchasing?
Yes. It is called a self directed brokerage account. It's convoluted because their website sucks. Call Customer support and they should be able to walk you through it. 

It'll take a week or so to open a self directed brokerage account, sell and transfer your current 401k holdings over. Vanguard is partnered with TD Ameritrade, so you'll be able to access your vanguard funds and trade using TD Ameritrade. Good luck!

Please educate me why you feel this way.  I really am genuinely interested as I occasionally think of selling puts but then realize how screwed Intel is **right now.** 

One catalyst will be when they replace Bob Swan with a real engineer.  But that won't double the PE.  You'll see a 10% move I'd say with that, and then it might slowly drift up.  But with their fabs being so uncompetitive against TSMC and Samsung, I have genuine concerns they can fall farther, even though they have a lot of revenue streams, not just i5,i7, and i9 cpus.

GME will take a year. But the likelihood of success is so much greater than the likelihood of failure. There's a well-defined path to immense profitability. It's so obvious. It won't happen via the short squeeze or in the next few months, but it definitely will happen. I haven't even considered selling.

I have 115k in oil stocks and I am very interested to see how all of this fear mongering of Covid 2.0 will be received. 

The nature of the mRNA vaccine is that it transcribes a protein that eventually produces antibodies that inhibit the virus from binding to new cells. 

So as long as the cell binding protein mechanism is the same (which it should be) this vaccine should already be effective against it.

I'll buy the dip if there is one. Maybe even dip into margin
TSLA dropped 35% in like 2 weeks in September bro. Lol. Like it or not that is a crash.

Orion has had the biggest share to date for what it does, and that is why the impact is as large as it is.

Not sure if you read the whole thing but the valuation is not based off of car sales. 
In the car sales I example, I attributed a portion of that growth to car sales and alone and stated that rest of the 200-300b future value has to come from all other businesses.

In today's value, this is roughly $60 billion or so, which is huge given that we cannot simply know what the market and profitability for those other businesses can be, not to mention competition.

Hey, I'm an old millenial. Now get off my apartment complex's landscaped lawn!
You stated TSLA is more than a car company. I agree with you there. 
You then built your valuation on how many EVs can be sold and you compared that with Toyota. 
Let me state the obvious here, EVs are cars.

As to Amazon going from books to Cloud, yes, that is a prime example of how Bezos is a genius of course, but also, how a company can have an explosive growth beyond their initial offering. 

To offer a comparable comparison (speculation at this point but plausible), we could look at this this: Amazon, started selling books, mastered e-commerce then provided their infrastructure know how to offer a killer service with Cloud offering. 

Tesla is making and selling quality EVs. They‚Äôre getting better at it and are expanding some of their offerings (solar, batteries, etc). The next possible step (like Amazon), is to offer their manufacturing platform as a service. That will wouldn‚Äôt just target car manufacturers, but any company making a product with all the benefits of Generative Engineering, BigData, AI, etc. this would be integrated with CAD software, simulation and all. Products can be designed and launched rapidly with all the benefits provided by Tesla. 

Tesla can be to manufacturing what AWS is to cloud. That‚Äôs a more lucrative path than just cars. 

Side note: Amazon bought Zoox and made some deal with BB. Is Bezos seeing this as a threat?
I think that it got the 10% circuit breaker that I didn‚Äôt know about. Market manipulators got that dip in perfect. Should have played options. Should always play options.
More like congress with corporate  bailouts.

BTW the same cock sucker (who is one of the richest senators)  that voted for the 2017 tax cuts that doubled the yearly deficit is blocking the ONE TIME $1,200 checks citing the deficit.

Is that gonna be your PhD thesis or what
After a long reflection I realized I had a great time being drunk and its worth the anxiety the next day.
Not saying no one is going to sell, there will be a dip, but I doubt it's the doomsday people are thinking it will be.  I picked up 1/3 of what was going to be my position after IPO and decided to wait until after lockup to get the other 2/3.  Well, you know what happened.  I advise that if you're waiting to get in after lockup, average across instead.  It may drop from 45 to 38 after lockup and you'll be bummed you didn't get in at the 20's.

\*Edit, the numbers are just an example and in no way a price target.  Gamble accordingly.

Maybe OP knew exactly what she wanted. Certainly that is two different kind of surprised. Making the purchase early versus a "novel" purchase so to speak.

Pay your taxes.
Well alot of people do long shots on this sub because that has the best returns but as soon as it moves against you the option gets nuked. So once it's down so much you might as well hold because things like [ this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kfuzyw/i_wrote_a_script_that_tracks_the_days_highest) can happen. Holding itm doesn't matter much close to expiry sinc eit trades near 1:1 so really it's just being greedy hoping it goes up more but it going down won't hurt to bad. Everyone trades different and has diff risk tolerance. I only put into options what I'm willing to lose whereas some people Wil say once I'm down x% I'll sell. But then what if it bounces back you feel even worse or what if you think that and hold and it keeps bleeding. So to me only "betting" what I'm ok with losing let's me be ok watching it go to 0 and maybe it'll bounce back. If you're new go in slow but again everyone has diff tolerances and lives so ultimately do you but for every post of people making 1000% there's plenty not posted of people losing it all.

I was in AMD during the heady Opteron days and made a killing on the huge runup (I turned $10K into > $1M just rolling calls), and held Intel from 2008 until late 2017.  Then I switched to AMD LEAPs and have been rolling those.

Just bought a Kia Sedona with my trading profits!!!

Yesterday went to the dealer and bought a 2018 Kia Sedona EX with trading profits from this year. It's a Christmas surprise present for my wife. I'm not telling anyone, but it's hard to keep the secret because I'm so excited, so I figured I'd tell you degenerates.

This was my first profitable year since I started trading/investing in 2017. I was down 35k at one point, but managed to make it back and then some. DM me if you want to ask more about it.

And yes I wish I could say I bought a Tesla or something. But we got three kids and still driving a 2014 sedan, and we've been making do with it, but damn I think this minivan is going to make things soooo much easier! (Also, I'm cheap...which is something I've noticed in profitable traders as well...even if they make bank, they are still conservative with money and look for deals lol)
Yeah it would be understandable if I never told her my fetishes then just came out with them one day and her perception of me changed but she knew this from day fucking one.

Most gains from a single position was ARWR, which I'm still holding 900 shares of. I had 1930 shares before at like a $45 avg, which I held thru the covid lows. That was crazy. 

I day trade mostly though, so ARWR contributed like 1/5 of the gains. Lost big on AMRN too, which offsets most of the ARWR profits. Still holding both
I think youre forgetting that valuing a company now a days has almost nothing to do with fundamentals. 

Snowflake is 193X sales.... Saying Snowflake is priced to perfection is a understatement. Dont get me wrong, Snowflake has a stellar business model and idea, but lets be real. Because if I had to put money on it, I will bet you in a years times AWS, Microsoft, IBM cloud, basically any other company with a already built could infrastructure will be able to walk in and take market share. 

Its just like when Zoom became a noun and everyone used Zoom a wild Microsoft appeared with in my opinion a better platform. Teams is far better because it links with Outlook and basically every company uses outlook for their email. For every 1 zoom meeting I do I have 10 teams meetings. 

People dont care that the fundamentals are shit. Tesla could offer another 5 billion in stock and people will eat it up right now. Tesla basically has a unlimited pocket book with equity offerings right now. 

Amazon grew at amazing rates becasue nobody could compete for 15 years. Even now nobody can compete. Walmart is working on it but they will ship you your ship and take a week.

You do realize that this market is still largely a two supplier market, correct?

It's transitioning, and extremely quickly, from an 85/15 split Intel/AMD to a 15/85 split.  In a lot of markets, AMD is *already at* over 80% marketshare over the last month.

Take a look at Intel's 10K, and what happens when you cut the top line by 40%.  Because that's what happens when you lose marketshare so dramatically in a segment that constitutes 50% of your revenues.

If all the retards here and basically every financial institution think that the company has a bright future ahead of it, regardless of what price point they think the stock should be at currently, why would he sell the instant he can?

Maybe, but the shear size of TSLA required 160M shares to be bought at close. That kind of buying was enough to move the price up $45. There were 220M shares traded Friday. Breaking the market record for the most amount of capital flowing through an equity.

I‚Äôm not gonna stick around for a girl who finds a new guy every other week and catches feelings for them, she doesn‚Äôt want to cuck me so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs gonna date us all at the same time. If you want your fuck boys then keep them but say bye to me
If it's deep itm or when it gets close to expiration the value of the option is very close to the value of the shares. Exampl you have 32c if it trades at 35 in June your option will be worth like 3.03 or something. This holds true unless it's an Uber volatile stock like tesla where small moves cna shave or add more than a 1 to 1 maybe 1.1 to 1.1. In terms of exercising I never see the point unless your plans changed and you're willing to hold it even longer. Example you bought a call for 30 on a good dividend stock and it explodes to 50. It's now worth owning that stock for 10 yrs to you. Also if you get super long calls more than a year. Selling is probably better because you'll pay long term tax and if you exercise the clock resets on the shares so you could be taxed more if you hold less than a yr after exercising. To answer your question everyone here watches their options expire at 0 here. Tbh if your new to this I'd try and hit breakeven asap. What I mean is if you bought 20 contracts and they double up sell half and you don't have to worry about it then. You'll miss gains but there's plenty of posts here of people up 1000% for it to just go to 0 the next week.
Haha Transfer that to a real broker ASAP!
I will be really surprised if Tesla does not drop like a bursting bubble in the next 3 years. When exactly? I can't tell you because I lost my fortune telling license.

People talk about how economy screwed but feel like we live in two different worlds.

Local builder who is friend of mine decided to open up a reservation for a 20 home lot in one day everything was reserved, people are offering 10-20% over ~ 1 million asking to get in. keep in mind you need to pay 10% + upgrades for reservation which could easily be 150k and people are ready to wire that next day is crazy.

This is not close to some IT hub people just seem to be flushed with cash.
Lol what?
IDK if youre serious but theres a few really strong indexes I like to trade calls on.

$HERO is a video game and esports ETF that is up 86% this year.

$IPO is an ETF linked to IPO prices as they go public and is up 111% this year.

And of course theres $TQQQ, a 3x leveraged index of daily NASDAQ movments and its up 91% YTD

Theres a lot more of course but those three are on my watchlist.

Let me be very clear: PG&E and California as a whole is ran by retards with muscular dystrophy, and schizophrenia. This will be a massive multi-billion maybe even trillion dollar failure. Tesla will have already built an unbeatable charging network before they pat themselves on the back at the ribbon cutting ceremony for their first station. And they‚Äôll have spent at least a billion dollars to get there. This will be an absolute disaster, and taxpayers will foot the bill AGAIN. That being said, with Biden an Newsom handing out tax credits like candy that might actually end up being a good thing for PG&E

I there are at least two ways to play an expected dip with options. One is to buy puts, the other is to sell naked calls. In order to manage risk, you might sell a bunch of naked calls way out the money because how is TSLA going to get that high? So it's basically free money, just collect the premium. So a lot of people do this. Now if the calls go ITM, all is a sudden you have all these call holders executing their options. This means everyone that sold the naked calls needs to find shares, and this puts demand on the buy side now that sort investors all need shares all at the same time.

The feedback loop happens when the higher price pushes more options ITM, starting the cycle anew. 

Sorry for your loss.

Yeah but literally 10‚Äôs of thousands of people have moved to Sacramento from the Bay Area over the past 10 years and still commute back and forth.
so you are comparing a company that revolutionized a whole industry and creates real products and are beloved by their customers, that is also making a shit load in revenue. To a bunch of shitty websites with 0 revenue and no fanbase? The dotcom bubble was insane because it was people being excited about the internet in general not about a specific company. 

I would agree that EV companies are in a bubble but im sure tesla will come out on top and there aren't even that many ev companies with insane valuation like internet companies in 2000. 

have fun losing money and opportunity. 

Also can you name the singular company that tanked the entire market in the .com bubble? i doubt you can because thats not how bubbles pop.

Yep!
There will be a squeeze. Not all at once, i don't think, but definitely over time will put upward pressure on. Any short that doesn't want to wait 4-7 years is going to be looking for the exit.

There definitely are long term shorts who are in it for the goose egg but that's not all of them. Some got in because they thought COVID was going to end GME. As it becomes more clear that's not going to happen you can expect more covering.

When Q4 comes in at +30% yoy you can expect more and more covering as the reality of GME having a lot of time to pivot sets in. If they make even more progress on Omnichannel (it just means online sales guys, that's all) then expect the floodgates of covering to open. 

If GME is doing well enough to threaten to reinstate its dividend that can also get some shorts to capitulate. The time horizon for a short gets dramatically compressed if they have to pay a dividend too. It would also be a display of confidence by the board.

I've said it before, I've never seen a better setup for tendies in my entire life. Short positions are about to get hammered again and again by good news.

Lastly, if you're inclined to buy or to yolo, no need to rush. There will be down days or down weeks. The ER may have been the best entry but maybe not, stand ready to buy the dips. Do your own homework, of course, view all relevant memes, talk to your financial advisor and your wife's boyfriend, etc.

No bullshit man and i have said this before: Almost all my biggest losses have come from paper handing my plays. Not just losses, but also potential gains. I have left a lot of money on the table by getting out far too early. I‚Äôve started to set more limits on both sides for myself now. Like i wont cash out unless price hits x and I won‚Äôt cut my losses unless price hits x. When i make a play i go into it expecting it to be a total loss in order to stick to that plan. It has helped me to scale down positions so that I‚Äôm less likely to be over leveraged and trade emotionally on it to the upside or the downside.

It's already been catching on though. Using leg up, consolidation, into same size leg up, I'm expecting next leg up to take it to a little over 10 maybe even 11. It's already popped above this last consolidation phase's down trendline so next leg up could have already started.

Really depends on your strike, if it's just a dollar or less OTM, then you might get something, but personally, I don't have any calls before March, with most of them being in June and July. MT 24c July and AA 23c July for example. One thing that I think will send these stocks soaring is when Biden repeals those dumbass Trump tariffs, and I don't see that happening until at least March -- too much other shit to clean up first. There is a whole global supply chain that has to gear back up, and that's going to take a bit of time to show up in the earnings reports, it's not like tech where you just throw up more servers and hire more people and suddenly you're scaled up. Mines have to increase production, ships and trains have to transport the raw metals, they get processed at smelters and foundries and sent on. Steel manufacturers are looking at a backlog of orders 1-3 months out, so even the price increases that are happening now won't show up in earnings reports until the backlogged ordered from the old prices are cleared out. Materials, shipping, and industrial stocks move a lot slower, so I'm not one to use rocket emojis in their context. Think of it as a freight train going up hill; it fully loaded with tendies and its heading to you, and all you gotta do is wait. There are going to be red days between now and then, this isn't a fast money play or trying to time entry and exit, it's something you put money in now and forget about it until Summer and Spring.
"Anticipated" is pretty generous wording for this.
How‚Äôs that going?
So you are saying that in coming years when the federal reserve/treasury institutes a digital currency they will be looking for a large wide ranging data crunching company to be able to manage inflation and the money supply as a whole and with its already natural relationships with the us government, palantir is poised to move into that spot. Where palantir along with the federal reserve could become the new gate keepers of world commerce. And occupy what they banks currently do? Damn I‚Äôm in to buy 10 more shares.
It's cause none of us are that retarded to hit triple 0's like that. Or ever had any money to withdraw. To know what this screenshot looks like
You're flirting with practical, real-world advice saying that.  We're on wsb. There's no place for that here.

Technically this is priced in as the world as a whole has already experienced the 70% rate increase. We just assumed it was from people being dumb, now we know it was at least partially due to a more contagious strain. Very little affect on the market as this is backwards looking not forward.

Well in 2014 it traded for 40-50 and it was only at 40-50 again mid 2019. It fluctuated a lot, but most of the growth in price occurred end of 2019-2020. So depending on when you bought, you could have obviously made a lot or lost some up until 2019 basically (all post split)

Look at their chart and consider we're finally leaving 2020. The news, I expect, is about to start getting better and better every single month.

This market is all about momentum. Look at FSLY. I thought it would need 6 months to get back on track but it's over 100 again already.

Momentum in this market is king. You don't have to be very smart. Buy things that are going up already. Yes, it will dip and test your paper mache hands. Either get the shares or get leaps (preferably both). Be ready for 3 month long drawdowns.

This year, next year, the year after...you have to be long in the market playing hard.

My sell trigger is nasdaq 30K (or thereabouts). Right around there will be when this bubble matches the dotcom.

Cause SW was hacked and that hack led to 40 other companies being hacked. So all of those cybersecurity companies like CRWD McAfee proofpoint etc all failed to not only protect Solarwinds they failed to protect ALL of the victims.

Not a single one of them has said: oh yea we saw that threat and warned the customer which is THEIR ONLY FUCKING JOB. instead, their stocks are going up super big.

So tell me, if you worked for a cybersecurity firm and were paid mostly in stock. Would you do your best to protect your customers if you knew every time there is a hack you get to retire 5 years earlier?

or

Would you actually try to make it more likely that there are attacks [even do the attacks yourself] to drive demand for your useless products? I mean Russia gets blamed anyway right?

The Tesla stock price in June 2017 was - adjusted to the stock split - around 70 dollars. Meaning he picked up around 143 shares. Those would now be worth $96,134.

Agreed with your sentiment about wanting to see both ends of the GME conversation.

I'm all in on GME, but not like most. I'm not counting on short squeeze or Cohen, just enough of a console cycle bump over 12-18 months and some level of stabilized sales before 24 months. Short term BK is not a concern but may be in 2+ years.

I have a calendar spread covered strangle 1/2022 and 1/2023 expiry. -30C and -5P. Premiums stupid high thanks to GME meme stock status, brought my cost basis down to $7.50 when purchased @ $12.72.

Basically, as long as we stay above $7.50 I'm a very happy camper. Fair value price target of $25ish between June-December 2021 in my opinion but it may be rocky until then and activity will be nutty with next earnings call regardless of what's reported. Don't expect the stock to do what you think it will, whatever that is.
You do realize PCG was founded in 1905 and is the owner of the grid for most of Northern California?

I‚Äôm buying puts next month if indices have a strong 1-3 weeks ahead.

This is coming from somebody who made a shit ton of money in 2016 during the SCTY buyout and has never shorted Tesla before, or bought puts on them.

Incorrect. The social contract in a democracy is actually built on skepticism, not faith. The voters are given a vote to keep the government in check, not to blindly support it.

Apple making their own chips now. Microsoft just announced Friday they will make their own chips for servers and surface books.

THIS. They came in the 90s while the wet foot , dry foot law was in place which gave (from my knowledge) exclusively cubans the right to instant citizenship if they reached the shores... which my parents did. Their argument is that if they came legally, everyone else should be able to without realizing how big of an outlier they are and they are literally the 0.0001% that had an opportunity like this considering that law is no longer even in effect... 

They also hate immigrants because in the immigrant community its very common for the immigrants to not fully integrate into society or really push for success. My parents meanwhile came to this country & learned english & have become MASSIVE patriots on top of owning 2 successful businesses. They refuse to acknowledge that not everyone has the strive like they do or again, has the opportunity.

Have to get your timing right with most physical commodities as few are great long term plays (other than maybe gold).  Its why I bought cry pto and carbon credits instead as my long term commodity play.  Suck at timing.
General rule of thumb. Get to know your partner before someone else does üëÄ yes bruh especially the little things
I think so much speculation baked in along with asset inflation encouraged by the fed like never before has caused not just TSLA but the majority of the market as a whole to reach these insane valuations on a lot of these tech and EV stocks. TSLA is a more special case with the continual short squeezes caused by retail hype. It's going to keep going up until it doesn't. JPow even said earlier this week that stocks aren't that high. Probably saying it to make sure it doesn't crash.

A lot of financial analysts on youtube have been saying SPX to 4500 before a major crash that's probably bigger than march. I use tea leaves and swing both ways but definitely more biased to the downside and this has cost me money especially earlier in the year in August.

Why was your account restricted? That's not really a drop to 0 right?
Also don't be disheartened. Underneath all the trolling, we care about you. Reach out to any of us if you wanna talk. Retards who post their losses on wsb are usually regarded as the ones with the biggest balls, able to laugh at their losses with the ppl here while simultaneously making a plan to get it all back
Yeah bro you‚Äôre right. Attraction is relative. Different strokes for different folks
Ahhh man... you become so angry at someone but once that anger wears off; you come back to normal & find out you‚Äôre just an idiot for being angry.
They‚Äôre both pretty sad limp dick energy affairs

asking the real questions.
Definitely the most useful
Commodities are going to rip... this is the perfect environment for them....high stock prices, a wreckless fed , cash and speculation everywhere, bonds that yield nothing everywhere, a demand supply imbalance building up just in time for the summer, and currencies that are all overvalued and some possibly headed to zero. Oil and gas stocks are tricky but as long as the fed is supporting the markets, There‚Äôs a real potential that oil rises like it did on the front end of the gfc when it went from 100-160 in a speculative frenzy fueled by rising interest rates and an overvalued stock market... The situation really isnt much different in fact its a lot more conducive to higher oil prices because supply has been cut drastically and demand plus a falling dollar is increasing as economies start to open up again. Plus bonds are yielding practically nothing now and back then they yielded 3 percent and the National debt was probably 6 trillion where as now its over 20 trillion. People should be getting out of financial assets and buying hard assets that hold their value.  I think its already happening but people won‚Äôt realize it until its out of control.
man i'm fucked i left the only woman i ever truly loved a few years ago.. thats about it with family life for me
Did you fucking idiots really miss the stories about this strain from last week? Lmao.
Damn, I tried posting about QS here a few weeks ago, and it said that it was a penny stock.
You may literally be retarded.
i got assigned too, so I'm short 100 tesla shares at 675, or 683 if u add in the option premium. oh wells, will try to close on Monday,  might do premarket if i see it under 680 at that time
Stfu üåàüêª before you get gang rape
In Soviet Russia, option expires you
I sold mine on the 17th. Someone out there thought QS was gonna plummet 33% in a single day and paid me good money for it. 

Fucking bizarre. 

I'll happily take their money though.
What are some good stock ~~gambling~~ trading movies or shows?
>That's like going to Vegas and putting everything on one number in roulette. 

Put it all on 42.  I got a feeling about that number.

Sir the wheel only goes up to 36. 

Ok put it all on 36.  I got a feeling about that number.
You said you were down some before. Hopefully you realized a few of those losses so you can write them off. Next look for charities that don't use most of the money for cost of operations bc those are scams. Better than that money going to the tax man
So are 1 month calls no beuno? Or are they gonna print? üöÄüöÄ
The smoke started to taste like fruit I was so baked
Can anyone please point me in the direction of a simulated market where I can place options and see how well they would have done please?
Damn selling real estate in their Minecraft server? Genius
Be cooler if you actually had positions in them
LOL right?
If I remember correctly the ticker was already down over 70% on market open, so it‚Äôs not like a stop loss would have prevented much. But yeah I was new to investing at that time and did some pretty retarded shit. The good thing is I only invested a pretty small amount of money that I was ready to lose, so it sucks but at least I learned some lessons before I started investing any serious money.
>Pulled the trigger on only 4 TAK 25c 2022 leaps last week after also seeing ARK consistently buy it. Up 20% already on them lol

Other than spying on everywhere you go and when and selling that info to the highest bidder I guess yes?
Plz short it
this is the bottom
Ban
At $1M with 5% down, assuming $1k/month for taxes and insurance, you're looking at maybe a $5500/month payment which you could be approved for with a $150k salary.

At $2M, everything doubles, so you could be approved for that with a $300k salary.

So whether you need $250k salary depends on how close to $2M you go (and likely your interest rate as well; I assumed 4% on a jumbo loan).

It makes more sense to have F prefund this expense than USPS. USPS is a growing business due to rise of online retail whereas legacy car companies are going to shrink in the near future which means they will have more and more retirees to support with a smaller revenue base.

Concept companies used to be relegated to the penny stocks. That they're now raising hundreds of millions if not billions is troubling, especially for investors that don't read SEC filings and financial statements.

What many dont know is these companies SPAC because the regulations on making  forward looking statements is looser than with traditional IPOs. Basically they can make really optimistic forward looking projections, which they do...to offload stonk to dreamers

I think what people miss about the TSLA bubble is that it has become like a Ponzi scheme. It needs new investors to keep it going up. Once it starts to go flat (or even down) the meme investors will dump

TSLA has been going up because it is in a state of perpetual increases - which leads more people to FOMO in. 

Once the perception of ‚ÄúTSLA is free money‚Äù is gone people will move on to the next one.

Needless to say - the actual valuation based on the underlying company is a joke

Usps is in rough shape because they need to prefund the expenses, instead of relying on actuarial assumptions.

I agree. I've been exposing myself to public as little as possible to prevent me personally impacting others, besides in situations where everyone is being reckless and taking the risk. Tbh I was very hardcore on the quarantine for the first few months bc I firmly believed that would be the solution to flattening the curve, but it's like when the general public and the government knew there would be a second wave and had all this time to prepare infrastructure but still failed, my actions have no meaning if I were quarantined or not

Especially when you didn't really do anything to earn it, like a specialized career, starting a business, etc. He was just lucky that he choose right.

But I mean come on, if you're stupid enough to allow yourself the subject of a piece on Bloomberg about how lucky you were in choosing the right stock, you're stupid enough to get taken advantage of financially.

In and out of blackberry for quite some time and a long term holder.  


I do think BB is undervalued compared to other tech but the track record doesn't deserve any amounts of high speculation from wall street at this time.  


Quarter after quarter they've been on the dot with estimates and quarter after quarter Chen's lack of enthusiasm has hurt stock price. Even this CC, Chen was a wet mop and said no IVY revenue until 2023 (model year so more like middle of 2022) and that CRUSHED all the speculators who jumped in on the Amazon WS deal.  


If you believe in QNX / Cylance or any other one of their offerings to catch ground and start growing like crazy BB is still a long term hold stock. My hope is in QNX but only time will tell.

As written, the two largest firms invested hold 6 seats on the board. When the public disclosure was imminent (forced by FireEye‚Äôs impending disclosure) the two largest firms (Silver Lake and Thoma Bravo) dumped $280MM in holdings of a company that was climbing without any public knowledge of anything that should stop the climb.

This has not reached peak understanding by the public.

Yeah - truly insane that SPACs are bringing companies public that only have a pipe dream. Recent examples are all the EV trash like LAZR, QS, NKLA
"The U.K. imposed a fresh lockdown across London and most of southern England to combat the spread of a new strain of coronavirus.

The new variant of the pathogen transmits more easily from person to person, the country‚Äôs top doctor said, and accounted for more than 60% of new cases identified in London during the week through Wednesday. There is no evidence it is any more deadly or resistant to vaccines, he said.

The new lockdown means many families won‚Äôt be allowed to gather for Christmas. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who only days ago said it would be ‚Äúinhuman‚Äù to cancel Christmas, said, ‚ÄúIt is with a very heavy heart, that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned.‚Äù

True, WSB doesn‚Äôt have the power to move global steel
I don‚Äôt fuck with options unless I‚Äôm extremely confident in a stock. I swing trade stocks on momentum and usually hold anywhere from 1 week to a month. I trade everything from large caps to SPACs. Right now I‚Äôve got half my portfolio in ARKK that I bought at $102, and the other half in a few SPACs.
BTW this is also why I am long on Blackberry BB. They are building the Appstore for all cars other than TSLA based on their QNX operating system. Apple and Google through CarPlay want you to use their mobile apps and avoid ccannibalizing mobile sales. BB doesnt care about Mobile sales as they are out of the Mobile business.

Welp....you may have been exposed. If you wore a mask, and have been around infected. Then you may have been exposed to small viral loads, not enough to make you severely ill. After time, your body build immunity...then when you finally do contract it, it would have been asymptomatic.

There was a study done on a cruise ship that required masks and one that did not. The one with masks ended up have a significant number of asymptomatic covid infections (because they developed some form of immunity wearing masks) the cruise without masks had a high number of severe symptomatic covid 19 infections.

I wonder if the index set a single price they would pay as they neared closing, and then it all just executed at that price regardless of current market price.

MMs made fucking bank with a spread that big. Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if MMs purposely drove the price one way to make the spread as big as possible to capitalize on the inclusion. 

In the end, the index doesn‚Äôt care what the spread is the stock will basically be worth whatever they say it is after they buy that many shares. Retail traders like us can all get fucked tho, lol.

Ford is definitely not reporting Union retirment liabilities as part of GAAP. Noone is besides USPS which is why the outrage at USPS being treated unfairly. GAAP by definition does not include future healthcare costs. Most people use Medicare in retirement exept if they are legacy Union in which case the company is on the hook for Healthcare costs and that is a huge cost with the Boomers retiring.
Havnt you ever wondered why the legacy companies keep factories open even when lossmaking? Early retirement for those folks would be more expensive due to the healthcare costs.

Now look @ the performance between the 2 ETFs [here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VTI&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=VOO&allocation2_2=100)

Negligible difference. At 1% weightage, TSLA isn't big enough to make VOO or SPY yo-yo around
u/CobraKalls gives you a great link. But don't even think about it as a MOC order. Just think about a normal situation. Say bid-offer is 10.50-10.60 (some random stock) but there is 100 size at 10.60, 100 size at 10.61 and so forth (I'm making this simple here). If someone buys 10000 shares as a market order, he/she is going to go through all those price points 10.60, 10.61, etc since the offer doesn't have that size all at one price point. If you are a MM and you see someone buy a huge size, you aren't gonna keep offering to him/her at 10.60. You would step back and sell at higher price points.
thanks!

They do not have 3-4 years. They may only have 3-4 weeks. As stated by u/jtfooog customers are not patching, they are eradicating.

The company will not merge. There newfound reputation of negligence is not an asset any player wants to acquire.

Most likely bet is that the company folds, and to resolve debt they sell off all assets with Orion and other products being amongst them. The products will not die, but the provider will.

Toyota has better assembly lines for cultural reasons. They build a fanatical loyalty to the company to the extent that people sacrifice their personal lives (working 16 hr days) for the betterment of the company. Japanese men are able to do this by pushing all family responsibility onto Japanese women who culturally still do not have equal rights in society. its not a model scalable to a western workforce.

It's a clause officially ending the Fed Small Business lending program, which by all accounts was an abject failure (only lent $3-$4 billion of an allocated $400+ billion).  

Republicans don't want to have a $400 billion slush fund available for the Biden administration to be able to use as a backdoor bailout of states and cities with the $400 billion once he takes office.  

Then, if Biden wants to allocate that $400 billion it would require Congressional action

That‚Äôs my game too, waiting for a dip and then going in. 24 is my entry. I was in 16 to 24 and then had some fun trading in the current kangaroo range.
MY shares are up but not moving like I'd hope. We are on the cusp of a breakout.
Have people considered the competition of GameStop?

How is it on the path to be the biggest digital retail platform for gaming? 

It has to compete with steam, gog, epic games store, and more for software. 

In terms of hardware it has to compete with essentially everyone. Best Buy, Amazon, manufacturers, and many more. 

The only good thing I‚Äôve seen lately is there deal with Microsoft. 

I just don‚Äôt see GameStop growing passed the shitty retail company that it has been for years.
We choose to trade on margin. We choose to trade on margin in this market and baghold the other things, not because they are good positions, but because they are -99%, because memes will serve to organize and measure the best of our autism, because expiry is danger that we are willing to accept, one we are legally unable to postpone, and which we intend to win, and the other trades, too.
So you‚Äôve been reckless?
well the last two weeks has been basically flat, so actually not the worst time to get in.  And yeah, dont go all in but rather add during dips
Yea of course. Selection bias is like the biggest bias in life. Even like in sports everyone thinks they can make the NBA growing up since they see their favorite athletes on TV but most won't even play college basketball even if you were the most dominant player on your 10 year old team.

Buying contracts to exercise makes no sense.  You won‚Äôt get whatever weekend prices you‚Äôre seeing, and will end up spending more by trying to do it as you‚Äôve described.  You‚Äôll just need to cover the shares.  If you value holding onto your calls, for future exposure, then just buy the shares at a price you can deal with.  Having short shares and long leaps is an interesting position.

There is no reason not to. I finally paid off all my debt. I‚Äôm doing %20 contributions to my 401k now and I have no problem yoloing a whole check because I have done it before on stonk now just to do it on options perpetually
So that was the big Tesla spike from inclusion? Lol some of y‚Äôall made it sound like it was going to $900
I was down around $10K in TDOC calls over the summer, I finally broke even on the morning of strike date and was super relieved to sell for modest profit... but if I had waited like 3 more hours I could have made $20K on the trade.
We'd all be better traders if we did coke tbh.
spreads are considered low risk. your odds of losing can be around 15% to 20%

however, you're spending more money to cover your risks, and your returns drop, even if your odds of winning improve. losses will also cost more than the wins you get

over a longer term, if you have 8000 wins, you can still be wiped out with a few losses

risk management is key, and position sizing is probably the most important factor. never go all in, and stay out of the hail mary mindset

measure your risk-reward, and minimize and prevent losses

I have a very good idea. The only way legacy companies can stay in business is declaring bankruptcy and moving all their union liabilities onto the tax payers. So the future value of their shares is 0 given that Bankruptcy will wipe out existing shareholders and the Dscounted value is actually negative.

Hey did you know if you had just pulled out you could‚Äôve bought a Tesla? Kidding aside nice grind and keep up the gains!
Done!
I just bought a 78 Chevette on Sunday with my profits. (Serious). Was my Christmas present too. If I had diamond hands it would have been a Corvette but paper hands get what they get.

If you look at the charts of value of 10k invested in tesla you actually would have lost money up until essentially 2019, its only been the past year or two really that you would've made any money.

I made a similar post about this last week and some guy already made 15K off of puts lmao
Through options or shares.  Not a mil in 1-3 years!   And this year was a total anomaly.  You know we don't usually start early in the year at fire sale pricing like we did this time.

It just seems to me we focus too much on the positive outcome we want that's unrealistic (time wise) and not enough on the outcome that's more realistic.  At least if you're not smart about it.  Which I think gets a lot of people into trouble.

Even for a gambling oriented sub, we tend to promote some really dumb stuff here.  This year has been especially heinous.

Mistake number one: you just assumed they only sell CDs now and will continue to do so in the future

Mistake number two: you assumed that gaming nerds are their only customers and forget the rest of casual gaming people & kids & parents\grandparents buying for kids. The hardcore gaming crowd might not even be the core customer base right now (but might become in the future if they start offering gaming hardware or whatever shit that might be relevant to gamers)

I worked at a Lexus dealership as a mechanic for 11 years. That whole industry is fucked. 

New car sales was the biggest profit maker, service which relied mostly on warranty, and then parts which were marked up so high it was criminal. 

I was the labor and I got worked like a dog for peanuts despite being the one who fixed all the problems that rolled into the service lane. 

Union? lul. Right to work states. You don't like your one pay raise in ten years. Eat shit. 

I could wax on for hours about how bad that shit was but it's clear that model while serving a purpose is corrupt from the ground up. 

If there are any playbooks TSLA needs to follow it's Toyota's assembly lines. They are notoriously better than other manufactures.
So does anyone actually know what happened with that 695 spike in Tesla at close? Wtf was that?

You bought tsla puts didn‚Äôt you retard
I agree BUT this isn‚Äôt a stock, it‚Äôs a cult. And to buy puts is a very expensive game to play as IV is routinely 200% and I‚Äôm sure it will be over that Monday morning. Was up to 500% yesterday. I mean you need an absolute tank to make money on that bet. 

Could happen but wayyy to rich for my blood to try. Good luck though, for what it‚Äôs worth I‚Äôm sure there will be a correction. Not not sure it‚Äôs enough to be worth it or quick enough. People may hold waiting to sell until there‚Äôs a solid decline pattern (or rise).

Somewhat misleading since that assumes 2 parent households but yea in general all the people living not on the two coasts and some of the big cities in between make less on average/median but just have lower costs to make up for it. Like a 50k salary in Wyoming is solid.

I think they should buy Jones Soda co. Someone make a post about that
I literally just saw this quote on another thread few minutes ago. Lmao
Look at snowflake they had a ma\~30% run RIGHT BEFORE LOCKUP.  Snowflake had a partial lockup release earlier this week and their float went from 32.2M to a total of 110.6M overnight. This is roughly a 3.4x increase in float volume. PLTR is going from \~.5B to \~1.7B float (a 3.4x increase in float). When the lockup expired for SNOW their SP dropped by \~15% and it is now recovering. We can expect a \~15% drop once this lockup is done after we get a massive run.

Do you all think amazon will hit 3100 again before touching 3300?
Honestly the bill should be scaring people but as long as the price of the little tickers on the screen keeps going up no one seems to care how badly the future will look when the bill comes due. What were doing is more wreck less than people realize. There is literally no way out. Could you imagine if powell had to taper his bond purchases or unwind the balance sheet? What would interest rates be then? If they go above 3 percent which is normally extremely low, how much of our gdp would go to just paying down debt?

You mean through options? Yea most people lose money on options. But if it's shares, since most stocks go up and there's no time decay, most people will make money. Maybe not Tesla money but good money this year for almost all only long stock holders.

u have to find the nikola losers
Selling Carbon credits is on the books. TSLA is not hiding off book liabilities like the legacy car makers. Go analyze their filing for all their union liabilities and you will see none of them are actually profitable.

I do agree they get a tech valuation as they have built a platform akin to the Appstore on which they can start selling 3rd party apps (once FSD starts to work you need something to engage you while the car does the driving).

I expect apps sold for in car use to be as big a business as apps sold for the iPhone
Much appreciated, I'm nodding my head
Laziest bear case I've read on GME. Imagine if our entire DD was based on PS5 sales, lmao.
My bad! You have a point. As a degenerate I hate reading too much myself. 

Dude I‚Äôd do a combo of straight stonk and possibly some leaps. Go to like a $20 strike and I bet they print! I‚Äôd say do shorter term but this is the first time they have spoken to investors in like 6 months. I have a feeling now that they broke radio silence the next step will be to schedule regular earnings releases again and when they do, I bet we get a run into earnings. Then if they keep showing growth like this and the fact that the announcement stated that they reached break even profitability in august I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see it completely revalued.

I personally have 2k shares straight up. So that‚Äôs my approach.

I‚Äôm so pissed because I could‚Äôve made so much money on obvious sure things but I only put a bit of my portfolio in to diversify. Like the day TSLA S&P 500 inclusion was announced I bought 3 shares even when it was already up 12% because I was like lol it‚Äôs TSLA people will meme it off it‚Äôs ass. Like I could‚Äôve just liquidated my whole portfolio and put into TSLA and made 50% in a few weeks (or even more if I bought calls)
well sure, can try, but dont bet too much on it. also they dont rly have bad news on the way and price targets at 700-1000

What ever happened to that guy who became millionaire from GME? Is he still diamond handing this?
Man i should've
First you give it, then you take it
Because guys like me will throw some dick their way
Lolol are you a billionaire yet, son ?
Just a heads up to all my fake broker brothers. I was early assigned on a SPY 370 short call (part of a spread) late Thursday night which I did not have the funds to cover. I was unable to CLOSE out of all of my other existing credit spreads while under the maintenance call. I got a hold of RH support (which is actually really good now) They bought back the 100 shares of SPY (which at this time was under 370 so the position made a profit) guess who keeps that profit? RH, not you. I took screen recordings of me trying to CLOSE out of my positions and kept getting an error message saying you can't do this. They said that was because I was in a maintenance call. Well guess what, that is very wrong, especially because I have collateral to cover those spreads as RH makes you do. I am escalating the case because those credit spreads went against me before I could close and I am demanding compensation. Don't let RH tell you "it is what it is" FINRA is on our side and I am telling them that this offense is very much worthy of a FINRA complaint. 
TL:DR If you're in a maintenance/margin call don't wait for RH to take action. Get a hold of their support ASAP and have them exercise/buy back short shares because even though they say you can close positions, you can not.
This is the way
I agree with you on a lot of things but saying TSLA is the only profitable car manufacturer in the world is laughable. They aren‚Äôt even a car manufacturer. They‚Äôre a tech company. They aren‚Äôt profitable selling cars. Only reason they‚Äôre in the green is from selling carbon credits.

No, it's not legal, but I wouldn't doubt if the same activities ceased to exist.
We see a lot of the TSLA millionaire stories, where people loaded up for a year or more on shares/calls and it paid off.   Don't see too many of the stories of people doing the same on the wrong stock and losing it or at least not making that much off of it.  I suspect there are a lot more of those stories out there.
They can't show off their personality (said 50% sarcastically) so they're using the one asset they think people want.

Yes. I think the end game though will not be the falling dollar but rising bond yields. If demand suddenly goes away for bonds the scheme is up.....powell can always up his bond purchases but that in turn requires more debt ... its really a nightmare when u think about it.. if there is another major slow down or inflationary shock to the economy at all in the next 1-2 years there will be a major market meltdown. Way worse than the summer because the fed will be helpless because the dollar will either collapse or go on a moon mission that will make all the debt created a serious existential threat to the world economy.

Closing price was 695
Your 680 would not have been filled if there wasn't a 695 _before/at_ the close.

I explained in my previous post how the closing price is determined and that explains why you were filled.

The shady part is how price went instantaneously from the mid 660s to 695 only to set the close price, just to screw all the passive funds that must buy the closing price, and immediately carried on at 670 at 4:00:01 after hours.

I saw it with my own eyes, and my wife was next to me and saw it too. I use ibkr if it makes a difference, not sure about other peoples price feed.

In any case congrats to you and everyone who made good money out of tesla. I just think it's a prime example of a stock that has been manipulated to different ends over the months, from ridiculous analyst ratings right before the s&p inclusion to major stakeholders offloading right before the previous S&p rejection and all other short of shenanigans. It's just a good reminder what retail investors are up against.

Just bought a Kia Minivan with my trading profits!!!

Yesterday went to the dealer and bought a 2018 Kia Minivan (s)EX trim with trading profits from this year. It's a Christmas surprise present for my wife‚Äôs boyfriend. I'm not telling her or him about it, but it's hard to keep the secret because I'm so excited, so I figured I'd tell you degenerates.

This was my first profitable year since I started trading/investing in 2017. I was down 35k at one point, but managed to make it back and then get in the green by about 6k. DM me if you want to ask more about it or get my wife‚Äôs number.
Nah, RH don't have paper trading.

is solar winds a good buy for next week? There's no such thing as bad publicity right?
You could exercise a call if it was at $25 and the strike price was $31. Not sure why you would, but you can.
Very cool, do you have a github account with any of the code?
It‚Äôll never happen, it‚Äôs unnecessary.
Your post is so full of holes it might as well be Swiss cheese.

In what world could you possibly think that TSLA is the only profitable car maker in the world? This is just asinine
Sounds like you have no idea about there direction of the company and why the stores closing are a good thing.
maybe it's just comfortable and easier

Don't doubt ur vibe.
Look I'm as smooth brained as it gets and yes I've short sold TSLA and gotten my ass handed to me before, but I don't think I've ever seen a more obvious top than the blow off top in volume we saw with inclusion yesterday. Technically, this turd just finished it's fifth wave on record breaking volume. More shares were traded than SPY traded at the heights of March. There is no earnings story that can justify this. There cannot be enough new buyers to sustain this valuation and everyone and their dad will be selling out of this obvious top. This is 1999 Yahoo, post S&P inclusion. If I has more than like 3$ I would go all in puts and preorder my Lambo. Yes I await your downvotes you fuckin degenerates

It absolutely is and I‚Äôve had the same thoughts. All i told myself is that a tunnel is not never ending and if i just stick my goals i‚Äôll pop out the other side at some point. May be tomorrow, may be next month, may be ten years from now, but i‚Äôll pop out. Seriously try setting a goal and put all your energy into it ‚Äî you‚Äôll be shocked how fast time flies and how occupied your mind becomes. You seem like a smart guy ‚Äî don‚Äôt waste that away. You can use that to be so much better than anyone who may have thought they were better than you. Enjoy these holidays even if you‚Äôre alone. Use the time to start thinking and planning your next play. I believe in you, man! For real. You‚Äôll be out of the tunnel quicker than you think.

Oh sorry are you referring to ETFs as ‚Äúbenchmark funds‚Äù? No one I know calls them Benchmark funds. I‚Äôve never heard anyone call them that. An Index is a Benchmark. So youre saying the same thing. 

But to your point. Yes, ETFs don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave‚Äù to do anything. They could have been buying Tesla for months now for all we know, your investment thesis is that they waited until the biggest purchaser had to buy to get in? Why the hell would they do that?

Yes you‚Äôre right on an absolute number basis there are more individual ETFs than index funds, but the AUM isn‚Äôt close. 

There‚Äôs ~$4bn in the SP500 index funds alone. That‚Äôs close to the entire number of all ETFs combined. 

Unless you think the ETFs are trying to make lower returns than the indexes, I don‚Äôt know why they would buy on Monday
I was reading this and I thought; okay not bad selling at the top, maybe they have like 300 shares or something.

Is there any major industry, large businesses, factories in the area, or is it close to a major city? If it is there's always going to be people who might need a house or are looking to upgrade.

The way I see it is that if the property is in the middle of no where it better have a lot of acres attached to it and/or have a really good view, if it doesn't have either of those it's worthless.

Somethings wrong with the math on this because in June 2017 Tesla stock was $67 now it‚Äôs $670ish so according to my computer would only be sitting on 10X his investment of $10,000 and after further calculations on my computer that works out to something but not $1M
I plan on holding for years, so I know I shouldn't time it but I feel like a slight pullback is due since it ran from 30s to 80s so quickly.  But I'll probably just buy some more this week and on any dips.

Are Thiel and Palantirs other high ranking employees going to dump their shares in a nearly two decade long pet project in order to make a quick buck, or is he going to keep them in expectation of further growth?  It would be like Elon offloading all his Tesla shares the instant it went public and then moving to Miami to fuck pornstars off his $500 million payout, or Bill Gates using his charity as a front to fuck African prostitutes tax free. 

There might be a big price dip as some of these shares get sold, but this is a long term project built up over decades, not a cash grab by Theil. Everyone that works there is rich already, Theil could be getting his dick sucked by 18 year old male models the rest of his life, but what people at this level get off on is building things, big things. Money for them isn‚Äôt the object it is for you or I. They could get money any way they choose, but what they do beyond making money is the fun part. 

Palantir has a product with nearly limitless of applications, and they‚Äôve been following a very traditional model of starting with big sales, in this case the government, and slowly working their way into public sector markets. I think that the IPO is just the start of a long term expansion now that the flagship software is fully developed and in use by plenty of customers.
You don't know the difference between revenue and profit. Or how Geek Squad works.

Far from it: I honestly don't want us GME gang to become an echo chamber and I'm always glad to see opposing views, whether I agree or disagree with them. I realize that this is risky bet which may go bust at any point leaving tons of retards here penniless

However, recently I've started noticing accounts repeating same old shit, never addressing any of the bullish thesis points, just plain "fuck this company buy puts". They contribute literally nothing and my gut feeling is they are shilling for their short position. We have at least one confirmation with a guy writing on seeking alpha about how trash the company is and then crying on his personal twitter that his short position is bleeding. I suspect there are more of them.

First set up some ground rules/facts for yourself; 

- How much fluctuation in price can you handle? 
- Know your stocks (is the company suddenly bad because it dropped 10%?)
- Make an exit plan if you're just riding a stock to a certain % up. Get out at that price and don't fret the potential what ifs. Opportunity is eternal.
- If you made a bad call (no research, fomo, etc) be able to admit that to yourself and cut your losses and move on.
- Just because someone says "this is the next big thing" doesn't actually make it the next big thing, even if their DD post is very compelling. Do yourself a favor and investigate before committing to buy something.

Their annual revenue is 5x more the value of fastly... i dont know why everyone hates on csco. Its a huge profitable  company with the cleanest balance sheet and a growing dividend. Its not flashy and wont double or triple in a few months but it ain‚Äôt going to 0 no matter what. During the pandemic fastly was 12 dollars a share and probably would have gone under if not for the fed.

Damn I was hoping I would keep trading up to better brokerages by default lol I started with scottrade then they got bought out by TD. Guess I‚Äôll have to actually look for a better one now
I have to admit that the current P/S is even in the SaaS sector very high, but thats because there is a lot of trust and high expectation of the company. A lot depends on next earnings quarter. However if you are determined to hold it for a longer time span it doesnt really matter if you bought at 75, 80 or 85.

Upfront cost, taxes, more risk buying shares in this scenario. 2023 could either be a massive lotto pay out or OP avoided owning the shares and only being exposed to your premium cost going to 0. If their leaks go ITM they could roll PMCC‚Äôs off of it for more downside protection through the course of the option. Basically it comes down to flexibility.

Selling covered calls is one of the safest, consistent money you can make in the market, and you're literally holding the golden ticket with the highest premiums. If you take any advice from this sub let it be this. **look into selling covered calls**
How has no one on this sub been talking about ENPH?
Still can't understand what the hell the movement in the last 10 minutes were and that insane pump? Forget TSLA, all the indexes followed. 

Wtf was that?
I laughed my ass off at that part
Further: "how big of a dip do we need to have for people to have a panic?" do you mean total loss of confidence in the stock markets ability to "only go up"? As we had in 2008? I would argue 2008 is a special case, and i don't see anything similar happening structurally.

Yes, my investments are big business and I‚Äôm well known in the business industry for my success. But I must ask you my friend, I must ask you for $2000 cash so I can invest for you. I don‚Äôt want to keep my investing expertise to myself anymore and want to help others üòé
What was the other BS besides the IPO and all the üåà üêª trying to short? Since Sept 30 this bad boy has beat all expectations and is so far proven to be able take a punch. Yes a dip here and there but c'mon man this thing is just getting started
Still waiting for this stock to blow up in just days time. Literally every day there's some retard on here screeching about how if you don't buy this stock now, your wife's boyfriend is going to be laughing at you from across the dinner table as he plays with his Rolex because he bought in early.  This has been a weekly occurrence for the last month and I have yet to see it break 33.50*
The problem is the competition in the space. By the time Tesla is able to it, others will have either beaten them to it or will be a year or two away. They won't have a monopoly on self driving tech in the same way they do with electric car tech.

Bro, just quit your job and trade full-time. It's totally worth it unless you are a full retard.
I spent some time looking into getting solar panels for my home and, from what I've seen, power walls aren't economical for most homes. Makes more sense to just have the solar panels power you during the day (when electricity is more expensive) and pay for electricity at night (when electricity is cheaper).

That could change in the future but the cost of the power wall would have to go down significantly. The thing costs like 12k after installation. It's hard for it to pay for itself when it costs that much.
Could be... but [maybe not](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2EbQFlTl/). Signs are [pointing up](https://imgur.com/a/C6WXKad).

I have been trying to find my balls and buy Puts for next summer. Thinking it is going to start breaking down in the next couple of weeks but don't know how much hype Elon can continue to generate now that it is in the SP 500 that may be enough institutional to steady and slow any downward pressure.

So I have been sitting on the sidelines wishing I hadn't over thought my buying it when it went below 400 a month or so ago.

Isn‚Äôt it pretty well know that buying puts is way riskier than buying calls in a bull market? If you‚Äôre just starting out in options why not move with the market?
Everyone is in but how much of that is fueled by changes in technology? Stocks used to be boring until robinhood gave everyone and their mother access from their mobile phones. Agreed it feels like euphoria but it‚Äôs also a rise in democratized investing / gambling and it will only continue. The issue as you noted is that young people haven‚Äôt lived through a tech market bubble or a 9/11 yet. Fruition of risk is the best teacher of investing and most here I bet haven‚Äôt learned it. Point is stocks are becoming mainstream and that is more good than bad but the fundamentals of risk based investing still hold true.

When buying calls you never really want to buy any expiring within the next 30 days (right?) but for puts it's wiser to have more long term expirations?

They do all the time. It's a stupid justification but there are legitimately people out there that think a 1T valuation is still low for it. This is one of the most irrational markets In history

The days are still young. You have time.
I agree with what you guys are saying 100%.  ABBV and BMY are both solid companies.... however OP coining big pharma stocks as the ‚Äú next breakthrough stocks‚Äù is just unrealistic .

It‚Äôs equivalent to calling a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù large tech stock like CSCO (which has a 200 billion market cap) the next breakthrough cyber security tech stock.  Decent company, however something that large is never mooning / never is going to give you ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äùreturns .

I think a lot of wsb just looks at share price being low as = moon potential ... versus looking at market cap.
He was going to do it anyways. That was the final straw. He did it moments later. And then people say it's the brokers fault. It's the peoples fault who are uneducated

In the end money is nothing really. Do you think on your deathbed you'll be stressing that you didn't make an extra $100k that one time? That you never became a millionaire?

As long as you make enough to live in comfort, be grateful for everything else you have; your health, family and friends and pets that love you, and your ability to sustain your lifestyle with what you already have; you'll live a great life.

Elon playing everyone for fools. His tweet ""I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house" actually meant "I am selling my house in California so I can evade state income tax"
I would tend to agree except.. it was EY who was their auditor when the fraud happened sooo.. the big 4 might not be the best option either. 

That said, it‚Äôs def a risk/reward situation so perfect for WSB
They can spin like a driedel  on your pecker

The product will live on, and I want to hop on that while its cheap from moron abuse. I know it‚Äôs heavy speculation, but I want to explore the idea at least for now
Wait what happened?
they are valuing it like its the next apple ...which is not unreasonable
works for me, I'm seeing no 502

The market is always neutral. There is always an opposite end of the trade. Tesla valued at $mil per car.   There can only be one winner. It‚Äôs not a matter of who will win. It‚Äôs a matter of when will the shorts win. That‚Äôs the million dollar question. There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty going on. I would tread carefully.
I don‚Äôt care how they make money
So puts it is
you're absolutely retarded if you think that's the only thing baked into the valuation

Listen retards and Autistic. GME is not above 20 because the company is dying off. Want insider info on it?  Talk to your kids or anyone else who you know that games. Their old favorite store is obsolete. These nerds can buy all the games straight off the system they are playing in now. They can get all all the new controllers and accessories from amazon without leveling off couch. And the one thing that they need game stop for (they new systems) game stop can even get proper supply to sell them so they will probably get it from Walmart or Best Buy. If you are I invested with ral money that you actually care about more then karma in this company take it out and put it somewhere eles. There is a reason that this stock was bottoming out before the ps5 fomo took hold

The Fed = Corporate Socialism
This time truly is different. Never before have so many tax payer dollars been used to pay for corporate and real estate insolvency, not to mention unemployment and other stimulus. Once this feeding cycle ends, and it will, you‚Äôre going to see a serious correction.  Demand for continued support is increasing almost exponentially and you know what that means.

Pure speculation but I have a feeling next few IPOs are going to be pretty bumpy. I could see the banks ramping up the price at IPO then dumping because they know (and it‚Äôs pretty popular now) that IPOs are way over priced.

So I'm gonna guess that you haven't reviewed the evidence whatsoever?

TSLA will probably peak to $1T and drop down back to 600-700B.  The game changer would be autonomous driving.

Index funds are the ones that have to buy at close because they are trying to match. Benchmark funds can buy anytime and don't have to buy at all. But if the price drops lower than close on inclusion then they would be getting free alpha since they would be beating s&p price which is their goal. Keep in mind there are more benchmark funds than index funds.

Anyway, just started trading like a fucking addict this year. Now I wake up at 3:59am no matter what and check premarket for 1 hour before going back to sleep. Except on the weekends where my body lets me sleep for 14 hours.

TLDR: Sleep all weekend; Gamble all Week

You know why its called a Put? Because you might as well Put that money in a trash can and set it on fire.
There should also be some liquidity codes indicating how you got filled (added liquidity, removed, routed to BATS, etc) and one of the codes is ‚Äúauction‚Äù. Depending on your broker it might be hard to find that though

So your theory is all the indexers didn‚Äôt do the *One* thing they were supposed to do on Friday?

They have one job to do every ~3 months, and they just didn‚Äôt do it this time because they didn‚Äôt feel like it?
if its getting added on Monday probably have already bought and secured shares. now I wonder how what the next play is for money managers to beat the index.

It‚Äôs scary and the situation is as tight as a nun‚Äôs ass but there is one thing that keeps me a bit cool here: inflation. We keep on printing and no fucking inflation...there is a lot of trust in the system and little alternative to the current system. As long as ppl want dollars, pounds, euros, yen, swiss francs, we should be cool. As long as ppl build shit and accept paper money for it we are cool. Keep an eye on inflation, it‚Äôs a silent killer. PS: the entire information/hybrid war propagated  by Russia and others, i believe it‚Äôs exactly about this, destroy the trust we have built over the last 70 years. We need to stay sharp, keep the shit going no matter what. Fuck yeah

The official ‚Äúclose‚Äù price for each stock (that you see in yahoo finance, in your brokerage, etc) is the price where the closing auction cleared. That price was 695, therefore it seems _extremely_ likely that this was how you got filled, especially since your limit was 684 and under any other circumstance if your order didn‚Äôt immediately get filled at placement it would be filled at 684.

I like bounce music, some include Will Sparks, Timmy Trumpet, Bek and Wallin, Deorro.  I also like hardstyle, Showtek has really good hardstyle songs from back in the day.

There's tons of others, I usually just YouTube hop from song to song and find new ones that I like based on their suggestions or similar artists
Why is everyone into the market vs real estate? Liquidity has come a long way, MUCH lower capital barrier to entry, securitization, slicing and dicing everything into bite size pieces further improves accessibility of investments, houses are the investing equivalent of being forced to trade BRK.A... yeah, nobody would be able to do that, it's the same thing. Laziness: laziness is a big factor, if people will pay the equivalent of purchase price to get McDonalds delivered to their door, what makes you think they're going to buy a house and do the hard work of paint shit, renovate shit? Hell no. This society is by far the laziest.

There was an old joke at Microsoft back in the early-mid 90‚Äôs... the parking lot was full of million dollar 5-series BMWs and Porsches. So many employees sold early to buy things.

Yeah why aren't people taking reference from the first few weeks of trading history after it went public. It was downtrending when the insiders' were able to unload their first 20%. That time the share price was only $9-11. 

The upcoming lockup expiry will allow them to sell remaining 80% and the share price is alrdy almost 200% higher from the initial price. I think it'll also have some downwards price movement shortly before the lockup expiry date as other investors would likely wanna cash out rather than sit through such volatile periods.

I'm long PLTR and looking forward to loading up when that time comes.

Long-time contributor here. I know we joke about this topic and generally laugh it down, but it is concerning how everyone-and-their-mother is into stocks rn. Think about it. I'll spare you the 1920s reference, but I wonder how much more \*emotional\* it makes market swings, when almost everyone from your 20s fry-cook / warehouser to college students, HS students, super old people, are now into the market moreso than ever before. 

Historically, boomers weren't like this. They played property. It ALWAYS worked for them. I feel like that bequeathed a degree of stability to the system. 

1. How big of a dip do we need to have for people to have a panic? 
2. Is it a \*bad\* thing for growth that everyone is in the market? One could argue this simply is adding more capital to the system, but its already flush with capital. 
3. Does the stock market now constitute a social safety net for non-retired Americans? Honest question. In China, it already does--which is why the Party is reluctant to let it crash, as it becomes a stability(security) issue then. If the stock market is politically important to <99%'ers now, perhaps its a \*\*good\*\* thing, as Politicians will be evermoreso motivated to keep the bubble going.

People are going to mob theaters and restaurants once herd immunity is reached, so I think that will make AMC go way up in the short term, at which point I would sell off my shares.

Nobody said you have to fill it with valuable shit either. I discovered that I like sports and Stephen A Smith, and that's the biggest shittiest waste of time ever but I like it. Go lowbrow while you still can! Or highbrow or midbrow if that's also a thing.

I recommend Slobby Robby and Rust Valley Restorers for trashy reality shows, Letterkenny for quality and inoffensive Canadian humor (humour?), and Remi Wolf for weird popular alternative music. Also watch anything narrated by David Attenborough, when that man dies the world will forever be a little less bright. Birds are fuckin cool man.

I'm sure some NPs are highly trained and capable. Perhaps you're the one that's ignorant or unwilling to consider that there is a trend of poorly equipped  NPs being put in positions they aren't capable of handling

If I go in to an ER or urgent care and someone introduces themselves as a doctor, I assume they are a medical doctor. What is now happening is someone can go straight from BSN to a 3 year online DNP program (from degree mills with 100% acceptance rate). Sorry if I doubt the ability of a graduate of Chamberlain University to recognize the difference between the onset of a life threatening condition and the flu, which is what has happened in some cases. There is a legislative push to give more autonomy to these NPs

Copying my response from another post.

My biggest issue was easily risk management. I was selling a shitload of naked calls on tesla, which worked well for a few months, then got my ass handed to me. Another huge mental thing is your reference point for gains. If you're on here constantly, your reference point might be that anything under six figure gains is Jack shit. This is something I'm still working on, I'm just addicted to reading this sub for entertainment. But it fucks with your mentality towards YOUR money that you've worked your fucking ass off for, in most cases. 

I trimmed my portfolio down a bit and really watched and learned how the positions move, allowing me to time my theta plays better, this has helped me a fucking ton! No shiny ball syndrome, that will pound your butthole eventually, and bleed your account. 

This is a LONG game. There is no free lunch, and seeing the lotto winners here all the time can be dangerous, as it tricks you into thinking that is the norm. It's not. Lastly, and this is the hardest for me, stick to your fucking plan! Control your emotions, write down your exit strategy for all positions. Best and worst case. We are hard wired to gamble more when facing losses, and cut our winners early. This game is a fickle bitch, and your mind is your biggest enemy. I HIGHLY recommend a book called Thinking Fast and Slow. It's incredible and will really challenge the way your think about your decision making and intuition.

Now that the SP excitement is over, it's on to next drivers of "value." There are many, but not next week. I think we see a 10% drop at least in the next week as people/funds look to book wins as the year winds down. TSLA will moon again, but it has to stall a little bit first.

So let me get this straight .. you're comparing the original model S? The one that came out in like what, 2009? Just because you kind of sound like a dick...

The original Model S cost about $55-60k. A Mercedes S class would cost about $90k. So you're wrong about price. Also, even though the price hasn't come down the car has gotten substantially better over the past 10 years. Name me another carmaker who manufactures (by your definition) a luxury style EV, with autopilot capabilities that compares to the Mercedes S class, but at half the cost? Ok now name one that's been on the market for the past decade... üòÇüòÇ

When pltr first IPO, the first week saw heavy selling and the stock price went from $11+ to $8.90. That's only with 20% insider shares being unlocked. Can't imagine what will happen when the remaining 80% gets unleashed but I seriously don't think it will go up during that period.
Check again on RH. It says option expired for me this morning. Stupid RH
Bullshit.  It happens all the time, and there's nothing the SEC can do about it.  I mean if you get caught making up rumors, that's one thing, but you can manipulate the price all day.  You just have one of your analysts write a report that your fund thought it was best to go long here, and sell there because of some bla bla bla, and who can argue?  They can't prove you did it with the intention of manipulating price, and even if they could, the punishments are so light it's still profitable.

Roblox got shelved for next year and was shit all over.  CEO got greedy man, after seeing how much DASH and BNB got paid from stupid people.  ...also something about making sure his employees can't sell their options.  It will be a dirty, dirty IPO and I don't think nearly as much value exists with it anymore.  There are financial institutions who are just waiting for us to pull it for them so they can rug pull.  The way it is being implied is that the IPO will only benefit the executives, early investors and the Board (mostly all the same thing).
The headline makes it seem like he gave away a million dollars to the most loyal Elon fanboys. 

I'm just dumb.

PLTR top line growth isn‚Äôt that impressive when you consider their valuation. What is interesting is growing at a 50% clip after 17 years in business. What is the moat they were building all this time? Government relationships? Was that an effective way to spend that time? I kind of think Thiel had the whole nationalism craze in mind after 9/11 and built this to support defense but then realized it had huge commercial use case. If that is the case, it‚Äôs like investing in a 17 year old start up lol. I‚Äôm long but not convinced this is a all in yolo situation that so many others are considering.

If the underlying closed between the strikes and it wasn't closed you'd have to be assigned, all brokerages do this type of risk management. I've had this happen on put credit spreads before on day of expiration and immediately changed my strategy to not hold credit spreads to expiration. Feel for you but. Yea. Can't blame the brokerage on a possible 5.3 million bet that 50/50 could go bad for them.

I watched him for about 15 minutes waiting for my table for a business dinner. He wasn't even paying attention to the game, just "passing the time" until a football game started.

He was playing $10,000/hand.

I think a lot of permabulls don't understand just how hard puts print when shit goes down. The default is up, so calls are expensive. Puts are cheap, until they are suddenly very expensive.

Yes, markets usually go up. But with calls, one bad day will wipe out a month of gains. With puts, one good day will wipe out a month of losses.

I am usually a bear, trying to time tops. I can be wrong 10 times and be right once, and I'll still be profitable.

If you have a job it‚Äôs not much. If you have a low paying job it‚Äôs welcomed. If you are unemployed it‚Äôs insufficient. If you are unemployed with a family it‚Äôs an absolute slap in the face. This wouldn‚Äôt even cover utilities for a month. Shit 1200 6 months ago was a joke (fortunately they raised unemployment benefits). 

Targeted relief would make more sense. Give it to people who need it so it could be more and more impactful. 

Sounds like you need it. Is $600 going to save you over the next 6 months? Or just make this month a little more tolerable? The point being this is a very short term solution to a long term problem. The politicians will act like they helped while millions are suffering in extreme poverty. When really the help was very little for those who need it and will be YOLO‚Äôd by those who don‚Äôt.

Not a great answer, I know, but *it depends*.

If you lost your job today, how long would it take to find a replacement? Would you be employed again tomorrow? Next week? Next month? What is the longest you might be without a regular income?

You're probably fine with $10K. You want enough that if things go south, you know you can pay rent/mortgage and other expenses until you are pulling in guaranteed income week over week - without having to make decisions with your brokerage account that are counter to your investment philosophies. 

But it also depends on your risk level and \*ahem\* the risk level of your family. For example, I would be fine with $10K, but my wife's risk tolerance is low. She wants a $20K cushion. The trick to that is to let her manage it in her savings account. Because if I see it regularly sitting there doing nothing, it will make me more than a little crazy. I know it's there, but I don't have to see it. And it's worth the extra $10K to not have her worry. Sigh.

Thank you.  I actually was wondering if you could message me privately about what you think of all my dd that i post, bc I need it to boost my self confidence.
My goal is to just buy future oriented stocks. Some meme stocks are, like Tesla, but other's are just just shitty poorly-managed old-companies that happen to have some slightly positive news. Now they're probably worth slightly more than their original value, but after the pump they are almost always overvalued.
This is the way!! üôåüèª
Out of genuine curiosity, why‚Äôs that? 

A lot of my positions were held for at least a week, some a little more. I look at a squeeze forming, look back at a similar squeeze, measure the move and calculate how long it takes to get there and then sell PCS based on that. It‚Äôs a calculated move on my part so I don‚Äôt tie up my funds longer than necessary waiting on theta decay and risking a potential reversal.

i disagree. the $1200 check was the big market booster in the previous act. also cash to citizens is certainly a much better way to boost the unemployed rather than giving money to the already employed, no? sure some small businesses will use it to retain employees, but only a very small percentage of them will use it to actually hire anybody else

Since you asked, Monday we open up bigly with stimmy and bank news driving markets to ATH then a slow fade but still hold the gains. Tuesday we open little red but that quickly gets eaten up and we finish green again.  Wednesday and Thursday have no volume and markers don‚Äôt budge.

When asked whether bullish or bearish on the market, Taleb said he didn't understand the question. Positions or ban, they said, and he said that he had bought puts. So, you are bearish? You think the market will go down? No, it will probably go up a little bit, said Taleb. Then why did you buy puts? they asked.

The market is more likely to go up, but it is preferable still to short it, because in the event of it going down, it could go down a lot, answered Taleb.

Or worst case lockdowns become the norm with ‚Äúnew strains‚Äù out and vaccines taking longer to take effect. I think we are still in the beginning of a new 20 year cycle.
Eventually, probably. They have had several test flights in multiple platforms to date. BUT this company is always behind the power curve, missing deadline after deadline. 

If your long in SPCE just know it‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride. Delays are the norm. Maybe it helps in the safety front but does not help investor confidence. But neither would a ship blowing up so there‚Äôs that..
When my XPEV bull call spreads inevitably hit max profit I‚Äôll turn $15k into $60k. Then, I‚Äôll roll that into a PLTR, EV, ARK portfolio maybe 50:50 stonks and calls to turn that into $150k in 2021.

Who the fuck ever liked shopping at GME?  Ever?  These guys think that they can force a short squeeze.  Even if they can, only like half of them will see any profit.  And now, according to u/gardeeon, the shorts are rolling out, a portion at a time.  Which will prevent a dramatic squeeze, but could make for some steady growth for a couple of months before it falls again.
You mean the companies that all failed to detect the breaches which is literally the only reason they exist?
That is top notch retardism. Congratulations.
No worries. They paid the SEC $65 million to keep it hush-hush. You, on the other hand, will never see a penny of that $65 million. Enjoy!
I have 30k. Could be a bit less but I'll probably just use some of that for taxes instead so I don't have to touch my darling rh account

Blah blah, all of that is speculation. It‚Äôs obviously clear they‚Äôre working to get it legalized.
Something tells me this isn't a high up employee but instead was charged in an effort to have him flip on the higher ups.
I traded slob recently it‚Äôs definitely a trade because it‚Äôs so volatile but small enough to where it can move a lot and make you a lot of money for taking on the risk..i still like the major producers better because of the etf and index exposure that I think will be big going into the next few weeks , but good luck with slb .
The S&P doesn‚Äôt buy anything, it‚Äôs the fund which replicate the S&P 500 that buy stocks
NKLA had the same thing. On a stock that should have been dumped and it barely moved an inch.

Absolutely no way employees all dump their stock. Most people arnt gamblers like WSB and likely are holding long term.
As someone who is active in the adult diaper community and partakes in public messing, I gotta say you're misunderstanding the situation.

Has it happened to me? no, but I've heard many a tale
Soooooooooooooo boooooooooooooooorrrrrrred
What dip? Also fuck FB!
Okay guys, what do we think about cyber security stocks? Whose the best plays??
AH closed under 690 so you're probably fine. If you would have been assigned you'd have a notification by now given options are exercised on Saturday.

It's usually around noon on Saturday but if it cleared your dashboard already you should be fine.

Also given the volatility I'm surprised you held. Buy to close next time least you get fucked by AH.

Tons of tsla will trade hands cuz all these 650c to 670c  ended the trading day while bid/ask didn't reflect the volatile close to $695. You can bet those will be exercised.
3 of those dimensions you might blow up your account and never recover . 1 you get mad f*ing tendies.
I have 10k too in a money market but interest rates are .2% on it now so I‚Äôm thinking about moving 5k into my brokerage
I fucked up the title, whoops.
52 week low has not been reached, much less 50%. Check your charts.
A shoulder to cry on?
QQQ and QQQJ are worth a look too. 

With tsla inclusion no one knows how it will behave in the long run and some of the ark funds are tsla heavy.

Now that‚Äôs a bull if I‚Äôve ever seen one
I have feeling if 2020 wasn't a great year for a person in the market they should think about other ways to make money.
I did this too but my limit order was for $690 and got filled at $695. Super dope but I want to buy back in after the dip as well. Hopefully it comes.

Not entirely true, but I agree to an extent.

All government customers have been issued disconnect orders.

The company itself will continue to burn, but the products will not die. Just as those in the industry have known checkpoint by a plethora of names, Orion and others will trade hands the same.

SolarWinds is not too big to fail and products can easily change hands.
Itll be open during trading hours and after hours for international markets.

Holy shit. The sad part is that people did actually pay to hear someone say these general ass statements lol
Quite possibly.  If you go to balances, you can check your cash and sweep vehicle balance.  If you got assigned, it's probably significantly negative.  You should also have 100 TSLA shares showing in your account.

This is something I find to be true. If I see a DD or TA in here that's riddled with spelling and grammatical errors I'm less likely to regard what's being said with any weight. If you cant be bothered to use words correctly, why would I conclude your skills of deduction and logic to be anything *but* something that you also dont put much effort into?
I've seen this same DD like 100 times and the thing all the smart   fucks say is they locked in annual contracts on most first time buyers so revenue is locked in for about another 3-6 months. It was something like that but I'm fuckin retarded and broke my fuckin kitchen range yesterday so don't listen to me. That is all.

I have a feeling that stocks will continue to move left to right. But I could be wrong.

You‚Äôre counting all the standalone BBY Mobile stores as closures when it was really a shift in the industry.  People stopped buying cell phones as regularly when installment billing became a thing, and not enough people went to those stores to justify their expenses (which were primarily in malls).


You‚Äôre probably right about the stock, but profits were continually growing year over year before Covid...  mostly because of the focus on subscriptions, services, and in home sales.
you're getting downvoted but ur not wrong lmfao.
I could. But am I gonna?
I bought puts seconds before the drop and made a quick 100%. Even when the big Shrek dick happened and market closed I'm up 10%.
PLTR will go up and down and i will ride the upswings from bottoms daily.

The option is cleared off my dashboard and shows up in my history as ‚Äúremoval of option due to expiration‚Äù.   Does that mean it‚Äôs definitely not being exercised?   Thanks autists.

Oh yeah my b that‚Äôs what I meant. The shit at the end of games that ends it, been awhile since I watched a game lol
Nice. I just have like 5k left in my PUA balance to get through before the 28th in case they don‚Äôt extend or else I don‚Äôt get it.
Thanks. I am looking to make at least 20,000 on this play. How close to the money would you go on AMD?

$600 stim isn't shit the markets are better off with "stimulus talks going well" speculation rather than that abortion of a stim getting passed
Nobody screwed anyone over, yes I watched it and traded it.

When the imbalance came out at 350 it was billions of dollars to buy for TSLA of course it ran up and printed the high. This is the biggest imbalance I've seen in the 3 years I've been trading by at least 4x. If you want to talk about manipulation the shakeout into 350 is way more suss than it running up into the close and printing the high.

You keep talking about this flashed order. It isn't true there was no flashed order above 680 before the closing print. I had an order to sell at 680 that I put out in the last minute and I got filled the 695 price.

First of all, no one in here is tying to have rational valuation discussions.

Second of all, if you don't think being first mover with a fully autonomous fleet of robotaxis will completely disrupt personal transportation, you're fooling yourself and lack vision

Third of all, everyone and their grandma knows that Tesla is supremely overvalued. Everything's supremely overvalued look around.

No one cares about value here. People are trying to make money. You seem to have a fascination with investing. That's great, subreddit is that way ->

I was losing a bunch of money day trading options, so figured I‚Äôd buy a late January call and just let it marinate. Long story short, Instead of losing $2,500 in two days, I‚Äôve lost it in two weeks! I‚Äôve cracked the code, boys.

Lol, tesla could issue shares to buy ford, toyota, and GM at this point. imagine if wallstreetbets buying rampant calls for the last year and the wallstreetbet boomers buying up shares is what allows tesla to raise enough capital to expand to the entire planet and grow its manufacturing exponentially. that would really be something

Stock is down nearly 50% already, unless it‚Äôs going bankrupt I think you may have better luck betting in the opposite direction
Yeah their top line growth isn‚Äôt that impressive when you consider valuation. What is interesting is growing at a 50% clip after 17 years in business. What is the moat they were building all this time? Government relationships? Was that an effective way to spend that time? I kind of think Thiel had the whole nationalism craze in mind after 9/11 and built this to support defense but then realized it had huge commercial use case. If that is the case, it‚Äôs like investing in a 17 year old start up lol. I‚Äôm long but not convinced this is a all in yolo situation that so many others are considering.

Just jump off something bro, can you imagine the rush?
Which banks? Thanks
You have to assume anyone with lots of shares locked up, particularly the employees and founders are not going to dump all their shares after lock up expires.  Why dump for $30 or less when you can cash in shares $30 and above over a 5-10 year period.  

If the plan is to dump all the shares and run, as connected as these guys are, particularly Theil, then that doesn't bode well for the rest of the market.
Sorry.  I edited and cleaned up the post
oh yea, it is. fixed it

Doggo sad.
My friend who obsesses on tesla stock told me in the morning that the sell-off would occur after 1 or 2est, most likely, and that the large funds would begin their buy in after that, so at least in my own little perspective, it followed the trail of the advice given to me.
yah thats my concern now. hmmmmmmmmmmm
It will either give a couple more tendies Monday or crash tremendously. I wouldn't expect the same spike to carry over a weekend.
WSB OGs. I have 300,000 to YOLO on Monday. I would like advice on a play for next week. I trade weeklies only. Also only do cash secured puts and covered calls. High risk tolerance but not reckless. Advice on a high reward play expiry 12/24 would be appreciated.
Assuming TSLA will not go down after the move yesterday is like betting 20 on roulette, landing it, betting it again, landing it again, betting 20 again, landing 20 for the 4th time, and then betting 20 again.

What I mean is, 4 20's has retard strength. You might be right about all this, Buttaman, but this is a casino.
Nice! Picked up 500 shares earlier in the week üöÄüöÄ
what's there to do during the weekends?
But that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, I want to spike the ball and end the game. 

And the bad thing is I‚Äôm wildly successful compared to what younger me wanted. Married with a loving wife, 6 figure salary, 2/3 thru a masters, well respected at work, paid off house and 100k portfolio. 

What concerns me is none of that matters much to me, and if that doesn‚Äôt matter will I ever be happy?  I‚Äôve always believed life is inherently meaningless and you‚Äôve got to create that meaning, but I‚Äôve created the meaning I thought I wanted and I‚Äôm not happy.

I want to have faith in Intel, but I can't see them ever making a meaningful recovery from this. Even if they did get a government contract that would be nothing compared to the market share that they used to have. They were literally the best silicon company for years and now that they allowed their competitors to catch up they will probably never return to dominate the market again. Why?

Their main product the x86 chipset is becoming obsolete and it's being replaced by ARM.  I'm not an expert on the industry, but I listen to enough people who are and they can't stop talking about it. Eventually the overall market share for x86 will be reduced. I believe that x86 processors will be phased out in servers due to the cost savings of running ARM processors instead, so Intel and AMD will eventually lose this market. 

Currently, Apple is switching all of their computers to ARM processors. This doesn't seem like a big deal at first because Apple does not sell many computers compared to PC's. However, Microsoft has been trying to create a Windows on ARM platform for years and if Apples ARM chips live up to the hype (which they currently are) Microsoft could be forced to take their own ARM platform more seriously. 

As far as I can tell the only use where x86 processors have any staying power is in gaming PC's, but AMD is killing that market at the moment and I don't see Intel beating them in price to performance anytime soon. 

I could be wrong though. Most of my info comes from tech blogs and YouTube.

Tracking simple death rate would be inaccurate. Tracking excess mortality nets the heart attack dude out of the number we are talking about in THIS article. CDC is not the only game in town. MANY academic, non political, non MM, with no a to grind but facts, have calculated this pandemic using excess mortality (p-score or even z-score...look it up kids) precisely because it ensures we are not counting heart attacks as covid deaths.

Then that sustainably gives your lump of matter the happy chemicals, and experiencing the happy chemicals is all we're here to do. The happy chemicals and the idea of getting the happy chemicals are what drive everything around us and if you arent getting the happy chemicals then try something else. The people in your life want you to have the happy chemicals.

Bonus points for helping other people get the happy chemicals because then the total amount of happy chemical being experienced is higher.

The last few minutes of Tesla options trading are always volatile.. Buyers will lowball or sweep their bids off completely and sellers will post crazy ask prices. So when you look AH the pricing is usually distorted. That‚Äôs why if you look the next trading day you will see that this call apparently went up 17000% while the ones just above and below it will have gone  down 8% or whatever.
no. wait till 2021 after december 31st q4 earning report. that will be the time they dump and you can get in low.

I've only played Tesla once. Went balls-in on puts at the end of August. It went... very well. I only had to hold for like 3 days to take massive profits.

Was the first and last time I'll play Tesla, though.

With every stock, bulls lose money and bears lose money. It's all about timing. Acting like no Tesla bears have profited is silly af, given how volatile it is. I can also guarantee that thousandss of WSBers went bankrupt buying tesla calls at the wrong time, as well.
Mercedes does the same.
Tsla... the winner.

Is there any way to know whether Tesla selling off their $5b was at least part of it? That‚Äôs what I assumed.
At that moment in time, was watching the closing price and it was only around $658, so when my sell order went through I DID think I got lucky matching with someone who put in a buy limit order right before close (since the closing price wasn't at $695 til moments later).  Of course, I've since learned about 70M shares traded at that price and feel a lot less special...
same. still get up at 5am to feed the dog and shower no matter what day it is. its ingrained.

Good question. Say $660 and then it does normal index stuff.

As much as I like TSLA the stock, I have to warn people there isn't much chance of replicating this. To get another 10x out of TSLA would require the market cap to go to 6 trillion. That would be 3x the market cap of Apple which is the most profitable mega-cap company in the history of the world.

It could happen but holy shit the bubble that would be needed to get us there is truly frightening.

why would we steal from the corps? they didn't make the rules, would make more sense to take money out of politician's salaries. they're already making tons of money doing their usual shady shit, what do they need a salary for.

Well done. Tried to buy some CRWD calls at open but too expensive for my account...had I found FEYE then I would have at least bought a couple. Found it later in the day and got one $19 12/31 call with 220% return.

As bad as life ever gets the alternative sucks more. So work hard and you can at least make it a little better, if not a whole lot. I went from making \~12 bucks an hour to six figures in the span of three years but I challenged myself nonstop. Am I saying you gotta do what I did? No what I did sucked.

I‚Äôm staying away from reits....too much debt... i think energy will be interesting.

If crude doesnt start to get that speculative fever though i will just put what i had in energy into jnj. I‚Äôm pretty confident that stock is going higher.
SPCE very obviously is a vaporware memestock,  without a viable business plan or sustainable market, it's basically just advertising.

>At the end of the day nobody knows retard.

The one reasonable thing you've said.

It is, however, a little bit retarded of a point to make when you come in here attacking my theory, acting like there's no way volatility can go up next week, and downvoting anyone who disagrees with you.
But what if future me is just better at concocting a mental fiction that deceives himself into believing he‚Äôs found meaning and fulfillment?

Imma keep playing it out, but man it feels pointless as fuck
Oh, then dm me the link please. I am interested in that.
i really dont find that to be all that crazy. if you pick a stock and buy and sell the rises and dips, you could easily make 92 trades in a day if you took small gains every few minutes. thats only like 15-16 trades an hour, which is about a trade every 5 minutes. person probably makes a few bucks on a stock then cashes out and does it again and again all day long for 6 and a half hours.
People outside the industry of concern, and the incident response of those affected, still don‚Äôt see the full impact.

This is not going to turn into a happy ending in a week or two.

As u/insanegreek2020 stated there  will  be  a  flurry  of  lawsuits,  not  because  people  fell  victim,  but  because  they  were  not  informed.  Industry  practice  is  to  inform,  correct,  and  continue,  however  they  failed  to  inform  until  an  outside  party  forced  their  hand.

SolarWinds as a brand is done, the products will continue, but they will not be under the same negligent guidance.

When you put in your sell limit order at $694.20 and no one had a buy limit order at that price, then the outstanding $695 buy limit orders would be paired with yours.  As you can see in the pic, I originally had a $700 sell limit set and that wouldn't have sold.

Uh, this is the play before. If I said this *after* volatility popped next week, then you'd have a point.

Oh yeah if its 5% and in shares it is perfect. But like you were saying starting with mostly ETFs and a small part of his portfolio in meme stocks is great. This is the advices I give out to my family as well, like I would never tell them to buy MARA even if it has been my personal favorite those last few weeks.
I can't give any financial advice.  When I made a big bet on TSLA, I didn't tell my family because I knew it was risky and didn't want them to replicate it.  It just worked out and much better than I anticipated.  Don't have a specific price target on a dip, I watch TSLA stock religiously so if I think it's trending flat or back up, I'll buy back in.
The reason why it hasn‚Äôt happened already is low end income people in the US have historically had better lives than low end income people anywhere else in the world. But that‚Äôs been getting squeezed over the last 20 years with no minimum wage increases to match inflation, w2 full time jobs replaced by gig/1099 jobs, healthcare & education costs inflating multiple times faster than anything else. You can only squeeze people so much.
Volatility is tough. You gotta have a really good reason to go long, and you have to be willing to see a lot of red before you're right.

I am personally long VIX and long VXX.

Y‚Äôall ever wake up feeling like you‚Äôre down 40 points in a meaningless high school football game with 30 seconds left in the 4th quarter and you‚Äôd rather just spike the ball and let the clock run out instead of get up and run another play? 

You can‚Äôt though because other team mates are depending on you, your dad lives his football dreams vicariously through you, and you know you‚Äôd disappoint everyone if you didn‚Äôt keep going. 

That‚Äôs basically how I feel about life, like why do i gotta do all this shit when I‚Äôm not even having fun and it doesn‚Äôt mean anything anyways.

I do once a week so maybe later today
They will have to hold, but if they do thats super bullish.. Value stocks rallying with tech and consumer discretionary all at the same time is pretty much nirvana for the market...If rates continue to rise significantly on Monday, cyclicals/value will do well. If rates kinda pause, I‚Äôd be more inclined to go into health care or packaged goods... jnj is both and should do well regardless of what rates do.
Watch out for time puns coming in 3, 2,
Much appreciate the explanation ‚Äî didn‚Äôt know you could sell calls against options vs shares.
I would agree except government fucked over small businesses while favoring big corporations during these covid lockdowns. The market has already been interfered with so why not keep digging

Valuations don't even mean anything anymore. Did you watch that video on wsb just posted of Cramer telling us how he and other institutions with big money can control the market? Saying that valuations are nothing anymore and it's all about tricking us retail investors into selling our shares.

I like your diversification plan. Can't go tits up üöÄ
2020: Man has heart attack, goes to hospital and dies. He is tested for covid and is found positive. Covid is added to death certificate because it may have contributed to his death. Death is added to the total of covid-related deaths. Very smart people here and in the media will now mistakenly count him as someone who has died from covid.

2019: Man has heart attack, goes to hospital and dies. He is not tested for flu. Even though he had the flu, it will not be added to his death certificate and will not be counted as a flu-related death.
I wonder if its run up is over if theres some more meme energy in it for next week
just drill a glory hole at that point
Wouldn‚Äôt this only be like 100-200k? Unless he traded options and didn‚Äôt just buy shares

Shut up bitch.
Stop begging dude
Let‚Äôs say you bought the $10 call on PLTR expiring in January 2022, it would cost you about $1500. Monday you can sell the $30C expiring Friday for around $30. Let‚Äôs assume PLTR doesn‚Äôt exceed $30/share, you would then keep your long $10 call and the $30 premium you sold. If it does exceed the $30/share, your option would be called a way at a profit and you would also keep the $30 premium. Ideally, you pick a strike on the weekly call that you do not think the stock will hit. The goal is to steal the premium and keep your long option. You can do this every week until the January 2022 expiry of your $10 call. If you pick the right strikes weekly and never have your long option called away, over the term of the long call, you can likely recoup your initial investment through the weekly calls and have a zero cost position on an option that will have gained significant value over the year.

This is called a ‚Äúpoor mans covered call‚Äù if you‚Äôre still confused and need to do more research.

That's the daily gain from start of day. If you made some trades in the middle of the day, they assume it was bought before start of day. When market closes, the daily gain value changes instantly to reflect that. Your total gain is the real indicator of your investments. 

At 12 midnight, your daily gains become 0, since it reflects the gains you made since 12 midnight.

Just FYI, the moment you realize a loss/profit, that trade value vanishes from daily and total gains.

You got 3 years. Sell the volatility and i think you should be fine because I really don't see 41$ idk maybe I'm sounding like a üåàüêª
Inside a bathroom you want decent caulk anywhere else whatever is fine. The most important part is to clean and dry the area before sealing. Keep a rag and bucket of water with you when sealing so you can clean up the excess/wash your hands before it cures. A small piece of rounded rubber or plastic is great for shaping the seal nicely. Finger works fine too.

Your right about them mixing it. You would never know about it until you try and cook it. 

I hung around with a guy who would cut it with something called marshmellow. People would come in and buy a gram with 50% cut and take a line and think it was good.

Ive never traded options. Are expiry days every day or only fridays?
Everyone is expecting it to tank. So maybe you are the smart one by inversing the majority. We'll see.
First of all buying an option on Monday is going to be more expensive than if you bought on Friday. What happened was the call was going to expire worthless if the price did not move. It gradually increased in price throughout the day with little volume in the morning. The 17c was exactly the right point because it was to expire worthless, but also ITM enough by the time market closed because the price was 19.23. So if you bought a 17c at market open and it didn‚Äôt move, it‚Äôd be worth .01. Since the price moved to 19.23 gradually, it became ITM. The only way to really capture such a move is if you notice the buy volume on the stock start to increase. The only way you can even really get that kind of return is on a 0DTE option. You would not have gotten the same kind of return if you got the option on Monday, it would have been more of a U shape. So really the only way to detect it is half luck, half noticing volume on the ticker. Seeing it after the fact makes it easy to say ‚Äúoh if I had just bought this, I‚Äôd have this,‚Äù but the reality is it‚Äôs all chance and luck.
I think it went over your head. They had a metals trading desk that was caught spoofing and JPMC had to pay like 900MM dollars.

He brought me with him just like you said. I‚Äôm with him always.
Yup, tbh being in shape and looking fairly well put together is just such an easy thing you can do to make your day to day interactions significantly easier. Even if it doesn't matter to you a significant minority of people will treat you much better if you look good. It's like being on time and organised, even if you're a lazy schlub those two things are low hanging fruit to impress retards who care about them.

The government will not back SolarWinds on this. Internal discussions are based around orders to disconnect and data calls on impact of discontinuation of utilization of the software suites.

&#x200B;

The scenario may turn to a wild fire and a sell off of intellectual property to cover losses of those they have a fiduciary duty to.

&#x200B;

You are correct that the products they produce are ingrained in day to day operations of nearly all players in the industry, BUT sell off is the biggest name in the game in this sector. When a company can not function any longer their dying cry is the jettison of their intellectual property and client bases to a competitor. Their products WILL NOT die but their brand very well may, in which case Orion and others will be known by a different vendor.

Monday was first blood. Friday saw a 19.8% drop. Internal investigations are worse than public knowledge at this point. This is the greatest exploit in history and it was known about before the disclosure.

&#x200B;

To think that the price can‚Äôt fall to its March low at the least is foolish. In March they dropped into to 12s and that was based on following the market down. SolarWinds is on its way to the floor nearly by itself now, and it will be fueled by negligence and information that the board failed to disclose.

This is not the end.

Palantir could legit go to $1000 and the value would be justified. To be fair, a $100 valuation by the end of 2021 is pretty on par for what the stock should be at, given its performance.

never too late to hustle
I see. So this is a way to make a decently large return but it‚Äôs limited instead. 

Unrelated question, but you don‚Äôt have to wait for calls to be in the money to make profit on that call. Like as long as it‚Äôs moving in that direction and there‚Äôs not too much theta decay, you could just sell the calls before expiration and take a quick gain instead, right?
What about FEYE?

Expect gains somewhere between what you've experienced with TSLA and SPY's average annual gains.  So somewhere between 7 - 700% annual gains.

At this point, I'm concerned TSLA can drag index down...
It's market cap weighted. So think of it as if the price was 100.

Since Tesla had a higher market cap than the company removed, other holdings have to go down. So if SPY was 5% Apple before, now it might be 4%. IBM might move from 1% to .5%, etc.

Off and on for 4 years now. Only when I drink though, not every day, sometimes I go a month or two without doing it but when I do it I do it to the max, spend lots of money on it, sometimes getting it 3 or 4 times from the dealer in a night, do it all through the night to the morning, and takes me days to recover, erasing all progress I have made mentally and physically and often times taking time off work.

So if I buy the 30c and sell the 45c, when would one exercise the 45c?
When its ITM. If the 45c is in the money, then the 30c I bought is also in the money. So they exercise the 45c, my 30c is also exercised.

So someone buys 4500 of stock from me. I am forced to buy 3000 worth of stock from someone else to sell it for 4500.

4500 -3000, I make 1500 minus whatever the debit is


I want people to exercise basically. That's my max profit range

XPEV is vertically integrated with their own built from scratch manufacturing function and full technology stack inhouse. They are ahead of NIO in terms of being a fully fleshed company, and their tech advantage will be significant going forward. As well, their P7 car just won a highly prestigious car of the year award which should ser up great momentum into 2021. At half the market cap of NIO and with a higher growth rate, I think XPEV is convincingly the better play on the balance.

You're kind of proving my point lol. You're comparing (I'm assuming) the original model 3 to a high end Mercedes S class. The model 3 has decreased in price by about 20-30% since 2017. You can currently get a new 2020 model in the $35-$45k range which is pretty average price wise for the auto industry.

It is concerning if you think the stock is overvalued and investors are going to take profits the first chance they get. I know this year cannot really be used for historical data because it has been so off-base, but PTON was getting the exact same treatment in 1Q 2020 over their first lock-up expiration. The stock did fall from around 27 to 19 after expiration but that was in conjunction with you know one of the largest fucking drops in history. Only two weeks after lockup expiration did PTON begin a trajectory that left a bunch of douches crying about rigged markets as their puts and shorts evaporated into nothing. Once again, it's a special case because home-workout equipment plus quarantine equals growth, but at the same time we are looking at a company that is supposed to be heavily involved in this years fuckery. I'd say weekly puts might actually capture premium, but we are also looking at the January effect where investors gonna drop their bonuses into the most recently talked about low-price stocks without having any idea what a lockup exp is. I've got late 1Q OTM calls right now, going to watch for a good put entry next week and a good leap call entry as well.
Lol I just started trading and my story is almost the same.

After lurking this sub for a year and a half, I decided in August 2020 to join RH. I deposited 7k (why I don't waste people's time by posting), bought SPY, TSLA, NIO calls, and NIO shares. Then September happened bad I was down 50%. The losing streak was crushing me I wanted to close everything, put my money in vanguard, and just quit.

But then I decided to yolo everything into NIO and CRSR in October, and boy did things turn around. I rolled profits from the calls I bought in October to more calls for both. I was up to 11k before the corrections and shorts. I was down to 8k but now through aggressive theta and averaging down calls I'm üíéüëê on, I'm back to 10.7k as of Friday! One day I'll do something worthy of posting, for now I'm just happy to ride the short bus with you guys.

Because of the lag delay and After-Hours Effect would the Christmas earnings have larger swings like on Thanksgiving?
Why do you think that
Mainly ief and shy which are short term and 7-10 year us treasury bonds....tips got inflows but nothing worth noting. Actually high yield corporate and investment grade corporate saw bigger outflows than sovereigns...hyg had over 2.5 billion in outflows last week while Lqd had 2 billion. Thats pretty significant... if that accelerates i dont think itll be good for the entire market. Any big move down in corporate bonds will cause a sell off in stocks as well... so its probably prudent to pair your long stock positions with a short junk bonds position. Maybe even gold? Monday will really tell us a lot. But i think money will keep going into stocks but you have to pick the right ones(low debt, and earnings momentum.

Anyone have a good feeling for Tesla Monday? I feel like calls are gonna be up BIGLY!
TSLA's PE is insane, if you paid for a share of TSLA, at the current TTM earnings of $0.52/share, it would take 1,329 years to break even.  

That's assuming no more retards jumping on the bandwagon to drive share price up, ofc.
That would be a cash secured put, not even slightly naked

Buy Tesla puts at Monday open
Trading 212? Pretty shitty and limited but you can trade options
There's a non zero chance that's what's been happening the last three days. The last big short price down was at the 15.80 mark. When it's higher than that some late to the party shorts are losing money. 

The counter point to your argument is that many of these shorts shorted huge percentages of the overall float. So it'll take days to get out of them and would cause a mini squeeze in itself.

It may stay up. I am hoping for a swift correction. I had some TSLA calls that made me 30k but if I held to expiry would have been worth 280k.  Since then I got angry and bitter and have blown almost 40k on TSLA puts.  Seriously.  My DD comes from a place of stupidity.

I have an friend who showed me his portfolio in 2017, it was $3m almost all TSLA. Dude was 27 at the time. I told him at that time that TSLA was overhyped and overvalued.

If he‚Äôs got two million worth of shares I can easily see that being a million by the end of the year

You probably could have gone way sooner than 2023, bought more calls, and went ITM faster.

It‚Äôs faster to go from 25k to 1k sir

The answer is probably not. Funds can buy from the moment it gets announced. And a lot of them do. Though because of its large size there is probably still shares they need to buy.

Thursday. 25k. Yesterday 8k more.  12/24 550 and 580.  Is that deep? You?
I think if you play just one you are crazy (not a good crazy). Play them all. MT, S c h n i z t e r, CLF, VALE, BHP. Also, sprinkle some CAT and maybe TEX in with them. I like CAT more. Can't go tits up.

Depression is an issue 100 percent.

I was implying that confidence is confidence whether it is a delusion (i.e. simulation) or well deserved. Like a professional athlete, their delusionally high confidence helped them get to the .01 percent because they believed they could do it or blame ridiculous shit for their losses even though it was their fault they lost a fight or a game. 

I didn't see the connection to depression but I think you are saying being confident is to not be depressed. 

In which case I will say move forward confidently, no matter if you have to simulate that confidence. There are many sources of positivity that can address feeling shitty, finding it requires action and it for sure doesn't matter where the confidence to take action comes from. 

 You got this brotha.

All depends if they can extract themselves from fab hell before they lose all their market share.

They will lose their only major advantage over AMD if they are forced to go with TSMC.

Personally think it is too early to buy puts on them - if they do die it will be a slow and painful death, i.e. don't think you will see much profit from puts. Long dated calls a few year out might be better.

I am just getting into this myself, so this question is to a more experienced trader, but couldn't you place an open buy order at the strike price of your call option, so that if it DOES go to that price, you'll just buy it at the strike price, and also collect the premium?

I thought of this the other night in a dream.  I am only into stocks right now, but am dreaming of those tendies...
The GME negativity sentiments are even higher in other investing subs.
It has to be terrifying being a woman and walking around knowing a large majority of the population can physically dominate you. As smaller guy that shit scares me sometimes
Well you can certainly buy one, just maybe not one of the new models for which they create artificial scarcity to drive up the price.

Tbh I don't see the company just vanishing in a few years. But in 10 years? I doubt it will exist anymore. Doesn't have the B&M to compete with Walmart or Target, doesn't have the online presence to compete with those two plus Amazon. Even though the stock has been going up over the years, BBY itself has been dying. In 2016 they 2500 stores. Now they have 1000 and those closing were before covid. Once life goes back to normal, so will BBY, and the bleed will begin again.

As an afterthought, once it crashes and people remember comments like mine, the word that BBY doesn't turn good profits will spread

Regular run day today, squatted yesterday so this will be miserable!
You get assigned so it will look like you have a huge negative balance, but they will sell it Monday at open and you get the difference if TSLA stays above your strike price.  If TSLA opens below your strike, then you're screwed.  So I guess my $680c theory would be in trouble right now

Here's a thought. Call around to a lot of the independent veterinarians so nothing like a banfield hospital. And explain your situation explain you have a sick cat this is what you can afford this is how much you get every month and would they help you. And I'm pretty sure an independent veterinarian within a reasonably close area will help you and will work with you. Because that's why they got into veterinarian to begin with

I'm a bit autist so I only read every 20th word
I was raised in a very insular, backwoods, religious family. My parents had this huge stockpile of canned food hoarded behind our sectional couch. They bought so much gasoline AND a generator.

 I was in 6th grade and thought that the world as I knew it was coming to an end. I thought everyone else was spooked like my family was. It‚Äôs one of those weird details of many weird details from my past.

I‚Äôm grown up now (and wildly different from my parents), and I just had this conversation with my partner. I asked her how her family reacted and what they were doing for Y2K. She was like, ‚ÄúWe were on vacation having the time of our lives celebrating the holidays in Spain. We thought people like your parents were nuts.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm 33 and I‚Äôm continually learning about what an insane upbringing I had.

I just realized that we might have some retarded gain porn if some of you guys bought 0dte OTM TSLA calls few minutes before closing.  Like the $680c could have been around dollar which would've closed $15 in the money.  My guess is even the $660c would've been around $1 2 minutes before closing that would've been a $1 to $3500 play.

I had this happen where somebody excercized SPY calls I sold OTM by 50c at close. While it did trend to ITM AH, and exceeded the strike for about a second, by the time the assignment hit I was indeed up $200 from being short 100 SPY shares as a result of the assignment, and just sold for a larger profit than the option itself yeilded. Was def just an algo that bought AH based on the probabilty of post market moves, but then the trend reversed.
Same. I saw how it consistantly went from $26-$28, cashed in on minor gains and got back in on the dip

Boi, Robinhood should launch in India
A Tesla 540 put expiring 12/18/20 (same day), bought at 3:02PM for $0.05 and sold at 3:06 PM at $2.44 would have generated a 4780% profit. The trading volume of this option is 10,626.
So much GME hate that day on this sub.  People on this sub love when others fail.  Some little bitches out there.
Curious to see how tsla IV reacts to spy.  Assume it marches it self down to 50ish.  Not a bad entry point for leaps.

You know BBY is gonna tank EOY right?

I have a theory that Robinhood actually saved BBY stock. Look at it's five year chart and see how it's grown since RH became a broker

The key to my theory is this:

Every year fresh teenage investors join RH with little to no market knowledge or money. They are not smart anyway so they look up companies they think are invincible. "AMZN is $3k and BBY $100, I'll buy BBY!"

And then that batch sees that Black Friday and Christmas don't generate a lot of profit, it's actually barely makes profit at all. In fact it's like those sleazy destitute used car salesmen who pull all kinds of shit to give the appearance of having money when it's all cash flow.

So what do they do? The sell it to the next batch of retard 18 year olds, which is why it crashes cyclically.


TLDR: Robinhood and teenagers are the reason people like BBY and OP is fucked

I think Tesla‚Äôs gonna make a big big push into home and commercial energy storage and creation, and maybe even home HVAC. IMO, that‚Äôs where a lot of their market share will come from in the future. 

It‚Äôs a big market, and Tesla‚Äôs already doing super well with their commercial PowerPacks and residential PowerWalls. I imagine PowerWalls will probably become standard in homes eventually, same with solar. Would be a nice future.
You have to make some kind of ridiculous bet or it doesn't count

He heads to the bathroom. And unprovoked and out of nowhere his girlfriend goes ‚ÄúI was perfectly fine being single. I was single for 2 years, but he was so persistent.‚Äù 

I look over my shoulders because I wasn‚Äôt sure if/why she was telling me this.

Whats being missed is that the close number that S and P bought of 695 could have been the price market set for the dark pool orders to fulfill the remaining volume needed Monday which is more likely.

I doubt you'll have any buy orders of that volume Monday if any.

Your best case scenario is EOD Monday if they need to buy again and they have already picked up the majority of the stocks they need. That flash crash were hedge funds dumping for profit when they didn't see the run up they wanted IE everyone that thats retail that wants Tesla was already in. Means you have no buying support Monday open and a flash crash is very likely.

Are we looking at the same graph? Look at price history of all time. It's just shy of the peak. Plus, unless tradingview is using fake math, RSI is 61, which is close to overbought. Unless I'm reading this whole thing wrong, it looks like it matches the "anatomy of a bubble" chart

Congrats on the promotion. At worst, you're just testing the waters so you know how much you're worth on the open market. Before I took a promotion last year I actually told my boss and my boss's boss that I was shopping around first. Kinda depends on the environment though I wouldn't recommend a move like that normally

Still has $58 to go to reach ATH. Far from its ATH dude, we‚Äôd need $60B more in market cap on the buy side for that. In terms of RSI and 3 month chart is really undervalued

Why the hell not? I feel like Pfizer did 20 percent in about a month so why not jnj? It just seems like everyone is sleeping on it....if wsb just starts buying  cheap calls instead of palantir or whatever ridiculous 100 iv stock then why cant it look at cheap options as an even bigger opportunity?
Thats why u dont sell options 3 months before expiry. You giving away all your extrinsic value for nothing.

The company‚Äôs valuation is barely 30% of annual turnover. Bankruptcy was priced in but the company can stay afloat with a healthy cash reserve and new console cycle tailwind. 

Potential correction due to the excessive shorting of the name is what really draws the speculation, not so much the turnaround story in itself imo
At least you manage risk dude.

Think ps5 is selling way more copies with discs than pure digital, because people want to buy physical copies, perhaps because you can resell them after/buy used copies.

GME are also pivoting to digital, selling more that way, and try to offer same day games etc. This has been written up better by others, search the subreddit for GME DD threads, and skim past the SS sections in there

Nobody is telling you to lie, just be selective about what you do and don't say. Never say anything bad about former workplaces, don't say UM like a hundred times, and rehearse but don't read directly from your notes. Keep track of anything you do that elicits positive feedback.

Also, with a resume, it should be a list of accomplishments, not responsibilities. Nobody needs your old job description, they want to see quantifiable ways that you kicked fucking ass.

It hit $16 right before earnings then sold off heavy to $12. It took it all of what 2 weeks to get back to $16? There is so much strength and momentum here it would be risky to jump out now. Q3 was the bottom of their off cycle. From this point forward they will see a boost from console revenue and next gen gaming software.

Can't really go into a Rolex store (authorized dealer) to buy a Rolex. As counterintuitive as it sounds, ad's have very limited supply (especially of popular models like submariners and Daytonas) and the only way to get a popular model is to buy a less popular model first to become an existing customer.

So they may not have been judging your ability to afford a Rolex based on your appearance. It's just that your lack of an existing business relationship with them means they don't have a watch available to sell to you.
That's what I'm doing.
I remember looking like 40 min before close and thinking how incredible it was that a 700c - which was like 50+ otm was still trading period.

Yeah the practice is worth it. If you want to send me your resume I'll help suss it out, just remove all the personal info. 

At first you'll fail a lot because your resume won't be tuned right. Then you'll fail a lot on the phone screen. Then you'll fail a lot during interviews. The important thing is to pay very close attention to where you're failing, take meticulous notes, and never get discouraged even though it will ruin your very soul. Then one day you will run out of stuff to fail on and the job is yours. Two years later, rinse and repeat.

Crsr ready to pop
I listened to an interview on another post of a GME bull who knew the company inside and out. He dropped some really interesting info but one thing that stuck with me, and just popped back in my head reading your post about the GME bears. There have been a ton of institutions come in lately especially during Q3, grabbing millions of shares to go long. In the interview he pointed out of the larger shorts I think it was Melvin capital, that had put options expiring in July, they rolled those puts up to January. He then proceeded to mention they may be trying to make their exit from their short position and cover early, shifting the short squeeze burden to retail shorts. 

This could end badly for retail if that whole ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù mindset is still this prevalent. I‚Äôm long gme but it‚Äôs way too risky to short this name with the kind of momentum it has both fundamentally and technically.

You forgot that one month later 1.8 BILLION stocks hit the market when the lock up period is over.

If they (employees and early investors) were happy to sell at 13 they‚Äôll be fucking over the moon to sell at 30.

I‚Äôll repeat it. 1.8 BILLION stocks that they were happy to sell at 9 and/or 13 dollars. Remember, they could only sell 20% of their stocks then. Now they can unload the remaining 80%. 

I sound like a üåàüêª buuuut I‚Äôm actually bullish.

Palantir looks like a great long term play, but I ain‚Äôt touching it before those shares hit the market unless it‚Äôs for trading, which by the way is awesome thanks to its volatility.

I just don't understand.

Why bet against TSLA?

It rarely works.
puts (or calls) dont affect the market a single bit. 

just for anyone who may not know but may find this interesting (this is my own research/understanding, take it for what its worth)

1. shorts can aggressively tear down the bids (red candles) which is literally **market** "sell to open"  
2. longs can aggressively push up the ask (green candles) which is **market** "buy to open"

3. conservative shorts will set a **limit at the ask** or higher (getting a better entry) but they won't affect the market but will instead add liquidity to the books  
4. conservative longs will set a **limit at the bid** or lower (getting a better entr) but again, they will simply be adding liquidity

what cramer was saying was using aggressive strategies on the short and long side to manipulate longs, and they usually attack because they do order book analysis that is algo driven which determines liquidity on either side of the bid or ask

this is the reason why market order is called market order because it literally affects the market, whether you short or long

I'll repost my comment from higher up:

Note that GameStop does not have to beat Amazon at all (like many here think) to blast off to the moon. The company is insanely undervalued in terms of market cap, it just has to stay afloat (which is almost guaranteed given their financials and huge boost from the concole cycle) and find it's own niche in this huge gaming market.

People mistakenly assume two things:

1) **Everyone is buying digital:** not really true. Tons of people have crappy internet, consoles have very limited storage. And sometimes folks like to own something physical (myself included) - I still buy paper books despite having 4 devices to read from (Kindle is one of them).

Also, this point is even less relevant considering the fact of digital sales revenue sharing with Microsoft and rumors of similar agreements with Sony.

2). **GameStop only sells games on CDs / Will always sell CDs.** Haven't been true for a while, and lots of new directions they can take it to; gaming equipment, at the very least. Think Chewy for gaming (this is where our boy Ryan Cohen comes in)

On top of that sprinkle some insanely huge short interest (128%) playing as an insane upwards pushing force and you get a risky bet but with an insane reward potential.

Also, just a sidenote: a company with absolutely no revenue that makes EV renders and rolls trucks downhill has 6.6x market cap of GME, let that sink in.
Specially given the fact that cyber punk is trending because it got recalled.
Any chance you can write a program to tell us where these are before they happen? Asking for a friend (just kidding, I have no friends).

Also consider that the shares float is less then five years ago thanks to buybacks. To reach a new all time high in terms of share price (>$62) the company needs to be valued half it's own ATH market cap. Can the company be at least half as good as it once was? Just 1/4th is fucking splendid for me, it puts us at a nice $31

I tossed some money at a FEYE call when hack news came out because I speculated they might get their shit together at some point. Problem is I had little faith so it was a Jan 2022 call

That call is now up 200% but now I actually have to do some DD and figure out an exit strategy as the bump I was waiting for happened almost immediately rather than at a more obvious sell point in a year or so

Anybody that monitors this space more closely have any ideas? I saw the guy post saying "double up in next 3 months" but I have my doubts just looking at their 5Y

Okay. Say in a (hypothetical) situation where one of my legs keeps staying at 0.01 on expiration (i.e. if TSLA is going to the moon in Jan and it's just very expensive to buy a call at the leg's strike, thus no bids), I'll still pocket the max profit from the spread, right? Still learning here ü§£

How exactly could 250 pound set you up for life
no what happened to tesla is big funds bought shitloads of stocks. They had to buy approx. 120 mio shares. average volume for TSLA in these recent days was about 50 mio/day. So if you add 50+120 = 170 mio, it ended at I think around 190mio and then the rest after hours. So funds are all done, gobbled it up and pray to god it crashes and burns Monday Tuesday. :)

Since this sub is blowing up and talked about every day on cnbc i thought itd be good to post the holdings of the etf with the largest inflow on friday... vtv‚Äîvanguard value fund. Over 1 billion in inflows were recorded friday....This means this fund will have to buy more of the stocks in the index to maintain value of the fund. VIG and dia also saw big inflows and Jnj is by far the biggest winner of these inflows. It is the second largest weighting in vtv and the 6th largest in vig. Walmart is another major holding in both but Jnj has more catalysts ahead and is probably the best pick. Options for out of the money Jnj calls are actually pretty cheap since the stock has not done anything in 3 years basically...that could be about to change .

I'm not saying EMH is right esp the part of fair market value. I am saying everything is priced in the market, especially sentiment. Look at a sub that's grown astronomically as wsb celebrating the everyman TSLA millionaire who plowed everything into TSLA without a shred of DD. COVID and the recent public interest in global ecological collapse and the climate crisis has been and will continue to be awesome for Tesla until the bubble pops (since those will be continually worse issues) and that won't be likely until another more significant black swan event that disables a lot of modern infrastructure.

The infinity squeeze is unlikely, but you have to admit that all these shorts have to cover at some point, even slow and steady squeeze (like TSLA at some point) is still nice

Return business and also not so much that they don't care but more so they know who and when they have to impress. Plus sometimes its the small things like a nice watch that makes you, the wearer, feel nice.

If you wear a suit 9-5 M-F, you probably don't want to wear one on your days off shopping unless you have to.

Why is it when I look back using ThinkorSwim OnDemand, the options prices don't match. For example, the SPCE 40c is $0.03 at 9:43am, then I move the time to 12:57pm and it's still $0.03. Am I missing something here?

This has become a common issue tbh. I had bad insomnia last year and did a sleep study thing at Northwestern. The key is retraining your brain to associate your bed with rest, and not frustration at not being able to sleep. If you can‚Äôt fall asleep for 20 min, get up and leave your bed. Take melatonin, use lavender essential oil and maybe a nasal strip. Meditate before bed. There are a few natural things you can do to start getting yourself back into a groove

5meoDMT was a gamechanger for me . One hit and I felt like a different person from there on out . Had been dealing with the sudden loss of my parents and just felt empty inside and it felt like it gave me a new chance at life. If you're unfamiliar look into it you'll see almost everyone saying the same thing as me. Way more effective than any other therapy or drug I've ever done

What I would do for a life like this
This is the exactly excuse I have for owning a VW Jetta...
Other workarounds that keep facebooks ad business booming - like what? You're an outsider looking in. You don't know what you're talking about. 

The closest thing to a workaround is server to server side tracking because when the customer is on your website = its technically your data.  But the point is, when you send that opted out customer's data to facebook, facebook can't use those data points or they get booted off the app store. I know this because while you're balls deep in calls, im balls deeper in advertising on fb/ig, plus I'm in a few solid, PAID advertising groups where good advertisers/smma people congregate. 

You think voluntary data "give fb my info" opt in rates are gonna be as good as 4 out of 10? Lol ok. 



OH, now you're starting from scratch as an advertiser. Without being able to collect topline metrics from those opted out - such as impressions, clicks, click through rates, cpms, page views, view contents, add to carts, initiate checkouts, etc.... the only data events you'll get is the "purchase data" event on your store. 



Oh great, you get 1 data point from this opted out person, rather than the normal 10 data points. You know how big of a difference that is? 


On top of that, this 1 purchase data point can be used for like what, 7 days now? That's a huge decrease of epic proportions. 


Guess what that means for you, noob advertiser? SHITTIER TRAFFIC. Less conversions. Less machine learning. You're running the race but missing 7 toes. 


Of course, the more bigger and entrenched advertisers and other smart ones will start focusing on reach now, not conversions anymore because conversions are harder to come by with this huge handicap. 



Look, a good workaround is collecting and controlling as many of your customer's emails and info as possible. That's a given. But even then, you won't be able to use a lot of them now that they're opted out. You can email them, nice. But you won't be using them on facebook, because if they opted out then if facebook uses that data in their algorithm, thats against apples new rules! 

The second workaround is focusing more on organic content, like your ig. Of course, you'll still lose a lot of machine learning power when you run paid ads (where fb actually makes money from you) because i'll bet a good percentage of those people have ios. You can hit the people followin you with organic content - but you can't use their data to find similar people who will buy now. You can get organic sales, but paid facebook ppc sales & data from those will be more scarce.  




**Bottom line is you're a trader. Don't assume shit you don't know. I'm not a big advertising fish, but by now I've spent nearly 1 million usd on facebook and ig ads. So I have some idea of what im saying.**


Either way, maybe your shit will print short term  - because it takes time for traders like you to figure this out. That's cool. If it dips, maybe ill buy leaps too. But i am NOT banking on their ad business as much anymore. I'd be banking on their VR ecosystem, because id assume that they would have control of that.
I would not want to be trading tesla right now...way easier plays than that ....value stocks will take the mantel again i believe . There was a massive inflow in to the vanguard value fund friday and with rates heading higher on the ten year and the thirty year, getting into overvalued growth stocks now is way too risky....especially call options that have massive vol priced in already...take a look at stocks with lower vol but improving momentum....xom , cvx, jnj, csco, some of the semi conductor stocks....

Distressing situation happening at TSLA.

Hedge funds have cornered the market. They have been slowly buying up 12/18 ITM call options with the intent to exercise and further drive demand for TSLA shares with the inclusion to S&P.

Expect a big pop above $695 in the early morning on Monday as frantic institutions look to buy shares to cover the assignment.

Looks like the end game is massive inflation. The dollar is trash. No one believes that the ten year yield is legit so you either go into cash which gets you nothing or you buy stonks with solid earnings and good dividends...commodities should also outperform as people start speculating there when they take profits in their stonks or bonds...
Do you expect me to chuck USB sticks at strippers
It's the opposite of Tesla in many ways. Speaking for me, I would never buy it because I prefer popular product brands and I have no idea what they do. I also have no idea how to value it. PLTR has 700M in revenue, when tesla was at that valuation they had 22B in revenue in 2018... I mean wtf. How. The story may be good but there's nothing else to grasp on.

One red flag is WSB being so obsessedly bullish. In 2019 most people here were bearish on Tsla

Sure PLTR may rise again due to hype but then what?
Any idea how many shares? I saw 1.7 billion shares?

Nurse practitioners require at least 6 years of schooling not including clinicals. They also don't call themselves doctors, they are APNs. They have a similar level of autonomy as physician assistants and, therefore, wouldn't be blamed for a death because that level of care is decided by an M.D.

Firstly tell your family and close friends. You need a support network and you'll feel better immediately. Secondly, go and see a doctor and seek professional help about the drinking & mental health issues. The doctor will help you and you'll be starting to take control of the situation. Thirdly, Start exercising. Running, cycling, swimming will do wonders for your mental health and you'll be getting a regular endorphin rush.You'll start giving yourself new goals everytime you go out. Maybe you can do some volunteering which will bolster your work skills, get you out of the house and interacting with people. I'm not an expert but definitely tell family and see a doctor

Alright let‚Äôs use Tesla as an example. Let‚Äôs say on Monday the 12th I had $50000 to spend on call options. I could buy call options for $400 or for $600 with a 2 week expiration. The amount of options that I get will be wildly different because of the strike price. So what I want to know are the value of the 400 and 600 dollar options on the 12th

Yes, the CIA (or NSA) said that with their powerful software and hardware, they are now able to immitate any hacker profile and make it look like someone was hacked by a russian or a chinese. And it is impossible to detect it; just like the engineer who developed the electric voting booths and admitted in front of a judge that the results can be rigged and there would be no way to find out.

And this has been declared a few years ago, so i imagine what they hid from us then and what they are hiding now.

How the fuck do you deal with something that hurts your body? Or your mind? Genuinely asking from someone coming out of long term depression. All I know when there is any sort of pain, is drink. There is no way I will live a happy life honestly. I‚Äôm 23 and for the past 5 years I‚Äôve drank to drain out my mind. This shit won‚Äôt stop. I wish I could go out to the middle of nowhere and live by myself and have no one care about me. Shit should be so much simpler.

Doesn't someone need to actually buy those FEYE calls at 3:33pm in order for you to profit? So if I'm holding 100 calls, who would want to buy them at that time?
Hey, where can I find price candles for options? Any website that gives that information? My broker only gives the current value and no historicals.
Because the stock is ridiculously overvalued and even with Elon hitting every goal the valuation doesn't match reality. It has defied logic so far though... I'll just watch from the sidelines.

**[Antonov An-124 Ruslan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov An-124 Ruslan)**

The Antonov An-124 Ruslan (Ukrainian: –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–≤ –ê–Ω-124 –†—É—Å–ª–∞–Ω, lit. 'Ruslan'; NATO reporting name: Condor) is a large, strategic airlift, four-engined aircraft that was designed in the 1980s by the Antonov design bureau in the Ukrainian SSR, then part of the Soviet Union (USSR). Until the Boeing 747-8F, the An-124 was, for thirty years, the world's heaviest gross weight production cargo airplane and second heaviest operating cargo aircraft, behind the one-off Antonov An-225 Mriya (a greatly enlarged design based on the An-124). The An-124 remains the largest military transport aircraft in current service.

Probably Republicans but I hope for a democratic victory. That green new deal and Marijuana legalization would carry me to new heights.
The thing is, the 695 price was basically available for one second as one trade block at close and then instantly dropped. If the person holding my options didn't have the capital to exercise, I sort of imagine my broker wouldn't be able to sell the shares for >690 and would take a loss.  I would also imagine the broker wouldn't want that.

They did confirm I'll know on Sunday if it got auto-executed but couldn't say whether or not it would be.

Cliche for a trading forum I know but this advice works here. Never let success be the only option. It creates fear and desperation if the success is threatened or if it doesn't work out. The problem isn't she said no, it's that you set yourself up that her saying no wasn't an option and you staked too much of yourself in the wager.

You lost this one. You'll win another one, but next time don't all-in on an emotional binary event and allow failure to be just as acceptable as success.

I‚Äôve read some of his stuff because I‚Äôm always interested in different perspectives. He‚Äôs become popular because he correctly called for the market to moon post election and into the end of the year and implied vol to continue to bleed massively. My issue with him is that he talks in certainties (always a red flag to me when it comes to markets) and when someone is like ‚Äúwait such and such didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù he gets salty AF and plays the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just too dumb to understand‚Äù card. Then people ask how he comes up with levels and he says it‚Äôs magic. Seems a little snake oily to me. I get the reflexivity angle but the problem to me is that it doesn‚Äôt seem to allow for external risk factors that option dealers can‚Äôt control. The whole trade seems to be a very long winded way of saying ‚Äúvolatility is super expensive and likely not going to be realized especially with seasonal tailwinds and realized vol suppression due to dealer hedging.‚Äù I knew a lot of very clever traders who in the months leading up to volmageddon were very short the vix and were not shy about talking mad shit about how smart they were until one day the impossible happened and it blew up in their face. Personally I‚Äôm always wary of anyone who pretends to ‚Äúknow‚Äù something for sure wrt markets. But yeah, people who make some well timed calls tend to attract large followings.

You are fine. What happen was your short leg got exercised AH so it is showing you owe that amount.  Your long leg hasn't been exercised yet to cover it. It should balance out at open on Monday. Your broker will automatically exercised your long leg to cover the difference.  Let this be a lesson. If this is to happen on expiring options you could be fucked.  Brokers can have up until 5:30pm to exercised ITM calls, so if stocks shoot up AH, your short leg could get exercised without you realizing it. By the time you know of it, it would be too late for you to exercise your long leg to cover.

Those 695 is market on close order. Prior to close the stock is near like 650 ish so if you did place your market on close chance you won't get this price.

Samumed - probs the closest people rn to cure your dad's and your future bald head with drugs

Robinhood - the meme potential alone has me sweaty

Stripe - although I dunno whats going down with SPAC talks

Chime - basically Robinhood but for banking

and probs another gazillion I can't list

Today was OpEx so when everyone cashed out their calls today it was a delta bomb. Then funds bought up shares right at close (71M volume lol) before it gets included into the S&P 500 on Monday.
The buyer got lucky here. When the bell rang they were OTM his/her broker automatically expires the contracts and its auto designated ‚Äòdo not exercise‚Äô (DNE) because they were OTM. Every broker is different, but on Think or Swim you can open the contract (NLT 5:30 pm ET) and change this designation or call customer support and they will do it for you. Then, in this case, you would need $14.5k in settled cash to buy these long shares when the Options Clearing Corp settles it all tomorrow. Strike price+premium> than current share price since they‚Äôre barely ITM AH, but it‚Äôs better than $0.

Bro this is deadass me HAHA
Dude I'd do that for free. That sounds incredibly fun and satisfying. I wish I played the meta level more when I was in MMOs
>imagine selling amd at the very bottom of the dive today. could not be me... yea could not be me... HEH could DEFINITELY NOT be ME...

HAHAHAHAH buying high selling low??? COULD NOT BE ME!!! only AUTISTS do that shit
My employer pays for it. Worth it if you are comfortable with your expense ratio
i mean we're all a LITTLE dump, but that talks the cake
That escalated quickly.
Like more money? I think there's a correction coming and another series of bull runs for next year. This QE shit hasn't come close to finishing.
A friend who happens to be a girl I was interested in farted in my presence once and I've never spoken to her again.
I feel like that's such an ego boost. Imagine having billions in your bank account but you dress like you're just gonna watch netflix and eat all day that's such a power move.
üêª gang rise! Œ∏ gang also welcome.
I sold my NIO calls down 40% a few months back at 18 right before they went on the insane run.
okay gypsy rose lee
It's all insulting to be honest. If you were actually really struggling, even 1200 would only help for a month... Maybe
She'll know when you can't pay her
All I've found is that exact same thing. The insiders will have the right to offload 1.7b shares in a timeframe of a few days, and Thiel already prepared to do so by converting 14m shares to class A. Sure there is the possibility that they won't do it, but have if I had a few million shares I wouldn't mind offloading half of it for a good price.
how dump or wise I am , I bought few put of dash at close dec 31 strike 145
For real. Some people hate money and want to watch the world burn
You‚Äôre overthinking it. We‚Äôre heading into a v shaped recovery. A vaccine is rolling out. The Fed reaffirmed 0% interest rates. And a stimulus bill is being passed. The answer is calls. Who gives a fuck what the market does at specific hours of the day. Buy calls. Hold them longer than 30 seconds.
You lick it
But your clothes have holes in them
The greatest African American to have ever lived
Lol who‚Äôs even shorting Tesla these days. It‚Äôs so stupid. Meanwhile I have puts. Rip
This looks like someone fleeing the country after some particularly degenerate options gambling.
imagine selling amd at the very bottom of the dive today. could not be me... yea could not be me... HEH could DEFINITELY NOT be ME...
As we know.. incredibly difficult to do.
Not me either :(
The thing abt being in shit money situatiin is you see it as a way to get shit you need but can't afford, can't have the temptation
Dumped my calls down 40%, next day they go up 450%
Not sure if it's of topic or not, but I got two donations on my Twitch stream today. 10,000 bits and $25USD. It's a win, it's the thought that counts.
its a gay bar they'll know
As a üåà üê®, the only ticker I won't touch is GME. That shit has nine lives.
Honestly, I can't prove I'm the same person when I wake up.
Who‚Äôs buying at 700$? The short sellers who are about to get SQUEEZED

ugh yes they do retard they have lots of ips and products. The pltr tool i saw demoed looks like something out of the 90s and something a tool like Quid could probably do
This is actually terrifying.
Are we buying GME shares again?? WSB buying power is not to be fucked with
Lol, ok.
It's ok dude, don't sweat it
Sell before that, then buy again after that.. duh
Every time I get a few shares they shit the bed again
Sorry dude.
they figured it out because they got hacked
Beyond insulting.

There‚Äôs pay phones still? Where?

Citron research üçã. They keep the market efficient.
debit is a scam, you literally get nothing out of it

always use credit. only spend what you can afford to pay and always pay on time. build up credit score, earn points and its interest free if you pay in full every month
I believe Elliot wave theory holds value when applied correctly to long time scales, be it mapping price action or just human sentiment, the results often fit the conceived pattern prediction.
Just use Thinkorswim. They have a ‚Äúon demand‚Äù button that lets you buy/sell historical options and stocks and lets you change the dates to see how they moved.
Got in at around 26$ and sold CC along the way, so average is around 20$... No CC for now on the shares so let‚Äôs üöÄ! I‚Äôm long term on this gem!
You are up like 500% and scared? Fucking paper hand
Papa Elon makes both Billy and Jefe question their manhoods!
Seems like he knows something. I‚Äôm gonna be all in next Monday on those $20 calls

Hey dumbass, what was the actual price of TSLA in 2017?

You might want to keep your head down, being new AND dumb...
My mistake I see that now
We've all been there. I lost a big chunk on September 3rd. I'm almost green af now. Don't chase losses and make safe plays
Ber fuk
what do you mean yes and no, they were fucking hacked retard
Lowkey makes sense with our healthcare
You're missing out on credit card points by cutting them out. You must be terrible with money if you aren't responsible enough to use a credit card and pay it off before the statement.
Look for a couple comment above, dude posted about wsb sentiment which seems to be what you‚Äôre looking for . Figured you might not see his comment since he posted after you. I felt like doing something nice. Can you put in a good word for me to your wife‚Äôs boyfriend would love for him to try my wife
I feel you bro. Missed two ten baggers this week coulda broken even.

But there will always be more chances ahead just gotta stay optimistic. It‚Äôll get better

I want to get back in. Just sold my last batch of shares for 695. I‚Äôm going to start selling weekly puts for 600 or 580 or something and hope I get assigned lol.
Wait, you mean the previous generation isn't immediately embracing something new? Fuck me, sell it all
The stimulus is literally talking about a stimulus itself.
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
This strikes close.
When the fed chair says stonks aren‚Äôt high you fucking buy - no need to overthink...how are people losing money again?...shiet
Use the card you get points, just set a low spending limit if you don't trust yourself. Free money.
That‚Äôs what I saw as well. What are these bulls talking about? The deadline for the stimmy was today, they passed an emergency bill to work over the weekend. If
It‚Äôs not passed this weekend there‚Äôs no stimulus right?

God damnit! I actually read that link. Then verified it. That shit sucks. Fuck that dude. I‚Äôm one of the retards who panic sold, after musk said his shits too expensive
It will only happen when a big company succeeds at making a similar vehicle without having to use any hardware or software created by TSLA. I think all of the over valuation is based on the ridiculous thought that Elon Musk is the only person in the world capable of creating successful, self driving, electric car technology.

Yeah temporary PR dip, remember when they dragged that Chinese dude out of United flight and the stock tanked for like a few days only to bounce back higher
You rich bitch.  Cash 80 percent if you scared.
Bravo, that‚Äôs one of the best burns I‚Äôve read here in a while.
R u illiterate?
It will go far
Tesla was being added to the S&P 500 today. Because of that, not only was TSLA bought en masse by Standard & Poor's, but any indexes that track the S&P500 also needed (or will need) to buy TSLA to accurately reflect the index. Institutional buyers ended up buying 71.6 million shares in the space of about five seconds, completely dwarfing all volume for the week. Look at the volume bars on the bottom of the chart and notice how the bars that used to be fairly tall become only a couple of pixels high as soon as the next tick loads.
Either way, you‚Äôre winding up ded eventually.
Woohoo. Also, I wish his hair was bigger in the photo
I dunno if you can call furries normies.
Positions?
That's fucking quitter talk.  If you lose it all on PLTR, you get Super-Autism, go suck some dicks on the corner, and use that money to hop on the rocket for the next $MEME stock.  That's specifically where the "Gay" in "Gay Bears" comes from.
Post at the top is this sub's creation.  That guy is WSB.
Oh he's not married, lives with his brother.  Bot of an oddball, 100% subscribes to wsb.

Im actually not sure if this signals a crash anymore.

Looks like you getting fucked nice and hard.  I don't need to insult you when I know that is a fact.
Cathie Wood saying they expect 20% over the next 5 years, isn't that a little sketchy saying she expects x% over a period of time? I mean they are knocking it out of the park so maybe it is justified!
When I met my girldfriend she was 2 hours away also. Now we have been togethet for 10 years. If shes worth it and its not permanent I would try it out just to see how it goes.
the better question would be, why AREN'T you?

I don‚Äôt even know what to buy options for or if I should make calls or puts. These few days have all seemed like we go up, then it‚Äôs a steady decline all day. Then goes up big at the end of the day or week, and then it goes back down again and we go right back where we started.

What is your price target for this food delivery service stock lol
I did start with Robinhood a long time ago, but I've pretty much fully moved over to TDA now (exception being Robinhood for fractional shares). I just prefer line to candle as it creates a more clear narrative over time without adding too much visual clutter. If I really want to know OHLC, I can just hover over that tick in TDA and the info will be displayed at the top, but, frankly, I really don't care if someone in Bumfuck, Kansas got assigned at 0.3% over close for that tick. I care at what price my positions were opened and where they will close. Line is a good enough summary of any individual tick for me to get that info fast without getting too hung up on the details.
Preach. It's a low margin consulting company, and most DD on here is like 'look at the CEO's hair' lol.

Once you‚Äôre in the real world you‚Äôll be a balding simp swiping Tinder all night and getting one like back in a week if you‚Äôre lucky. And she‚Äôll ghost you when you say Hi. Like that dude says in Road Trip, when you‚Äôre older you‚Äôll have to pay for those girls.

I‚Äôm joking a little, but the truth I wish I‚Äôd known is, it‚Äôs a lot easier to meet people when you‚Äôre 19 and you just have so many more opportunities. As you get older it gets harder and harder to meet new people.

How is it not already priced in? They already said they are passing it shortly. I thought the market discounted the future? So we can't price in a stimulus the day before it passes, but we can price in a recovered economy a year or two out? Alrighty.

DASH probably. I made some good money off of puts right after market open (since Citron attacked and shorted it yesterday), but it seems like (again SEEMS like, don't wanna get too conspiratorial) MMs pumped it up and then pinned it to make most of those newly bought puts expire totally worthless. As a result, I think we'll see a lot of the stock's value slip over the next few weeks and months, today (and maybe short term) will be like a dead cat bounce

It's not a glitch, it's just how RH chooses to display the price of the option. Since there weren't any bids on one of your legs, RH displayed the price as $0.01

It's not a glitch because other brokers are showing the same thing, tons of options with lots of value are showing no bids. Some brokers choose to display the price as the last transaction price, some choose a different method. RH chooses to just use the middle price, but since there isn't a bid, they just show $0.01

The buyer has until 17:30 ET to notify "do not exercise‚Äù or ‚Äúdo exercise" for their option. The buyer in this situation may have neglected to close. The buyers broker could have auto exercised the contract because it was $5 ITM at the bell. TD auto exercises anything over $0.01 ITM.

They'll just give it to you if they are being nice (you just pay a 2 day weekend fee). The problem is if they don't exercise it, you lose 500 bucks, since the option is worth 5 but you'll get 0 if you choose to not exercise it. Margin will cost less than that 500 for 2 days so it's possible your account can go negative temporarily. Check Sunday to see if you got the 100 shares or not (if not they just overrode the exercise for you). If you do have it and can't afford it, you'll automatically get temporary margin, get a margin call, but as long as you sell Monday you are fine. Just wake up early and sell pre market even.

There's one other thing that could have happened. If it happened consider TDA an amazing broker. They could have sold short 100 shares of stock for you AH today. If they did, you owe them a huge thanks. That way it costs no margin, you still get the 500 (-whatever you paid) and you have no risk over the weekend. Check to see if that happened also.

Up is up buddy you are doing alright. Plenty of people on here losing more than they can afford to- instead of taking solace, take pride in success however minor.
Can you summarise pls
ok but how much money do they make? they are not going to capture the entire TAM...
Why does she want to start college in a relationship anyway?  Not worth the hassle for either of you.  Plus you‚Äôve only been together for a year, it‚Äôs not like y‚Äôall have invested a ton of time and energy and emotion in to this.  End it on a good note and move on with your life.

2 hours ain't that bad if you're really down with the chick. Hell some jobs I've worked Id driven 8 hours round trip. Odds are you'd sleep over and smash.
If it was ITM they will exercise it.  They might charge you a hefty fee.  I think I was charged like 250 on Etrade when I did this as an experiment one day.  No idea about TDA.

I completely understand. Letting go is literally the hardest thing you‚Äôll have to do. I thought the girl I let go of was my dream girl and I tossed and turned for days after I let her go. Ended up hurting me for a while but I met someone else and everything couldn‚Äôt be better. It will suck bro don‚Äôt let anyone tell you different. You‚Äôll be lonely and think what if? But just spend time with friends and family or focus on work and you‚Äôll get through it. Always hold your head high and don‚Äôt focus too much on what if‚Äôs and the past

What interests me is their range of solutions and their connections. If you go on their site they provide examples of their software helping all sorts of companies, from Ferrari to Sales to Insurance companies. 


They are also networked to the chest, whether it be multi billion dollar companies or governments across the world - giving them ins on contracts.

If it's a margin account, it's possible there's some small adjustments every night. But it shouldn't be more than a few dollars at most (most likely a few cents). Like if it's hundreds of dollars, that's an issue.

Actually you want to buy the shares in this case. Then borrow margin for the weekend. Sell at open Monday. I think that's standard actually. It's a lot less costly than not exercising at all if the intrinsic was not some value very close to 0.

Bitch, who? Who the fuck is going to buy this *now*?! The buying is done. There‚Äôs no one left to buy. November to now was all the speculators. They bought in **specifically** for this event. Now the event is over. What do you think those speculators are gonna do now?

Does it bother you? Placing yourself as an individual ahead of everyone else in the world is necessary for survival sometimes. Ignoring the feelings of others, even ignoring their right to exist can be a path to great wealth and power. If you don't feel any pangs of conscience over your treatment of others it makes life a lot easier.

I don't feel this way, but I've known people who do.
Ey bro, if you can YOLO to the moon, you can ask that girl for her number.

Worst comes to worst, she‚Äôll leave scars on your back and you‚Äôll block her from FaceB.

Gotta love this simulation. Tesla has gained half a trillion(~515b) since the CEO said it was overvalued seven and a half months ago. Revenues, profits, etc, more or less the same.
I‚Äôve eaten one and haven‚Äôt had Covid. So it must be true. I also masturbate 4 times at least everyday so it could also be that
It will definitely not be 300 in March. But it will be 250.
I don't actually think it's going to hit that haha - but they were cheap and the price went from .5 to 1.29 since I bought em! Hopefully I'll be able to dump them for an even better profit on monday.
Doesn't it automatically exercise for you and sell the difference?
Obviously you know what you're doing. Otherwise, you wouldn't have buttloads of cash from all the investments that paid off for you. You don't have to borrow money like us simpletons....

Excellent DD! Get information from you in these posts. Really excellent work.
No, why the fuck would going without food for a week be beneficial.
Possibly, but there are not that many busses. 

It's more long haul trucking. When you transport over long distances the truck is not really a limiting factor, it's the driver who needs to sleep after a certain amount of hours driven. At that point your truck will stand still doing nothing (wasted resources) and your products stand there doing nothing (also wasted resources).

If these trucks could drive 24/7 without a break transportation companies would require fewer trucks and they could increase their transportation capacity while at the same time saving money on driver salaries. It is just a win win win situation.

EV is for sure going to dominate the market at some point. Will tesla dominate the EV market? No, they are already not in some areas.

Also, even though people might think apple is dominating the smart phone market, they are not. Globally they account for only like ~15% of the sales. Samsung and Huawei each individually have a higher market share.

The reason why the iphone is still worth that much is not the iphone sales, but the fact that they are tied to the app store.

I don't think you'll get all 6. If you do, that means you got an unlikely counterparty match. You probably will get a fraction or even possibly 0. I wouldn't mind getting short like 200 shares imo here (so 2 get exercised). Worst case is you wake your ass up at 4 AM Monday and buy first thing when premarket opens.

It won't be immediate since the Options Clearing has to assign the counterparty and that takes time. You'll know by Sunday for sure, maybe earlier like Saturday.

VW ID.3 is outselling Tesla in Europe since release.

Then there is the Porsche Taycan, Audi e-tron, Mercedes EQC, Nissan Leaf, Hyundai KONA.

And next year you'll have the ford SUV EV.

Maybe the hype machine isn't taking those seriously, but customers are, because they're selling more than Tesla in some areas.

Seems like people here are upvoting / downvoting based on opinion rather than actually looking at EV Sales

Seriously a 10/10 and I've never rated a girl more than  a 9. She dressed up so well

She was a bitch though, paranoid, and always fighting.

It's not tesla. It's Musk. The biggest con man this country ever seen. Dude is selling dreams and illusions. Self driving capability - pay in advance hefty price... When is it coming, maybe tomorrow, maybe in 3 years.. Maybe never. Use cheap electricity to drive, save on gas! But pay at last twice the price of a gas car!
Gigafactory seams like it's missing QC line! Great way to save! .. Make customers your QC inspectors. For free! That should do it.
They might sell 500k this year. Wow! Realy? Toyota sells that many Rav4s just in North America! And makes like 3 times more money on each of them. 
Look Ma"! I am going to Mars! When? How? Well, my rocket can do flip moves in the air and lands like a candle, except when it explodes... Another fantasy of super rich rocket man payed by dreamy fanboys.
But but but... His tweets are so deep and smart, and edgy and funny.. And he don't give a f.... How cooollll. Take my money! Now I can go to the barr and try to score some pussy by showing off my new tesla share...awsome.
Print, apparently.  But I'm bullish on it after reading its financial statements.

Calls have to be exercised by 5:30 right? So if I talked to my broker around 7 and they said the calls I sold that went ITM AH expired worthless then I dodged the bullet?

Maybe in America, but not necessarily everywhere in the world. The best selling EV in Norway is a Volkswagen. In China it‚Äôs a GM, in France it‚Äôs the Renault. Germany it‚Äôs the Renault. Look up the stats of you don‚Äôt believe me.

The Renault Zoe and the Volkswagen ID.3 aren‚Äôt sold in the USA, for multiple different reasons, such as we don‚Äôt sell any Renaults in the states. Tesla might be the only electric car people want to buy around you personally, but not the case of the world.

Oh thank you.  How poker took over my mind and fucked my life up.  All I did for year for years was play besides caring for my dogs (god bless them) and if it wasn't for them I'd likely be dead.
I work in the industry, ore is the old way. All new mills are electric arc and designed to melt scrap from recycling. 

Used to work for the most profitable mill per ton produced and they bought a mine for something like 750mil just to moth ball it due to scrap being cheaper even when they owned the mill too.

Love making money using a leverage. There is absolutely nothing wrong about it. Just because you are a wsb retard and lost money in this market instead of making a killing, is your problem, not for anyone else.
Based on my current analysis and forecasting models, I predict that the next major retrace against the hikirodojimufasa cloud will occur when SPY touches the 69420 second adjusted moving average at 371.92 at roughly 11:31:07AM on Tuesday, 12/22 triggering a massive correction to 370.33 before resuming the reverse drills to new ATH
9.84
BTFD retard!

Or just keeping waiting for this crash forever. It ain't coming.

There will be dips and small corrections through the journey but a March style crash will never happen.

One particular observation about working in tech is that the most successful people have an ability to stay focused and sit in their chairs for an uncanny amount of time. 

I can sit and focus for about 1-2 hours a day of peak work, the rest of my day is just fluff. No wonder other people are so much more productive, they‚Äôre getting 3-4x as much focused work done that I am. Damn.
The average reddit user is pathetic.  I imagine them all to be freakishly tall ugly gingers with wispy beards.

>pointing to what he sees as the growth still to come.

>‚ÄúThe next big thing is fourth-quarter deliveries, when Tesla could reach 500,000 deliveries for the year,‚Äù 

Combine the 2 largest automakers and you get a company that ships 20 million vehicles a year and has about half the market cap of Tesla.

I agree. I just don't see the reason to buy fd's when a recovery is going to take time to climb back that fast. It's a situation where you play it with either monthlies (taking gains gradually) or with otm leaps. No need to hit home runs all the time
Tesla will also become the next uber/lyft and it will actually be profitable
Might go up or down or stay the same. If you‚Äôre down just hold the shit, bro
This spread strategy assumes you have shares held as well right? Because you can only sell calls if you have the shares to back it up
Good spot.  Out of all the tragic losers, know-nothings, degenerates, trust funds kids, middle aged cucks et al that populate this subreddit people who fake positions for karma are the worst.
Fair, fair, but I got these contracts for cheap, so I'm just gonna swing these. If ABBV hits \~$105-$106, I will make a bunch of moneyyy. Might get in on some later contracts possibly in mid 2021 or early 2022 for some OTM calls.

I actually exited because I felt like it was going to bounce due to shorts covering. There would of been so much pressure on the stock from when it IPO'd. All it would take is a tiny bit of green for all the shorters to cover and take their profits. I think Monday will be the real test. If it's red it'll probably resume the dump. If it's green then we are just in a bubble and ABNB and DASH to 200 lets go.

Covid is trashing social relationships these days. It is tough when you're older but in normal times there are options. Meet up groups (there are multiple websites for them), volunteering groups, exercise groups, adult sports leagues, sports bars that support specific teams, religious or philosophical groups.

Also try to think about how many people are suffering and how you can brighten their day by being friendly and encouraging. Even if you feel like shit, making them better will make you feel better. People are attracted to positivity nowadays especially. You can share your struggles once they trust you.

It was NOT Oxy. OXY was replaced from the S&P 100. Tesla replaced Apartment Investment and Management (AIV) in the S&P 500 (the one that matters). It is a REIT that just recently spun off one of its divisions.
Landslide killed one person at one of their mines. Feel bad for the guy and his family. As far as the stock drop it was an over reaction.

PLTR can't just "look" at all their data, they're not a spying entity that can  just back door anybody or any components' data. I say that dead serious because I'm pretty sure everyone on WSB thinks that they can, and can see anything in the digital realm at any given time, and that PlTR has spies on the ground. But then again this is WSB so that isn't surprising, that people believe that.
Does vanguard have it?

Oh. The demo? ...
My trading background is a little different man. I been following the market since my highschool days, but only started trading myself after closing my account with my broker in March due to a disappointment in returns after 5yrs. Anyway, I'm pretty much flat since March, as much as it kills me to say. I've made a solid number of good trades, but I made one trade which cleaned out almost half my account. I've recovered since then, but it's taken me months to get back to basically the starting point. Overall, I'm up about 2k this yr which is a joke of a return considering the way the market has moved, but I take solace in knowing I've learned a lot more trading on my own than having someone manage my account for me. How about you?

Absolute fucking retard. What is new or innovative about food delivery? Margins are shit, DASH has never turned a profit, and has continued failing to do so even during a pandemic when they're being propped up by more orders than normal due to restaurant closures.

I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm gonna regret buying a model 3 in 2-4 years depending on my gains. I‚Äôve already made enough to afford half the car but I‚Äôm not sure how much longer Tesla will keep it‚Äôs steam - is it too high expectations to expect 15% profit per year for the next 10-15 years?
Nah bro, it will move T up. The question is how much and if the baby boomers will load T up based on the added subs. This is uncharted territory.  When Mulan premiered, it was an expensive $30 add on with a shit load of anti Chinese sentiment.  Wonder Woman will fare much better especially with the $15 price tag plus watching other shows for 31 days.  It definitely will push up a few bucks after Christmas.
fuck yeah i do. it won't be up every single day and a bad day is no indication of anything.
I was expecting a bid dip today, mostly cos of quadruple witching ,but also cos big money would have want to drop the price before having to buy the shares.

This is the way
The stim is weak af. Flat unless the stipulation that no additional funds for fed pumps and no possibility for fed pump money in the future is included, then it‚Äôs going to be bloody.
In my experience with a buy out the company gets bought at a fixed price per share. Usually a big jump but sometimes it can go down. There's an exchange price. So if Tesla buys Nikola 1000 shares of NKLA now becomes 35 shares of TSLA. I think they may actually cash you out some fractional money although now with fractional shares maybe not.

For options I would assume they just use the conversion rate between the shares to calculate new values.

So ITM call contracts on NKLA would now give the right to buy equivalent TSLA shares.

But I'm just guessing. Ask your brokerage if you think this could actually happen.

I'm sorry bro.  On the flip side, I held the position through close and could've been assigned TSLA shares.  I ignored the volatility panic by working.  I was just like "this can't go tits up.". But it could have.

Depending on what servers were attacked, this maybe the case. Pentagon, FBI, and CIA servers a likely target. All that's needed is a PR announcing evidence of the hackers' origins and Palantir's role in tracking them.

Big win maybe on the way.
If TSLA is flat on Monday this entire sub will get wiped out
It wasn't price manipulation, they all placed market buy orders because they want to track the indexes closely as possible. That's kind of their job. So the huge surge was a massive amount of fund buying. Now it's done. Some funds will still trickle buy and sell orders in, but the bulk of it is over.

Hope you don't mind a story. I'm in New Zealand for context. Had a job managing a major national health screening programme. Covid hit, had to wind down national health programme and pivot entire team to covid response, as well as set up another team for internal reviews.

All this in lockdown with my wife who is in aged care with two under fives at home. It was devastating, kids wanted to hang and we were both busy all the time. Felt super trapped and helpless. Quit the job, changed career, dropped 17kg, now fit and healthy. More time with the kids. 


Fuck Covid, but I'm grateful for how it reduced the importance I place on work and increased my family bond. 

Now I just need to yolo some memes all the way to the moon. I'm new here, am I doing it right?

I'm glad you asked. Firstly, anything you invest in is a risk. In terms of risk to this play,id rate it a 3 out of 10. The end goal is to beat the corporations shorting the absolute fuck out this stock.The fact that there is more than 100% shares shorts vs float,is a sentiment to what GME gang is up against. In my researched opinion, any price under 20 is a discount. Anyone in this play is going to make profit as long as you get in sooner rather than later. These past few days for example, a lot of shorts (approx. 1 million) shares were closed out of their short position and the stock soared ~20% due to the buying volume along with confidence of the GME gang coming back. ///thought #2///
Gamestop is not a dying company. They have so much cash on hand, a solid customer base, the interest of Ryan Cohen to turn this company around. Fundamentally this stock should be 30-40 consistently in my opinion. When the MOASS kicks off, could see a chain reaction from anywhere $100-1000 depending on how crazy the shitshow gets. End game is shorts have to cover at some point. We have a lot of shares under WSB's belt. 5-10% collectively. We get to make the price that the shorts cover their positions on.
so does psych grow up to be monk?
The future is here!
Wtf are we here for then?

TSLA 1000 eow
With the fed backing the market, right now is the best time to go hard into tech. This is Cathy woods thesis anyways, and a big reason why she‚Äôs going mega hard into speculative growth stocks. Play the stocks arkk picked and those are all nutty plays(all holdings on website)My favorite tickers are SE(southeast Asian e-commerce+fintech+gaming), U(‚Äòdemocratize‚Äô gaming engine+platform for 3D/AR and all that good stuff for the our world‚Äôs further digitization in the future), and FVRR(fiverr, the leading platform for freelancers, with FB recently coming out with an alternative, which shows you how valuable this market potentially could be). All of these have gone up a lot but I still think they are good holds for the future. They could all turn to shit if this turns out to be another bubble. However, Cathy Wood said in one of her interview, (paraphrasing here) ‚Äúthe dotcom bubble sow the seeds for tech‚Äôs future. With costs going down and fields like genomics, AI, and etc all developing at a rapid pace at the SAME TIME, innovation could potentially develop at an accelerated rate like we have never seen before.‚Äù 
TLDR; Covid came, market dropped, fed backs the market, money goes into tech and not value due to fear of lockdown, tech uses this opportunity to grow, upcoming fourth industrial revolution. Very far fetch, but opportunity like this don‚Äôt come many times in our lives. Yolo ü§°

Robo Taxi is a big pass as individual transport.
For mass transport absolutely, but that's not their target at all.
EV's are much better for low speed, start / stop environments as opposed to ICEs which makes them poised to replace current delivery platforms / mass transit.
The idea of a large amount of individual transports doesn't get over the inefficient cost / use basis. In fact it actually makes it much much worse. Think of, "what's cheaper to operate and maintain, a single electric bus that transports 2,500,000 passengers over it's life time; or, 50 electric cars that transport 50,000 passengers each?

I'd say get out early. Don't try to get as much as possible. The stock may go up on open, tank mid-afternoon but may recover from there. Whether that's on Monday close or later in the week, I don't know, but people have mostly been bullish on TSLA outside of regulars (who will tank it Monday). So the way I see it, if it falls red, it'll invite investments (and rebound). That will most likely be the only window you'll get this week. It's just my speculation of how TSLA operates from my experience of tracking it - I'm not a financial advisor by any means.

I see a small dip around the 3:00 to 3:10 that this post indicates (and then a big one around 3:30). People thought Tesla was about to tank?

Thats why they suck. We're so primitive that we have to use pronouns to be able to communicate with and understand eachother, and is a damn shame. I wish we could send our sentiment without having to navigate the puzzle code of words and linguistics.

Don't get me wrong, I believe there is space for appreciation of it in arts and literature, but its the fact that we absolutely have to do it. There's no option. And its unfair to make it mandatory.

 Why can't I just show somebody how to play violin and have them immediately know the skills I have. Why do I have to pursue an interpersonal dichotomy of mental gymnastics and code things in to words and numbers and take a slow linear approach to basically emulate the learning experience i went through to learn the violin. Why can't I just pass on that understanding? 

Its not just pronouns that suck. Its the fact that we're so limited that pronouns are actually important. 

I wish somebody could start some futuristic technology company that strives to cut out the middle man that is our physical limitations. 

I cant tell you how I beat my heart, maybe a cardiologist can but he can't do it any better than you or I. That limitation breaks both of our hearts, yet because of that limitation we cannot feel the pain it causes us.

To be clear, not really looking to take this big of a risk at first but I don‚Äôt understand what y‚Äôall‚Äôs endgame is. Are you trying to drive up the stock because you have options to buy it for a low price? What happens when you all try to dump it once you‚Äôve bought it? Wouldn‚Äôt it just crash before you can offload it?
This. I didn‚Äôt enter those positions looking for quick gains. I invest for the long term and cash flow spiting off it to reinvest in itself or use it to buy other stocks. ABBV is a big hitter in the dividend growth area too which I plan to drip until the stock gets a little

Just FYI pretty much no one refers to each contract as 100 shares. When I read your higher up post I thought you had had 200 shares, plus a 16.5 call. Just say 2 16.50 calls or 16.5 C
I thought I smelled a top near by

Very safe spreads, covered calls and cash covered puts, im talking 75% percent chance of it working in your favor. I would say I would feel comfortable with around 100k, depends on how much you need to live on, assuming my wife still keeps her job I would need 2-3k per month to live pretty decent

I still have 4530 shares of TSLA in my regular trading account along with 85 TSLA call options of various strikes and expirations with two of them +2000%.  So I'm ok if TSLA doesn't pull back.  To be honest, when I put in the sell limit order, TSLA within the last 5 minutes of trading went from green to -3%, so I didn't think my sell order was going to execute anyways.  It was only at the close when I checked my portfolio that I realized the sell order actually went through.

[removed]
The closing price is whatever the stock closed at plus or minus the strike depending on your position. Say you want to know the price of tsla. On March Tsla closed at 500 your strike was 400 and you had a call. It's worth 100 for that day. Say it closed at 399, then it closed worthless. Say it closed at 420. Then it closed at 20.
So I've bought and sold TSLA several times in my 401k knowing I wouldn't be taxed (yet).  I believe I started buying TSLA back in March with my 401k.  Unfortunately Fidelity has some pretty bad reporting tools, so it's a chore to figure out the actual price.  When I first started trading TSLA in my 401k it was worth \~$764k.  But since I've bought and sold when TSLA went up and down (different number of shares), can't really say what the average price was.  But with current value at $3M, I gained $2.3M trading TSLA stock.
This makes me SLV calls get a hard on.

For context this is for Azure. The large public cloud providers are slowly heading this direction, Amazon already has an ARM CPU for AWS (the Graviton 1/2) ... I'd expect Google to eventually offer their own ARM VMs as well.

Yeah, I‚Äôve always just done a couple stocks at a time. I‚Äôm ok doing short term trades unless what I‚Äôm holding runs up hard and fast which happened with both. At a certain point the gains are pretty significant and I think the odds of beating the market or my current trade by more than the tax difference becomes pretty tough.

It‚Äôs like if I sell now I have to make 20% more on this money than if I hold it 6 more months, and that‚Äôs just to break even vs LTCG.

I already have a nice house and a 718 GT4.  My entire portfolio with my 401k and my individual trading account is $10.5M at close today.  However, most of my individual trading holdings is in TSLA stock (short term) and TSLA calls, so cashing those out would be a big tax bill (I'm guessing $2M).  As for retirement, my goal was to save $10M, but didn't expect that to happen this year.  Thought it would be 5-10 years from now.  At this point, I'm going to play the market a bit more conservatively, but would be bored if I were to retire now.
Just saw that the 500k PLTR yolo on the front page was a fake. It was making me feel better.

Your portfolio ain't diverse enough for 2021 man. You're going to get cancelled.
So basically the huge volume of shares that were traded potentially represent about 1.5% of the short positions that would have to be covered in the short squeeze if my math is right.
Yeah how isolated do you want. You can get that effect in the NE states as the population is low, it‚Äôs mountainous and not as developed. Also are still in distance to urban centers.

You aren't even concerned that your president-elect is tangled in CCP business deals.. straight up big yikes..

Exactly because of this type of partisan thinking, no common sense, and just straight up stupidity, china is eating US' lunch. 

On Russia, I didn't say they aren't a threat. Yeah they hacked, and? Iran does it too, China does it too ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/us/politics/china-hackers.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/us/politics/china-hackers.html)), so does North Korea. That's why they're called enemies...   
" I love that you believe only one matters. " typical r/politics bullshit. I am saying china is a bigger threat than russia for obvious reasons.. and I am talking here in terms of military, economy, geopolitical influence - actually what matters when we talk about superpowers and world dominance, not some cyberhack shit that any little nation-state can carry. 

Have an open mind dude. I am on your side, not against. People across the pond look at you all and think you are retarded, you all believe anything, invested too much in politics, and are gullible af.

I‚Äôm pretty new to this but I‚Äôll give you my understanding. The short sellers are obligated to buy the shares that they are short to repay a debt. They are banking on GME going down so they get to pay back way less money to cover those shares that they owe. But as GME goes up they‚Äôre going to be forced to buy shares at a higher prices to cover that debt. As they have to buy the shares, they have to buy from us, the people who own the shares. If we don‚Äôt fucking sell them the shares, it will make the share price shoot up because no one is going to want to sell them our shares for anything less than mad tendies. So if I‚Äôm understanding this correctly, we just sit on our shares and wait for all the shorts to give us their tendies. Also, calls are going to print to the moon and if you can time it, you stand to make mad tendies. Good luck and enjoy your stay in our casino

Yes to some degree, I don't really like b&s though, plenty of inaccuracies exist. Here's a basic breakdown of some from Investopedia:

&#x200B;

* Assumes constant values for¬†[risk free rate of return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freerate.asp)¬†and¬†[volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp)¬†over the option duration‚Äînone of those may remain constant in the real world
* Assumes continuous and costless trading‚Äîignoring [liquidity risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidityrisk.asp) and brokerage charges
* Assumes stock prices to follow¬†lognormal¬†pattern, e.g., a¬†[random walk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randomwalktheory.asp)¬†(or geometric Brownian motion pattern)‚Äîignoring large price swings that are observed more frequently in the real world
* Assumes no¬†[dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp)¬†payout‚Äîignoring its impact on the change in valuations
* Assumes no¬†[early exercise](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earlyexercise.asp)¬†(e.g., fits only¬†European options)‚Äîthe model is unsuitable for¬†American options
* Other assumptions, which are operational issues, include assuming no penalty or margin¬†requirements for short sales, no¬†[arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp)¬†opportunities  and no taxes‚Äîin reality, all these do not hold true; either additional  capital is needed or realistic profit potential is decreased¬†
Purely short 6 contracts...and terrified.   I can‚Äôt understand why I wouldn‚Äôt be immediately exercised on, so that I could repurchase the shares AH?   Why the delay?  Puts on my sleep.

Carbs are addiction. Best way for weight loss is transitioning to low carb 50-100 a day. Then keto which is less than 20 carbs a day. Once on keto for a few weeks start intermittent fasting. Once your comfortable with that, 1 meal a day. Once you get used to that extended fasting. All comes down to getting your body fat adapted. Currently your body runs on short term energy, carbs. Once you switch to long term energy you have stored as fat, the weight melts off. Check out r/keto and r/fasting

Think of it from the MMs perspective. There are always retards buying and selling options, but it‚Äôs the competing MMs that truly provide the liquidity and establish the spread. 

When things get really difficult to price, they either just exit the market for that option temporarily or set their prices very high (wide spread) to account for the uncertainty. They may not get much volume in this case, but it‚Äôs better than badly mispricing a sold option. 

When a stock behaves very erratically, it gets harder to price with ordinary formulas

That looks awesome!  I don't think there is anything wrong with using your cost basis on the stock as a point of reference for your options premium returns.  That's actually exactly how you should be thinking of it.  Hopefully overtime you get your cost basis to 0 or below and continue to hold on to the stock.  Looks like you got a bit more conservative with your calls over time by selling 2 weeks DTE instead of 30-45 DTE.  What was your reasoning behind it?  Just close calls with assignment or trying to capture more premium by selling twice a month instead of once?  

I've been in AMD since Sept and I've captured about 5% of the cost basis through calls.  I also got in it through selling puts and will occasionally sell additional puts where I don't plan to take assignment.  If I count up all of that option premium, I've captured about 10% of my AMD stock purchase cost basis.  I just discovered options this year but have also been selling covered calls on some stock I've been holding long term and captured about 18% of my cost basis on that stock.  The long term stock I try hard not to get assigned on so I'm conservative selling pretty far OTM.  But with AMD, I want to try to experiment and be more aggressive.  I think if it makes it over $100, that's when I'll start selling again.  Hopefully the news today about microsoft creating their own chips that caused a drop doesn't carry over into next week and we continue up to $100+.
They would have tanked it with their old ways

I dumped her because she was moving to Florida and I thought my ex would be more of a stable decision (fucking lol). As much as I hate Florida I know I would've preferred trying to make that work at least.
You know whats more annoying than losing? Profit, but minimal gains. I feel worse when I sell for 50% gains on options, only for the option to sell at 200% by eod. Fucking BB puts printed and I sold early.

Of course there is. Fairly complex though and each person's algorithm for options pricing differs from the other. As a rule of thumb its always handy to keep in mind the IV, volatility model, and probability cone.

Only ITM are auto excercised at expire.  If the holder doesn't have capitol to cover the shares, the brokerage sells them immediately and gives them the profit minus a fee.

If it's excercised early, it was done manually by the holder.

The auto excercised usually happens on Sunday though, at least in my experience.

You bought Calls or Puts?  You need to explain what you bought, why you bought it, and ‚Äî importantly ‚Äî why it cost, what it cost (is the premium worth it). Never fear your friends at WSB can help. 

Ps TSLA bulls are screwed next week.
I was told to not speak to my colleagues about my pay because they‚Äôre paying me almost double.
yeah in May and recovered fully after a month. One of my neighbors got it (both him and his wife) and they both got intubated and all that shit but recovered. then a few weeks later the wife developed legit psychosis and started doing crazy shit like walking out on the road into traffic. Before this she was just a normal ass mom helping her kids with school on Zoom. She ended up being put on a 72 hour psychiatric hold for being a "danger to self" which turned into like a month long hold. A lot of people don't give a fuck about covid because they think the only consequence is death and that they're too healthy for it but what's almost as terrifying are the morbidities that are still being discovered
In american style yes, options the buyer can excercise early. European ones no. remember though its on the buyer to exercise, so lets say your selling a 100$ call and on a stock thats currently 95 bucks. Lets say u got paid 500$ in premium, the buyers breakeven point is going to be 105$, because he paid that premium to you. So if the stock price goes to 102$ and theres still time until expirarion the buyer has no reason to exercise, since hed still be down 300$ overall. 

If your in this position as a buyer you could either keep holding until its about your breakeven point or resell the contract since it will now be worth more than u paid for it.

If they are not weeklies averaging down can help. I've done it in weeklies and ate shit when the dip kept dipping, so i don't do that anymore. 
  
Gotta know when to fold too.
I did the opposite. I found a stock with premium way too high to buy calls. So I thought I secured a guaranteed winning trade selling a put spread selling the 30 strike and buying the 22.5 for a $7.50 credit. Instead I bought the 30 and sold the 22.50 for a $7.50 debit. Best case scenario I keep $750 minus commissions. Worst case scenario it goes to zero.

But seriously, for medium/long term I am loving the ARK funds; they‚Äôve made me some good money in 3 months time.
No chance of a 'squeeze' I think, short interest is too low. I don't expect it too plummet to be honest but I ended the day with puts, bought right before that big drop followed by recovery.

Is there a way to calculate or determine if the mark or ask price of a call option is at a fair price? I understand most of the basics plus some with only specifically call options now- but sometimes I‚Äôm unsure if a call I want to buy is overvalued. Aside from DD on the company, is there a way to calculate in the strike, Greeks etc. to see what a fair buy price is?

I guess since op's strike isn't too far off, these might and probably will still print. 

But remember, what happened with ios 14, is in some sorts, the opening of pandora's privacy box which has already been cracking open since earlier this year.

That candle didn't show up on ThinkorSwim until after the close.  So it might be that your calls weren't updated on your broker, because that order was at the last millisecond.  Option prices aren't updated until the opening bell because you can't trade them after-hours, so you may be ok.  I hope so anyway, good luck.

Probably a good idea. There was some fool running around the other day threatening to sue everyone that was long GME.
Amazing. My Roth IRA is all ARK (and PLTR), praise be Mommy Cathie
So I am grabbing some #s from robinhood


So the march 30c for PLTR is 3.68
The march 45c for PLTR is 1.19

Now, if I am bullish on PLTR, I can buy the 30c, and if they top 33.68 I make money. And it can be unlimited because if every penny they go above 33.68 I make $1

But if I buy the 30c and sell the 45c, it only costs me $2.47. So I break even at 32.47. The limitation is if PLTR closes above 45, say 50, I am buying PLTR at 30 but I have to sell it at 45, meaning my max profit is 15 per share (1500 total)

That's a debit spread. I pay 247 for the ability to make a max of 1500.

I do it with SPY all the time. 366 share price at 2pm on tuesday,  I'll buy the 361 and sell the 362
 Costs me 90, and then as long as it closes above 362, I get 100 back, so I make $10. 11% 2x a week is fun. It's essentially 23% per week, 254% per month, etc

I usually do SPY on Wednesdays and MSFT on Fridays

I upped my stop losses daily (I wasn‚Äôt playing options quite yet), and by the end of that run I made more money than I ever had on any other play in the market in my life.  And that‚Äôs how I became a Cramer Stan.  Also he has a garden, and posts pics of making tomato sauce from scratch to his Twitter and I love it.

I got you, part of the process. i suppose its on you to double check before you execute. A lot of contracts had 0.00 bids. Is this because there was no contracts to buy at that point?   

I could just see somebody getting ready to execute on RH and the midpoint changing while they are trying to complete the trade and getting cucked for not taking it slower.

Low bids are not dirty. Standing orders at low prices are absolutely normal. What happened, which is also normal, is as volatility went insane MMs stepped out of the bid/ask completely so the spread got wider leaving behind only those standing orders.

The main issue here is that you still haven't actually said anything I'm disagreeing with. If you look at the shape of various theta curves they don't all look the same. I know what you're trying to say but you actually aren't skilled enough to say it because you don't understand it.

For example when you say that theta increases with time just looking at the graph of an ITM option shows that false immediately but theta does increase in magnitude of movement as you get closer to expiry. That's true.

Also, consider your own statements. You don't understand them. If what you're saying is true then if all your variables are constants this means that theta must change relative to your inputs so theta must at some point be subjected to the price because calculus is used fundamentally here to measure an artificial trajectory (those constants are the tracing lines) and theta by definition is just the inverse of the trajectory.

I mean you can read this anywhere but I just find it interesting that you seem to "know" theta at level 1 but not actually understand what it is for. It's basically rote memory for you; you clearly don't understand "why", and can just recite "what".

Regardless. You can have the last word. It isn't interesting listening to someone who agrees with you but is too low level to realize it.
Sure!
Imagine not having a flair
you're an r/politics brainlet. that explains this whole convo, lmao.
MRNA 2022 $50p are easy money. June 2021 if you want to get more aggressive.
March was a once in a life time opportunity if you played it right

I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see anything like that again for at least 50 years

Same with a company like Tesla

I sold but I'll be back
There are plenty of funds that track the S&P and have to match the ratios of stocks in the S&P. Therefore if SPX adds 1% Tesla then all the other funds that track have to as well. Tracking volume at close it looked as if they still had about 60 million shares that didn't fill.  Could even be more.
I knew that RH had a glitch when it showed me that at 4AM December 10th there was $51K in my account (I didn't put it there) but by 9AM there was only $13K (actual amount) üòÇ. I did close the day up $10K though so ü§∑ 

Where did the $51K come from, RH? ü§î
Did you watch the close?

That shit was manipulated as fuck.

There was one big block of about 1.5m shares that flashed for a fraction of a second at $695 and then ALL the shares that went to the index funds were tagged at $695.

The way it works is that the index funds buy the shares at the market closing price. That's the order they give to their brokers and consequently to the exchanges. Professional investors can put an order at any time to buy shares at whatever is the closing price.

30mins before close the exchange starts the auction for the closing price. Finally 10 minutes before the close the exchange feeds all the information on the buy/sell imbalances to traders and the algos kick in.

Look at exactly 10mins before close to see how the price changed instantly from about -2% to +whatever, if you check you will see its at the exact cut off algos kick in. Then the last 10mins there is a frenzy of traders matching orders.

The funds, as I mentioned, buy all their shares at closing price. Some traders who I imagine had mopped up shares in the run up, manipulated the auction for the closing price at $695. That price was literally just for split second, one big order, that set the closing price. Then the shares that went to the funds (that 60 million or whatever it was at $695) were recorded at $695 as well. There was no actual trade at that price besides that split second, but anything that was moved over to them had to carry the $695

Then immediately after hours the price dropped to $680.

Someone who checks the closing price now will think the price dropped after hours.. But it's artificial. What you have is all the traders buying low and screwing the funds at $695 sell price, then dumping everything that was left over after hours to active funds who bench against the index.

By the way, all the buying is done. Volume today was over 200m. All passive funds have finished their buys, maybe some small trickle on Monday. I expect Monday the price will be down because there is noone left to buy and a lot of inv. banks will dump whatever they couldn't pass over to funds.
Ah great now we die in an ice age thanks China
Im a noob and can't afford 100s but so far I've done great with 8 shares of tesla and a few others. Would love to look into any suggestions you have

You can code a bunch of stuff and run the script from your computer. Probably spend a few hours being frustrated.

Or you can just visit the [WSB Sentiment](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment) site and with the time you saved maybe have a sweet make out sesh with your cousin.

I think they are just jealous that retail traders are making more money.Tesla would never go up that much just with retail trades
The analysis he tweeted of WHY Tesla will fall was a great read...
I‚Äôve never seen that one
You‚Äôd assume they would though or else theres no real point of going to the to the rouble of making your own search engine.
I didn‚Äôt realize there was more to reddit?

Well the good news is it‚Äôs an artificially weak state. Usually covid exacerbates underlying issues like a naturally depressed immune system or heart conditions. Something ‚Äúinorganic‚Äù like a surgery probably makes you appear weaker and doesn‚Äôt feel great but it‚Äôs not like a fundamental underlying problem with your body.
yeah - not familiar with the reddit api, but they do look like they should be privy
