The stimmy bill that’s getting revealed tomorrow will be immediately met with ‘that’s too much’ and ‘that’s not enough’
TL0.F
I think it was a meme stock last year and only now back on everyone's radar.

This thing wasn't even being mentioned here a few weeks ago. I literally opened up these threads and did a keyword search and there were zero mentions. It will certainly dip hard at open but the real meme-ing could start once the dust settles in a week or two.

Out of all the meme stocks PLTR is the only one that is undervalued and has a lot of room to grow

Haha right. If it went IPO, it could be more than SNOW.
Fuck stocks. The dude needs a financial advisor or to not be playing this game. He’s talking about blowing $4k a week because he can’t handle numbers going down. You think he won’t dump stocks after a red day or two either?

Definitely thinking about it. Could also afford a better lifestyle now. I literally picked up everything and left when covid started, originally planning to be gone for only 2 weeks or so. If you would have asked me the day before if I would be moving the next day, I would have thought that was impossible.
Busted!
It's not quite balanced, but the world is certainly better with Google as bad as that sounds.

Obviously this is gonna work, only boomers are the ones who are afraid of psychedelics, it really makes you a better person and really makes you face your problems, they really changed my life for better. I'm investing not beacuse of making money but to really help people and to change the perspective of people in psychedelics. This is a non profit trade if it makes money good if not then too bad still worth it.
If you are buying calls, you are unamerican.

I'm getting a vibe that there are feelings that TSLA is overpriced, and may get "corrected". Bloomberg had an article stating the big banks dont agree on what target to set for it.

It's basically mutually assured destruction. When google starts locking down their APIs, everyone else does in response and Google starts sucking ass. Google's gambit is that their infrastructure and size can monetize much better than people who use their API can.

Godspeed my friend. Hopefully it gets moving sooner than later.
Wut. ToS has warrants? Fml.. now I have to figure out how and where.
I hope QS keeps mooning this week after the Friday correction.
If you are counting on evictions moratoriums, extended unemployment benefits expiring by the end of the year and the market taking a dump.  Then forget about it and push those put contracts out.

At this point the only thing that might rattle markets is some sort of war.

**Until then SPY 420c 4/20**
Bears are completely right, tesla stock price too high, but dont forget the retard indicator.  People that think Tesla will consume the entire US gdp and will rocket us to the n'th dimension in a hivemind nueralink orgy-fest are taking out payday loans to buy tesla right now

Just got a tankless hot water heater installed in the basement of my 110 year old house. What a nightmare. For anyone thinking about it: Do your research before making the switch from a tank. Where’s the condensation drain going to go? How are we running electrical to it? Do we need a permit for this work? If your licensed plumber tells you he’s done this a hundred times and not to worry, you’re ass crack is going to end up like mine, spending the next 5 weekends redoing his work
No one talking ab FDX in here makes me hyped for my calls.

Is zoom going to survive tomorrow?
2x leverage is the stock allocation that produces the highest compound return as it matches the optimal historical Kelly bet. If you allow leverage to rise significantly past 2x, you're implicitly saying you think the market is much more attractive than usual. Maybe you can, but I definitely don't know how to time markets like that. Some times markets are very expensive, yet they just keep going up (and vice-versa). You need to be very confident that the equity premium has gone up tremendously to warrant 3.3x or even 4x leverage. 

Not selling when losses mount and leverage rises well past your optimal level just to "avoid selling low" is a form of Martingale strategy. It is how people blow up accounts. It is a failure of risk management. Yes, I could handle a 37% drawdown without having to sell. But just because I COULD doesn't mean I SHOULD. I want to make money and compound it the fastest. And that means abiding by the Kelly criterion regardless of whatever gains/losses/cost basis/emotions I have.
They’re proposing a new stimmy tomorrow 👀

Lies. Bulls on America puts on England
Assuming u got in at less than $10 you still made money. Premium plus the gains from the shares. And even if they do get assigned just sell puts at a low enough price.

Now if it falls below u get ur shares back plus the premium if it doesnt ur getting free money. 

Rinse and repeat

Well no, if you’ve taken a loss you should almost never sell right at open.  But it usually doesn’t take more than a few minutes to know whether or not it’s going to trend down or if you’ll see some recovery.  

Also, I’ve learned the hard way that only fools hold volatile options with a short expiration overnight. Buy those FDs at open, sell them at close.

Once the initial crush takes place, theta gang usually buys to close the position. 

Being short Vega means that you’re banking the most while the high amount of IV that was priced into an options is being absolutely shit roasted away.  

Whatever worth is left after that is usually significantly lower and is good enough to close the position for a hefty profit and move to the next one. No point in sitting around waiting for them to expire worthless for moderate extra gains when that capital could be used elsewhere.

I have always wondered...if Google were to block web scrapers and crawlers from all sources, how many companies and products would just seize up. I am sure Google can tag these crawlers and link them back to companies running them. 

What if Google just charges a little fee? After all, these are commercial products using its infrastructure, hardware and bandwidth? Since the ads are useless with these things, the basic contract is broken here.

Solid guess. I think in AH it went up to 15ish Friday.
My first options trade was AAPL calls right before the election. I banked in the fact that regardless who wins, the market would probably go up. Trump: better for the big companies. Biden: increased public happiness. I bought my calls, sat for 5 days, lost a lot of sleep, and then one day I wake up to see it 3x my basis and I sold instantly. It was at that moment I became a retarded gambling addict and found a home here.

My point is the room for growth is narrowing rapidly for company a company that does one thing specifically. So where do we go from here? That's all. I adjusted my portfolio to be consumer facing and not business.

So in 2018 steel prices were 828 usd per metric ton, and the share price was 38$ at peak. Fast forward 1 year steel is 603 usd/mt, and the share price dropped to around 20. 

Assuming that steel prices surpass 828 usd/mt, does this mean we are going to see 35-40+? Or are there underlying factors which might not make it moon? it looks like a good play to me but at the same time i dont know too much about the steel market.

I really appreciate this DD. I've been monitoring the steel play as well. $X and $CLF have been strong over the last month, and Steel Dynamics is about to take off.

I assumed that steel *processors* like Worthington Industries would be hurt from this development, given that their inputs will now be more costly... but you said that there is more demand for their finished products. 

I haven't made a commodities play before, but it sounds like I should stick to *producers* for the greatest upside.

I think the “gaming cafe” thing would be a great move for them just in terms of adding more sources of revenue, and giving them a niche to separate them from other online retailers. They could host tournaments and take a rake of the buy ins, they could add more trading card sales (magic, Pokémon, yugioh, etc), could charge people $X to be able to play whatever you want in store that day, which would allow customers to try out a game before buying, or just kill some time like you would at an arcade. 

Now, in order for them to do that they still need to close down a lot of locations (like they are planning on doing), and open some locations with more space in them. Cause right now most of their stores are tiny and shitty and have no room to do any sort of events beyond midnight releases of a new game.

Industries (such as automotive, but many others) are moving toward new designs with drastically smaller part counts. Like, thousands fewer parts. You need 3D printing to do that. Metal 3D printing at a sufficient quality level is not easy. The barrier to entry is high. DM has already done the hard work. Now it's time to reap the rewards of the next industrial revolution.

Well, not 90%, but I realized that Carnival Cruise is probably too big to fail in the aftermath of the pandemic. And unlike watching movies in movie theatre chains, flying for business trips, and buying shit in physical chain stores, I fully believe the demand for taking cruise vacations will return to nearly full pre-pandemic capacity.
Id pick SM Energy is also a good one.  Made the mistake of selling earlier only for it to just an additional 40%.

Cons:  
- Catalyst: possible sports cancellation (NBA, March Madness), but at this point we look good
- Competiton (like FanDuel) getting more traction and press, but DonkeyKong is still the boss over these diddys

Pro’s:
- NY may be about to legalize. This would be Huge. Shares have already spiked on rumors, but were batted down last week with the market wide pullback. 
- Hopeful expansion in other markets including Canada and additional US states that have had reduced economies due to Covid
- Chart looks very very good for an upswing. 

Shares or calls 1-2 months out should be a good bet. Pun intended. 

Good luck

The Moderna vaccine does cause you to make the spike protein, but it doesn't make any complete, functional spike protein integrate into cell membranes. If that happened then a large proportion of people in the trials would have suffered massive and probably life-threatening autoinflammatory reactions. Given that this didn't happen...

In reality the spike proteins are synthesized, degraded into smaller peptides (thus losing any function) within the same cell that it was synthesized, and then those fragments are presented for interaction with immune cells that subsequently develop antibodies.

By the way, for all you whiny cry-baby TA screamers out  there jamming goji berries and golden crosses up your ass complaining that this sub doesn't take you seriously, this is why.

This is what good TA looks like. Scratch that. This is actual TA.

Not tea leaves. It's examining charts with statistical deviance and probabilities and plays based on those metrics. Not buying Palantir because gram-gram's flopsweat plonked on your toast this morning in the shape of it's logo so you yoloed her pension in the basement 10 minutes later.

Personally, I feel the stock has been flooded with Chamath's cult millennial following on Twitter and will take a while to flush out the noise on this one. Great long-term play in my opinion.

Great post. Are you actually making bullish trades on these stocks yourself tomorrow, or did you just analyze the charts? 

Also, I've been watching some of your youtube vids - right now, i'm on the in depth TA and indicators one. Very educational! I hope to add some of these trades tomorrow. I was still planning to enter SILV and WDAY as well. Really appreciate all the free analysis.

2.2x seems to be about 9% drawdown. Why not let leverage rise as as much possible to allow your portfolio to recover and start selling only when you get closer to getting margin called to avoid selling low?

With a maintenance margin requirement of 30% you can let leverage go up to 3.3x or 4.0x for 25% maintenance margin. That would be around 28-33% drawdown from 2x.
Same boat as you with 1X640C.  Very down.

It's good to be optimistic and positive but sometimes things just suck and you have to acknowledge that. Pain and loss and sadness are all a part of life and should be accepted for what they are. Otherwise you're just going to end up beating yourself up if you can't force yourself to be positive all the time when things are shitty. Just shrug to yourself and say "today sucks, tomorrow will be better" and move on.

Wow you’re a smart man
Positive mental attitude is that philosophy which asserts that having an optimistic disposition in every situation in one's life attracts positive changes and increases achievement. Adherents employ a state of mind that continues to seek, find and execute ways to win, or find a desirable outcome, regardless of the circumstances. This concept is the opposite of negativity, defeatism and hopelessness. Optimism and hope are vital to the development of PMA.

Only if I get to go first
Fantastic story, hopefully my RPRX puts print tomorrow as they should very nicely, I'll be adding this to my portfolio. 

I've one question. If Ackman can't take profit until investors get 20% returns, the NVA was $20 if I'm not mistaken so wouldn't the current price of 26 ish be above that threshold and he is able to take a profit? Maybe it's the principle that matters more than the fact that it's already above the 20%
Time to sell, my dude

GE 3/19/21. I was in at 10C a while ago and with 10 contracts made $800 over a couple of weeks or so. I sold them since Im dumb but if I held would’ve been more. They are currently sitting at 11 something and I’ve jumped back but this time for a $12 call. Also their price target has been bumped up by a few analysts from 12-14 or so.
Jump in for the 12C because they are down at 11.14 right now. If anything bad happens I’m suspecting they won’t go any lower than $10
Game is fucking fun as hell and I'm having a blast but I am starting to get more crashes now, playing on PS4 pro. It really doesn't deserve all the hate it's getting.

Until you're out of those numbers ....... and then you realize you need more and don't have any to deposit.
Yea just buy ABNB and stripe when it IPOs later
Yes. Wanna buy my calls?
DBX
thats real story. theres people in here without any mental issues and should really buy stocks and not options because of indecisive or bad judgement..

thats exactly why i have aapl, nio, and tsla stocks.
Why wouldn't you just get the 50? Much more vol and most likely a tighter bid ask.

Are you saying you don’t have any gains this year to offset?

Also how are you calculating your cost basis? Add up how much premium you would pay plus the cost of the shares. That’s your cost basis.
Good
No. Has nothing to do with my position. I’m just trying to understand what you wrote - beginning with “I’m not a bear but..” and ending it with “you fucking idiots”
I don’t understand why it’s so cheap. It’s like $0.35 for $35 calls in March
Pumping, treating and piping the water to where it is needed seems like that is an added value. Why the hate on that? Those three things could be the whole cost and the actual water is free if that makes you feel better.

Is tesla opening green tmr?
Its probably not Stripe and not cause the CEO said it wasn’t but because he said ANYTHING about it.  These guys lips are tighter than a nuns cunt on deals like this so he would never respond to some random tweet and risk the SEC up his ass if he were in any type of talk.
Many people had too high expectation which is why they’re so angry about it. It’s not that the game is bad, it’s that it isn’t revolutionary at all. It just feels like a dying light reskin gameplay wise. Also they cut corners, non combat AI is pure garbage, cars don’t even drive they just kinda glide on rails, NPCs just kinda walk in a straight line.

Also the fact that ARK has a dedicated 3D printing ETF (PRINT) should clue you in to something going on here ...

Josh Allen is incredible against the blitz
Agree. I think OP is giving bad advice to get people to dump or buy puts that will lose a lot of value from the pre-merger run up. This still has a lot of room to go up when QS can get to 70+ on vaporware, how far can this go for a company that actually has a good product the EV drivers use on regular basis? It's cheap at $37 right now.

Before we left we all specifically said to get 40c 12/31 before we took off. Your wifes boyfriend cant do it for you we already took off. Fine we'll go back Shitron Command will just make some stupid shit up to make a dip so theres some Tendies for you retards.

PLTR Flight Log 12/4: Alright you retards, any Autists that didn't get calls will go fuck themselves and watch their wifes get fucked by her boyfriend. We're taking off and no turning back. We might slow down a bit so we can use our Wendys paycheck to buy more space Tendies but thats fucking it.

3d printing isn't where it needs to be for this to blow up, yet. We're still a good time period away from anything great happening in 3d printing.

Until 3d printing can break the hurdle of mass production and by mass production I mean tens of thousands of parts being made in a day with great accuracy, it will still be a developing technology.

For the people who follow blindly: just know this is OP’s complete speculation. Absolutely could be and most likely is wrong about who they’ll merge with. Spacs are impossible (nearly) to predict accurately. Additionally, you could be sitting in the stock for months before anything actually happens, therefore, there is opportunity cost. 

With that being said, grabbing a couple hundred shares when I exit my big fuckin tendies position.

Because the other guys point was he couldn't sustain these returns because if he could Quants would be doing it, but why would they do it if the actual return in 11 months is 70 thousand dollars? That doesn't even pay for the nerd they got to analyze it, and there is no guarantee that this would work all the way to a million dollars, or a billion dollars.

Correct. And depending how fast and violent a dip is will determine how quickly I take a loss or ride a while for a correction. Don’t fall in love with a play and you won’t blow up your account. If it looks like it’s going real bad get out. I’m usually around 30% loss I will get out. If already in profit can be a percentage of what you have made say 30% drop in profit. If your still bullish you can buy back in after it settles at a discount.
Easily solution for that; buy TSLA and PLTR calls at open and brag here about how smert you are.
Yes!!! Exactly.
One side it seems like we are about to moon with the vaccine news shipping out

On the other side I have a bad feeling they sell the market off at open after it gaps up?

Selling covered calls when the meme is trending is very bad.  This guy buying PLTR shares is pretty good if hes looking 2-3 years out since the shares will probably be at least 100% gains by then.
Yep, everyone making jokes about it and talking about buying puts. I think the company will have a monster run over the next two years, and I never ever say that about any IPO. I’m always very anti-IPO investing. But we shall see. :)

So I’ll talk about one of the plays I’m in that has had action recently because it’s a good example of a hidden gem ex SPAC. I am not at all recommending you invest in this one in particular. I don’t want any part in a WSB pump n dump. Digital Media Solutions was one I had been looking at since they started trading. Like most do, it took a nosedive and I averaged down with the warrants because I went through their SEC filings and liked what I saw. Recently they got on the radar because an article was written about them on yahoo finance. Then it brought attention that raised warrants. This is a pretty good example of what I’m searching for.

Not too much to worry about since there's a $10 floor but we could be waiting for a while. There's a reason why it's still relatively cheap when this could be one of the biggest SPAC mergers. Either big money is accumulating or they're putting their money elsewhere for now until there's a better idea of when a merger could happen.

There's some solid DD on NVAX here by a guying with a phd/industry experience, check it out. 

Short answer though is that due to supply constraints no single producer (or all of them combined) will be able to handle the demand. So yes it isn't the first, but it will still sell a huge amount of vaccines. Then with a market cap of less than 1/20th of PFE you better believe it'll make gains.

Good thing SF is filled with 🌈🐻
Can someone explain to me the reasoning on PLTR? I like the stock and get riding the wave, but people are saying they got their life savings invested in it expecting it to go to 100 a share or something. It is valued at 45% of IBM's valuation despite doing 1/77th the revenue. If the stock were to go to 100 a share it would be valued at much more than IBM.

Well, at least for a lot of the other stocks / tech companies, you can argue there aren't good comps or the company has no financials, so we can value it whatever we want

Literally, Blackstone and CVC just bought Paysafe out in 2017 for $4B USD. In 3 years, they grew revenue from $1.1B to $1.3B. And now, it is being taken public again via a SPAC for $9B, and you all think the stock should double from where it is ($15 implying $12B EV) to a $24B EV company. The only people you're enriching is the private equity firms, which are laughing at the fact that you're all just printing money for them since they haven't done much of anything with Paysafe.

In my area (SF Bay Area), a large majority of the L3 chargers are EVGo & Voltas, Chargepoint's main customer is government & businesses. I'm pretty sure the business sector has completely stopped buying L2 chargers for offices with everything going on, over 50% of remote employees prefer working remotely permanently. 

By the way, when you're looking at L3 chargers on the ChargePoint app, they're displaying EVGo Chargers & Voltas and other network chargers. Not sure how they're making money on those however.

ChargePoint will win the contracts like they currently do. Chargepoint sells the charging infrastructure and their software platform as a service. They take a small cut of the charging fee. They don't make a lot from selling electricity. Most of the money is from the selling the equipment itself. The other charging stations are privately owned and don't sell charging stations. They depend on people to use their stations to make money. If no one uses their station, they don't make money. Meanwhile Chargepoint makes money regardless if people use the stations and more money if people actually charge there. Chargepoint doesn't have any major risk while the other companies do. 

The government contracts will most likely be given to local governments with a mandate to install additional charging stations. Many cities already bought a lot of L2 chargers from Chargepoint. They are already in the Chargepoint "ecosystem". When they need to install more chargers, they'll just call up Chargepoint because that's easiest for them. I've charged at plenty of Chargepoint DCFC for free sponsored by the city. Check the Chargepoint app or Plugshare to find them. You can filter by free/paid and plug type (DC Fast - Combo).

If you sell a covered call, you are bullish, but if it goes your direction too quickly you can get burned when you can't roll for a credit.  Same thing can happen to the synthetic.  You need to sell more extrinsic than you buy and pay no more than 75% the width of the strikes if you want to ensure you make money when you get called.

Right, emulators do exist too. Folks either spend money on computer hardware or consoles. But it’s still spending money. Overall, it’s cheaper to buy a console than it is to build an equivalent PC. GameStop does sell gaming computers and I think they’d be smart to lean into that segment harder.

The downside is $20 with no merger, or bailing if you think it’s a shit merger. Shares are pretty safe. I’ve got 5 of the $20C and 5 of the $25C, and 500 shares around $22.50. Probably going to add more to it if there’s a pullback.

Annual meeting isn't until June. Stockholders don't get much of a say in anything until then. I doubt RC is going to sit, wait patiently, and play by house rules. 4Q earnings numbers may be released in January. I would expect a move to become evident in Jan-Feb timeframe. 

The approval to dilute shares is only approved. It hasn't happened. The stock tanking +20% is far more than any dilution by new shares. This was Sherman taking stockholders hostage to defend against RC. I believe he has chosen poorly. RC holds the initiative and will act according to his own schedule. He isn't reactive. He will choose the timing and place of the next battle. 

In the meantime, I see Sherman shivering in antici-...

Just so every one is clear not all funds that track the SP 500 have to balance at once.  The funds track the index it doesnt dictate they have to do it at same time.

The problem here is - Paysafe actually has financials and has plenty of publicly traded comps. All of the public comps trade for 5-7x LTM revenue and 20 - 25x LTM EBITDA. At the current price of \~$15, the EV is already $12B. That implies a 2020E revenue multiple of \~9x and 2020E EBITDA multiple of 29x. It just seems impossible for the stock price to double from here and maintain any semblance of rationale valuations
Tesla bro Tesla.

I chose weeding cause I felt that even if the stock goes to the moon soon my capital wouldn’t be enough for any srs gains so I just let it go to party. i only found out about options in 2020. Now I cry everytime I see the early tsla  gains people posted. I missed a shooting star

I mean yeah.. most of success boils down to volatility/drawdown tolerance.. and IMO drawdown is not a big deal.. it's just something to reduce to make you look better as a portfolio manager, but it's really only cosmetic and only serves to scare the clients. Fuck them, better to just be a black box and not show them jack shit.. fuck em, tell them "YOU WANNA FUCKING MAKE MONEY? GIVE ME YOUR MONEY AND DON"T FUCKING CALL ME FOR 1 YEAR!!"

Could just use VT, sure. I prefer a portfolio with value/quality/momentum to increase returns past just the market.
It's not very logical to lend money with bonds when you're also borrowing it. The difference in returns between BND and my borrowing cost is too small to matter.

Xpeng and Nio vehicles are classed as luxury automobiles and price themselves higher than Tesla. Tesla attempted a price war just this year Q2 or Q3 and gave up on it after realizing they're being seen as the Honda of EVs and it won't work. Public perception of the EVs is that Nio and Xpeng are superior. Tesla is a large well known brand name.

Couldn’t agree more man. We so often discount the time/stress it requires to maintain significant leveraged holdings, only to beat indexes by less than the additional taxes you pay on short term gains. Options will always be a part of my life but I don’t think anything more than 10-20% max is healthy

People who will sell spce tomorrow does not realise that after they sell what will they do with the cash they will again end up going into some stock and will lose money there and quit.

Not sure about that.
1. CRSP, EDIT, etc are still drug companies so their growth potential is held back by clinical trials and their market growth is limited because they can't run trials on 100 drugs at once.
2. They aren't actual owners of the relevant patents, just licensors and they can't use those patents for all possible applications
3. Science moves quickly compared to clinical trials so by the time they are making money, the hot new gene-editing technology, could be here. Note also that this doesn't necessarily have to be an entirely new technique, just e.g. a different cas enzyme not covered by the patents they have exclusive license to.

Only thing giving me anxiety is that they don’t look manipulated. So, now that democracy is safe and the Vax is shipping, is JPow taking his foot off the accelerator? That last Fed report was not confidence-building.

Palantir is an evil company run by assholes but on the other hand if you win this bet you'll be able to move out of your parents' basement and get off of welfare so maybe let's hope you get there just this once.
I would have to pull up my trade confirmation but I show around 30% for QQQ and 52% for UPRO (March to oct). 

My entry was too early and covid ripped me a bit or it would have been more dramatic. 

Mai reason for the post was when I said I was going to make this trade most people told me “it was going to zero”...  it did not (but I was early).

I do not know. Predictions are that the dollar will reverse like gold did a few weeks back but the US has printed an awful lot this year. I don't foresee the collapse of the dollar but I really don't know shit. I'd worry more about a debt crisis when mortgage protection is lifted. I'm bearish for January-Feb but we could just pump on to 400 too.

How? From where? If the labor pool is cheaper how do rent prices sustain when a third of renters can't afford current rents. Obviously there's a ton of optimism that 30 million un/underemployed and a significant amount of people not being able to make rent or their mortgage won't have a serious impact on the market. I just can't understand it. Is there really that little demand created by the poorer half of our economy? Genuinely asking

Www.betterhelp.com
I’ll fuckin PLTR bro
Yup
You guys gotta let us know before you put in your orders so we can front run
Let me play devils advocate.

1. xbox, ps5 sold out. Yeah GME just sold 100k consoles in 1 day yesterday. GME trending towards profitability and mgmt said on Q3 CC they will be profitable in Q4.
2. GME has good value for gamers. Used games and trade ins give GME value and a competitive advantage. Physical media not as dead as wall street thinks.
3. Brand recognition is important. GameStop.com has around 100k orders per day. They also ranked #5 on all websites shoppers **intend** to make purchases on this holiday season (Ahead of BestBuy).

I guess you can look at both sides of coin and come to different conclusions. Market will decide in the end.
This is the way

But we both know they wouldn't have been bailed out.

Government bailouts and too big to fail mentality have made these companies lazy and bloated. They're no longer the benchmark for booming business.

Compare that to Tesla's innovation in automated production. And the emerging market they target. 

Considering the fact their cars are closer to computers they have extra sources of revenue in the form of purchasable software . They're not a comparable

the most you can lose, if buy $500 call, is $500.
that's the first thing to think about.

you could possibly lose less than $500, if you get out of a wrong move quickly.

you might win your first one but not many more unless you have edge/luck(strikeover)

leverage, 1 call controlls 100 shares.

calls come in every price range but $500 each is mid range for some

Ahhh taking the other side of the trade. You would be better off taking the other side of QQQ VGT or SPY. 

There will be a rotation out of tech and spy into small caps and small cap value - that is why dumped UPRO for TNA. 

A second catalyst is Democrats and economic recovery favor small businesses (TNA). 

Small caps have started to out perform SPY finally  (compare Russell 2000 to sp500 recently).

I see 3 of them on the chargepoint app in the north SF bay area, and each one only has 1 level 3 charging head.

Over 50% of remote employees prefer working from home permanently, I don't believe this has been factored into their revenue projections. Their growth is completely stagnating right now.

Good question. I don't own a Tesla either. With any modern product, there is always a checkbox 'Can we use the data to improve your experience, etc?'
I guess in the end, it's the data and the technology used to process it (usually some sort of AI) that makes a difference. If the product is improving then the desired outcome is achieved. As to the value of the data, only the manufacturer would know as they are the ones using it.

Pulling theta by buying 100 GHIV shares and selling the 17.50 1/15/21 call brings your risk to 0(assuming bottom is 9.70), and maximized your gains at 60%ish. If I could find this kind of trade monthly I would do it 10/10 times.

No more magazines. They make sexual wellness and shit for stores + acquired Yandy which is e-commerce similar to Adam and Eve, so they can use the word omni-channel to get big investors. 

With the brand-name they can take over the whole sex industry. They have enough capital and equivalents to buy out another segment of the sex industry.. Only fans perhaps? That would be my guess for their next step in growth. 

Plus the current owners know more than anyone how the company's trajectory is shaping out and the they showed they're confident in the combined company bc they had the option to either get cash or stonks and they rolled all their equity into the new company. These dudes get bunny blowjobs DAILY they aren't cursed with the burden of making decisions on a full sack, which as we all know leads to bad decision making, so if they believe in this company growing more than the current valuation + time equity and faster than inflation, then you better believe in it too.
That's CRSP, not CRSR.

Buy calls at the top and puts at the bottom. The WSB way.
If your winners are call options, then no it is not better to add to your winners, unless the dte is 3+ months away. Anything that is monthly contracts or shorter will be highly volatile and you can literally be +150% one day (of course this becomes the day you average up) to +35% the next day, ultimately putting you at a negative overall or something. 

If you’re hitting 133% or more on a call, just sell it and move on to a new ticker. If you’re only up 60% or something, let that ride and do not add to it. Basically just fire your shot with enough free capital to average down, if needed. If you profit the first day, sell it and move on.

Because I spent 3 months (Sep-Nov) “playing it safe” by diversifying and all I did was move sideways and follow the market (though I did play around with options here are there). So I just decided to gamble it all on TSLA and I made $70k in 11 days.
And now I use this video to justify my addiction: https://youtu.be/DUG_z7LUDSA
I just turned 19, finished my first semester of college, and have a steady source of income (started my own business with my brothers). I recovered -100k of losses twice in a matter of 3 weeks and I’m still up from when I started playing this incredibly risky. Not much to lose (no kids or debt, steady income, only in college, family doing okay financially). Upside outweighs downside.

Ya, this one is way too good for how low the price is. An actual profitable SPAC $(142 mil profit in 2019). With $1b in revenue and $100b in transactions. Let that sink in.. $100 billion transferred through their system last year.

If the stock opens down like 10 to 15% I'll probably buy like $500 of those calls.  Over the next hour if the stock then tics up a few percentage points I'll cash out like $200 of profit.    


If the stock continues to tic down another 5% (or whatever) I'll buy in another $500 of calls.  Around this point it \*should\* be near the bottom so my 2nd buy in probably won't lose a lot of money.  If the stock bounces up a few percentage points I'll probably exit the trade even or up a few hundred.

If no bounce I probably lose like 500 bucks.
Yes.

 Probably not. IV was cheap as fuck on Friday. Guess we will see where it’s at on Monday. I do think it’s worth 40-45 a share though, so give it 6 months and it should be there
This is why you should have an investing plan
I updated my post.
fuck that piece of shit
You lack on keeping up with the news and trends. Roblox IPO was delayed till next year. New IPOs don't allow option trading. Second off paper hands if you're going to make a investment either stick with it or gtfo options. Go back to working at taco bell and quit thinking you're the next wolf of wall street.

I keep feeling like it should drop for whatever reason, but then if people cash out wtf are they going to do with the money? Buy treasuries?? Lmao

Good point, trying to find a day when the FMOC meeting is but not seeing anything, got a date?
If snow could crash 15% tomorrow with the first round of lockups ending that would be lit
Thanks sir- Hope we're right about this.
It’s going to run this week!!
correct, warrants are currently trading at an extremely high premium and will almost certainly take a huge hit in value when the merger happens and the tontine warrants that are attached to the common shares are sent out
Boner spread

yeezy there big fella
There's not really a great place for this, but I finally got around to tearing into the CRSR DD that was being posted in the thread yesterday, and it's a complete shitshow of zero financial literacy and questionable analysis.

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kbwywx/corsair_gaming_crsr_due_diligence_dd_semilong_post/

Basically it's 3 points:

1. Rosy PR speak - don't give a shit

2. Using comparative % to project the future - he highlights how amazing the "Net Income: +2293.5% !!!!" is, but this is not very surprising at all for a recently profitable company (1.5M to 36M). A very good growth, but if you project it forward on those numbers, they will surpass Amazon's net income in 2 years. Don't think I need to explain further why recently profitable companies have distorted growth rates.

3. CRSR is growing faster than LOGI - it isn't. It's really hard to see where this came from, but it isn't by any plausible metric. Anyone with financial literacy would have to use revenues as the main indicator for growth, and LOGI not only grew their revenues by a larger % this year (75% compared to 61%), they also grew their revenue by more than 300% the revenue growth of CRSR and 17% more than CRSR's total revenue.

Take a class if you can, so you don't just clap at big numbers being posted. CRSR is a good buy at the right price, but don't think it's going to be worth $120 in a year because someone on /r/investing projects it being bigger than Amazon in the next 5 years.

Futures looking RICH, and why the hell shouldn't they?  It's not like there is a government shutdown in the hands of Nacy P and Mitch M. What. The Fuck. I guess I guessed wrong on puts.  Good thing I dont have any real skin in the game since I cashed out my initial investment a while ago.  I was just hoping to have more to play with this week.  Between my puts worthless and MOTHER FUCKING SPCE ship not doing SHIT I guess I'll be sitting there twiddling my thumbs trying to figure out how not to GAMBLE the rest away.

Right away.  I thought about waiting to see if there is going to be a big dip but with the news out late I think there will be a lot  more momentum taking pretty high on  Monday so when it does dip it may be quite a bit higher than what it's at now.    We shall see.

Sometimes the Gods smile upon you my friends. Sometimes you are just reading WSB and hoping you'll get another dose of confirmation bias and you'll wake up next morning being a millionaire and not down 5% pre-market.

But then there are times like these, where the comment you read is so innocuous and yet so fucking hilarious, that you spit out your beer. Kudos.

U have spent more time typing a response in order to not answer than just answering the damn question.   Why can you not just answer? Fuck man.
My first question is do you think it’s a good company?  If yes what’s stopping you. If no, what’s stopping you?  

If you’re in this to buy weekly calls in case it gains 15-20% that’s just a coin flip so flip a coin. I’m not saying you’re wrong for your approach or anything but acknowledge a gamble for what it is.   If you think in terms of months, buy options further into the future. 

I digress. This is a casino so yolo that shit for as far OTM as you can expiry this week. God speed retard!

‘A slow sort of country!’ said the Queen. ‘Now, *here*, you see, it takes all the running *you* can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!’

Well it’s not overly complicated:

1. Res dotted channel is the ‘point of control’ or the highest nods of volume. It acts as a point of gravitation. 
2. Dotted white lines is where 70% of volume happens and act somewhat as a large scale ‘best value’ and ‘resistance. 
3. Solid white are supports / resistance. 
4. Gold lines are trends.

Curious where you got all this info about the us, is this from William Blum?
I bought a house during a frenzy 2 years ago, my house was 280 k in 2015 and I paid 460. We had our offer accepted the morning it was listed.  In a few months once a few hundred more desperate buyers have to pull the same tactics then that will be the new norm.  Buyers only pull that move after they have been shafted a few times on previous homes.  My house is assessed at 500k now 2 years later.  Just buy what you want and can afford and don’t worry about the market unless you are a flipper
Give it a little more time maybe it will get a boost from Christmas but get out at least 4 weeks before expiration.  Sooner if you find a different opportunity that looks really good.  Don't let loss aversion make you miss me opportunities.  I let baba fuck me the last month when I should have eaten the losses and played different stocks.  Crsr will probably only go up with the next earnings report whenever that is
They are growing, gotta spend money to make money. Nio is gonna be huge in the long run.

Derivatives all expire and reset basically. Creates a lot of volatility, allegedly, though last time it wasn’t particularly volatile. People here like it because they think it’s easy money or they’re very scared of it because they think dump incoming. In reality, market is already pretty volatile, quad witching hasn’t really been that crazy.

How many dogs have yall killed tho? Lol
if you are thinking about jumping into PLTR for this or next week dont get greedy and buy the 40s. jump into the 35s. i think we crack ATH of 33 and settle around mid 30s before the move to 40 EOY.

The reason the SPAC trades below $10 is because the unit still trades. The value of the SPAC shares are a function of Stock price + fraction of warrant issued = UNIT PRICE. 

Example: Unit = 1 share of stock + 1/3 warrant 

Unit currently trading 10.50

If the unit is trading 10.50 then common is worth $10 and full warrant should trade 1.50 otherwise you get some arbitrage. Say the unit is 10.50 but the full warrant is trading 1.80 then the common should trade 9.90 even though the trust value could be over $10. 

Math for reference 

Unit 10.50 - fraction of warrant $0.60 = 9.90 

Warrant derived as $1.80/3

Yeah I'm aware of the Arizona plant. But by the time it is actually done, the landscape will likely have changed. If you look at my positions I've been at it a while, I just haven't gotten around to writing up a solid DD.
I mean, I’ve done soo much DD on them and there isn’t one bad thing about them. It’s an estimated $35 trillion industry. And they’re set to grow into the next PayPal. Also more profitable per dollar than PayPal and almost the size of square. Gonna be fucking HUGE!

Goog was already announced. Amazon has been on radar, it’s just more complicated. 

Amazon is unquestionably working internally to come up with a deal so they don’t have the govt deciding how to change their business. Fed and state govt’s have been targeting amazon. It’s going to happen.
I'd imagine there would be less volume on the day trades which would eventually push the price up.

Fair point. But again, ASML is not the focus here.
Look, I already told you. "You're not wrong", you're just an asshole for it. 


Relish in the fact that you get to be right about your observation in how unfair the system is, but understand that you're also an absolute prick for taking it out on the victims of that system even further. Those waiters get paid less than minimum wage due to different minimum wage laws, and if they go to their employers to make up the missing tips because nobody was tipping them that day, they often either get fired or put on quiet shifts with even less potential for tip money. 


Sure, again, I guess it's not your problem. But that makes you both right AND an asshole. Enjoy it - you get to be technically correct, which is often all that matters for people who lack empathy and compassion. They don't care about other people while simultaneously acting morally superior. 


Enjoy not tipping and being smug about being "correct." Guaranteed those servers will remember you and you'll never get good service at those restaurants ever again.

Uhh they probably can't fly again even if they wanted and if they had permits. Getting anything ready for launch is super complicated and it's not so easy as fueling your car. 

When you are SpaceX launching twice in a week that's incredible. That is a huge competitive advantage.

Ok seems like you’re looking at their summary for non gaap which is adjusted for the stock based compensation. Up to you if you want to look at it that way but if you don’t understand how that differs from the gaap summary you should investigate the difference more. https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx

Fat chance. They’ve pretty much committed to not raising rates until 2023, they don’t give a fuck about inflation anymore (//are hoping that all the poor people losing their jobs will be deflationary enough to offset any CPI inflation)
If you invest in SPACs with nobodies backing it you're taking the same risk as investing in penny stocks. 

Besides that if those meme SPACs decide to moon 100% for no reason you might as well try to get 10%-50% depending on risk aversion.

That leads to quite a few concerning issues. While I've driven a Model S, I don't own one. From what you're saying I gather there's a clause where Tesla says "All your data is belong to us." and that real time data is gathered via BTB IOT or something.

Is the data gathered by Tesla worth more than or equivalent to the cars they're selling?
Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.

Some of these meme stocks are legit companies no doubt. I mean PRPL is definitely printing $$$ during the pandemic. TSLA is insanely overvalued but I wouldn't bet against them breaking in and creating unforseen markets in the next decade or two. Even this PLTR bullshit pump is based on legit (and possibly destructive) potential. But people love the hype, not the fundamentals.

Crazy to think that if I just held my 8 shares of TSLA that I bought and sold at around $900 pre-split and pre-COVID, I would have made more money while not even doing anything but just sitting on shares.
Agreed.  Solid through end of January and then the dump.

They made a paper loss as they had lots of employee compensation(which was in stock options, so it’s kinda a non-cash expense).

So, they actually made accounting loss. But if you don't count that numerical expense(most of it is one time expense for going public) then they made a profit.

You know, I always had a deep suspicion that intel bulls are just lonely cucks who fall for marketing bullshit and you fit the bill.

1. No ass-wipe. Intel can't make 7nm, they can't make 10 nm. They are currently releasing a CPU on 14nm, a 6 year old process because they can't actually fulfill orders otherwise. It is that bad.
2. No way. We will see an initial expansion as more stuff moves online due to COVID but that will settle after a year. Literally no one is expecting this to go on forever.
3. If you think P/E is a good measure of a stock you are going to be mighty surprised come earnings time for intel buddy. Their P/E has been low for the past two earnings and they dropped 10% each time because P/E doesn't actually matter when a business is failing at their core competencies
4. You do realize that a server CPU is just a desktop CPU but bigger right? It makes no sense that Intel will some how do great in the data center. AMD is gaining now in the data center: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-28/amd-gives-bullish-forecast-boosted-by-server-processor-sales](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-28/amd-gives-bullish-forecast-boosted-by-server-processor-sales)

And what the fuck are you talking about stimulus checks here for? I have almost 25k on TSM. I make so much I didn't even get a check. I posted my positions. Why don't you man up, put your dick on the chopping block, and post yours.

Objectively, 6ix9ine’s lyrics are a work of genius. While most may pass up his spoken word poetry song “TATI” as another hard-beat mumble rap song, I can appreciate it for its true efforts. Many lyrics in the song are captivating and explore themes many of us listeners can barely understand. For example, “Back out, straight to the trap house, I blow her back out I'll pull her tracks out, got her running like it's track now Like a Smackdown, rock bottom I'ma pin her down” is really a set of lines that speak to me. I’ll let you analyze that one yourself to see if you can truly understand the intellect that is 6ix9ine’a brain. Another piece of lyrical genius is his unforgettable chorus for the same song. Rhyming words like “licky”, “blicky”, AND “flicky” takes a certain kind of talent. While some may pass off his choice of words as lazy, I am one of the few minds that can understand his true efforts and meaning into the song. 6ix9ine isn’t lazy in his writing, he is using simple rhyming and repetition to speak to the simple minded listener- people unlike me- who have trouble understanding the true meaning of his incredible music. I’d bet you still haven’t figured out that first lyrical sample I gave you; that’s okay- sometimes things are best left to the professionals.
That’s why you buy mini leaps months out instead of under 30dte, you can easily get 30% with a few good days, and can hold long enough if you’re down you’ll still eventually see 30% at some point, unless you put it in a bullshit penny stock or sumn.

Disney owns all their content, and they have 100 years of it. Netflix only owns a bit of their programming and their back catalog is obviously much, much smaller.

Yes you can! And I just try to look for calls with as low of a delta as I can and make sure I don’t sell calls that are lower than my break even, that way even if it pumps I don’t lose anything. I focus on selling weeklies and I’ll roll it out if I want to move the strike up for a higher maximum profit.

All this ARKG talk got me thinking it's too late already
Arguably the only reason you should buy options with expiries that far out (these are LEAPs) is if you intend to hold onto them for a long time and let them appreciate. Based on  AAPL's historical growth (and assuming no major change in investor's outlook on AAPL) by fall 2022 its share price should be well above your breakeven of about 182. So I would recommend holding onto them until they near expiry, unless AAPL starts underperforming to the point that it is no longer certain that it will hit 182+ by 9/22.
Jeez this makes so much sense. It’s seems like a lot of EV SPACs have such shitty fundamentals that if they tried to get listed conventionally on the NYSE they’d get eaten alive. 

IPO’ing via SPAC gives these series a-h angel investors a shot to recoup their investment by having us retarded retail investors buy-out their previously retarded investments.

Any other SPACs that you think will nosedive?

Lmfao alright man sorry I took your first statement wrong but you are just saying “PLTR GO DOWN BECAUSE HIGH MARKET CAP” even though the business fundementals of the company is great, they have very limited competition, they supply many services in almost every sector of the market, and Tiberius is already helping with vaccine distribution giving them tons of PR over the weekend.
I made ~$25k doing that (none got assigned) after the dip at end of November. But I think it’s blowing up this week so I’m not selling any

Not exactly. They had inventory at their distribution centers. To fight online bots, they made it so store employees could place orders for those in store and announced it last minute. People flocked to stores and got pissed. 

Problem is someone figured out a backdoor way to use the internal link and the bot boys cooked those systems.

GameStop apparently can't tell which orders were placed in store and which were with the backdoor link.

Rumor is they are now canceling all of the orders.

So now they've just pissed off all the ps5 fanboys and scalpers and have ps5s in a warehouse somewhere that the are too retarded to figure out how to sell. Puts on GME.

Not a priority though the wife begs to differ
covid means more people indoors, and a heavier demand for at-home entertainment

it also means more store closures. it was noted in the ER that this has a strong effect on their comparable sales, because fewer stores, fewer sales

at the same time, they've mentioned that e-commerce sales have jumped up drastically

they also mentioned that comparable store sales have gone up 16% for month november Y/Y

therefore, it's hard to say what the results will be. it can be said with a fair amount of certainty that they will have positive net income

lastly, it's impossible to know what the stock will do unless you're an insider in the industry or in the company

You're the asshole on this because you're blaming and punishing them directly for the system. They're catering to your table directly throughout your dining experience, and have to put up with your bullshit whining when somebody in the back happens to forget some small aspect of your order. And they don't know going into it that an hour later you're going to be a prick and stiff them on the tip, making all of their efforts on you a complete waste. They shouldn't have even given you half the attention they inevitably will because why the fuck should they? You're not going to tip them but the other tables will. Might as well give those people the extra effort instead of your selfish ass. 


And you're also the asshole because I can tell you're just an actual asshole, based on how you're talking. Not necessarily this specific topic, but your despicable lack of empathy and "fuck everybody but me" attitude. Your sheer level of entitlement and self-centered attitude. You're just, simply put, an asshole. Period.

For leaps like this you want to buy in slowly over time. Increasing your buys as theta eats away at them assuming the price isn't violently moving against you. The goal is to DCA to catch that lowest possible price for them and then sell several months before expiry as close to ATM as possible.

50% down is good for DCAing, unless you bought the entirety of the position all at once like a retard.

Yes, if you sell a short-term position you will pay tax on any profit you made regardless of whether or not you take another position. If you held it longer than a year and take another position you won’t owe any taxes
Well pltr has been a company for awhile and has actual customers and a product. ( unlike nkla or luk)

Software can be big margin, esp what they are touting which is some west world big data shit for governments. Software isnt going away. Issue is if they need cash they gonna dilute big time and i believe there might still be insider lock up.

I don’t see why anyone would still buy intel computers given Apple’s M series chip is vastly superior. Apple’s desktop share in Japan jumped from 15% to 27% in a few weeks after the Mac mini launched. This is probably also happening in other countries when more market research data comes out. Intel is getting eaten up by both AMD and Apple.
Canada also has the population of 3 states

Any time you sell a position, that gain or loss is factored into your net capital gain income for the  tax year the gain or loss was realized. Capital gains are broken up into short term or long term and have different tax rates

I get it. But it’s not necessarily something you’d be prescribed to use every day, for example. So given the limited clinical “demand” even if it were broadly legal as a therapeutic, it just seems like a hard area for anyone in that chain to make big money.

You say you're using ML and reddit for choosing you're calls / puts, I'm guessing if you have the data you could go back further and get more data and create a benchmark to test your algorithm. Seems less risky and makes for more robust NN moving forward. 

Also, do you weigh any stocks or just go based on how often users mention them? I'd wager the average GME posts have more substance than average PLTR.

Hey fuckface the only thing that I want DD on from New Zealand is Lord of the Rings fun facts. Here’s why GME is so screwed:

1. Losing money hand over fist when every single gaming company is posting record numbers. Xbox, ps5 sold out. Nintendo doing their thing. Everyone stuck at home playing video games. If there was a time for them to be INCREDIBLY profitable it would be now. 

2. GME isn’t good value for gamers. True fans of gaming know that you get cash back shopping at Best Buy, or Amazon. What does GME give you other than worthless points that you can buy an anime pillow with? 

3. Don’t mistake nostalgia for “cornering the market”. They aren’t the most convenient way to shop for games anymore.. it’s an aging dinosaur on its way out. Blockbuster was a cool vibe too. Look how far that got them.

why do you believe in this so much
Down 1.8%, so not so bad. And it's not just BABA, TCEHY, JD also down by same amount so seems something broadly related to big tech.
You’re an idiot lmao
My favorite green stock trades on the Canadian Venture Exchange. It actually has the word green in it's name, and is in the green tech space and sure is greening my bank account as it is up about 750% this year. Best part is that it is just getting started. Fuck I say we need some green rocket emojis fueled by renewable natural gas.

Well isn’t all the fiscal policy from COVID part of the problem? I know I paid off literally every debt me and my wife have this year. Even the car leases we paid off. 

I remember the problem with lending, and the Fed stepping into the repo market. That’s why I ask if lending doesn’t come back. 

I guess it makes sense that have cheap loans might get people to want to buy stuff. But it seems like this is a problem that they themselves made worse by giving out so much money. Thank you for the in depth write up. 

I did hear Peter Schiff mention that the Fed may also be stuck in a trap of printing money to keep bond yields down, but also it’s Peter Schiff so I take what he says very lightly.

Yes, assuming you are net positive for the year.
At your current level of cash it doesn't matter too much whether you day trade, swing trade, or long term trade from a tax perspective since it will be negligible (if anything at all).

In my early days what I found worked best for me was swing trades (1-6 months timeline), which helped me to feel out how to work out the market better. Day trades is a different racket and much easier to lose money especially when new.

Long term play is where I've concluded the real money is at (1 year or longer). In order for it to be effective you need to be allocating portions of your salary periodically to help build up. First 100K is a tough grind and could take many years to achieve.

Don't focus on lotteries... focus on consistent gains, figuring your own trading style and discipline out, and continuously learning how to better optimize earnings / hedge risks / research / read technicals. We only have so much ammunition, after all.

At this point, how many of them would care anymore? This looks a whole lot like corporate doesn't give a flying fuck anymore about their employees, and they're just looking to squeeze and scheme as much as possible before the end. They're just throwing whatever they can devise at the wall and seeing what sticks. 


Very bad signs for the company.
If I sell and enter into another position do I still pay any gains that were made after the new year? Or since it’s still at risk it’s not taxed?

The stock could literally go to zero and I would still be up 100% on initial investment.
Yahoo increased 65% between the time of S&P announcement and inclusion. A 65% increase for TSLA puts it at $665. 

Except Yahoo shares that had to be purchased were 3% of float. TSLA shares that need to be purchased make up 15% of float.

The acronym = “Tulips” ... sorry, it’s a much too arcane ref to tulip bubble of 1600s where they sold for 100k for no intrinsic value than crashed to zero...  DBX and SNOW won’t go to zero cuz have revenue, but some of their calls will, fast
Now I am
Everybody trying to beat $SPY and its lousey 10% gains a year. Even if you're one of those "buy shares and hold forever" kind of people, there's 3x leveraged ETN's that are bullish SPY and QQQ. 

ALSO if you buy shares in $PLTR, you will be a millionaire (no matter how many shares you own) by the time you realize you wish you would have just bought calls instead.

$PLTR 12/31 $40c
Alright autists, I'm eying AMZN,FB and MSFT for my weekly bull spreads. anyone have any other beaten down blue chips they're eying? I'm looking into CRM and HD but not sure If they've found their bottom just yet.

Their systems were frozen in most stores from what I gather, if that's the case they couldn't sell anything at all.
Tipping is the dumbest shit. Why do I care if some teenager bringing me food is making 30 cents an hour? Not my problem. Tipping is considered disrespectful in my country. I’m bringing my values to the US of A! 💪🇮🇳

Damn wtf, last time they posted was 210 days ago, I also know there is another pepe Silvia in WSB. I’m so confused
And they are incredibly risky.  You have to be perfectly right with no error, when my analysis supports a much higher stock price and almost risk-free money within two years.
Some retards just wanna watch their money burn

What's the bearish case for this week? 
Stimulus fails, cases increase...anything else?
Every degenerate gambler on the planet is planning on making money on TSLA this week and for that reason, I'm out.

Maybe TSLA carries them through S&P day?
There will be a massive bailout. The gov knows the housing Market and thus the economy will crash without assistance. It’s like driving a car and willingly taking the “Bridge out” rout. knowing that you will drop hundreds of feet into freezing water and die. Or you could take the detour. It’s too easy of a fix to not take.

If lending never rebounds to where it was then we’re fucked as a global entity because everything comes to a grinding halt.  Also keep in mind that there was a serious lending issue that surfaced at the end of 2019 that had nothing to do with covid.  Covid just exasperated it. 

The act of lending is the act of money creation 

The act of paying off debt is the act of money destruction 

Right now, there is a really fucked up ratio in this nation of too many people paying off personal debt and not borrowing money.  

At this very moment, money is being destroyed faster than it is being created in this nation.  Keep in mind that the U.S. dollar is the world reserve currency.  Very very bad position for the world reserve currency to be in.  The whole planet loses.

But how is this fixed?  Keep rates suppressed until it spurs lending growth, and if that doesn’t work, keep decreasing and decreasing rates until OVERALL lending growth is spurred.  

This is an oversimplification of the ebb and flow of our fiat currency I could just go on and on but trying to keep it shortish
This is my fault, more rockets will be pasted on all future analysis.  I grossly misunderstood the value of the rockets and how they conveyed seriousness in the investing world.  

When I meet my advisor next, who will shit himself on these investments, I will point out that not once did he provide me with rocket ships emoji's over the last ~20 years as my advisor. And hopefully I will have the funds to fire him, but most likely will just leave half my money with him as I am too afraid to risk it all.  But I will risk some.

Based on what?  This run is based on nothing?  They have delayed test flights further. The stock ran from 18 to 32 on absolutely zero news or fundamental change. I took advantage of the pop and sold calls against my shares, as the IV is cranked and premium is juicy.

Pfizer's yearly revenue is around $50B and the US' order for vaccines is less than $2B. It's important to recognize that this is important for society, but also important to value it as a business decision. Unless of course you think browsing /r/futurology is a viable investment strategy, tempering your expectations on how much this changes their business for the next 2-3 years is important.
Have any institutions significantly sold off shares? Otherwise this is pretty crazy, to increase shares this much at such a high price relative to the past couple years is bullish

yeah, it honestly sucks man. 😂
Volume is not amazing but I 100% agree with your assessment. DKS helped me build my home gym. They had great earnings and sold off, hard. They often run up nicely into earnings, but holding through is usually less good. Grab calls for a few months out.  60c.

these are strategies to bring people in the door and 500 more sales than they would have had. I say they do it again

Yes, but terrible work options for 401k and fee based advisors made my lifetime return low. I should have said that I lag the market and 10% outside of the few naturally wild years in market (In the last decade I believe two or three years with WILD returns, but that is the entire market and very much the exception)

Oof. BABA might move this week but CRSR still hasn't decided where it's going to go and FSR is facing a tough week with rest of EV sector.

Puts on this bragger
Exactly. If all goes well, we’re going to see crazy growth in the markets. Stagnation and decline in 1-3 years
It's a private company so the rewards are in the cashflows and the VCs would know that if it was even funded that way and secondly the number of employees for these types of companies are exceedingly low. You're not going to go public to award less than 100 people. That's insane.

I'm just saying that it just doesn't work out. I mean Roblox, which is not porn, and definitely not simply a medium for individuals to share content (requiring even fewer employees), has ... 6 people? 6. I have no idea why they would IPO except to quit because they fucking hate it and to sell it to another company while also making a shitton of cash twice.
What if lending never rebounds back to where it was? I thought we were running hot back before COVID hit anyways. 

Or is there some arbitrary number that lending is typically at all the time?

Sorry, its an argument of the ability to compensate for losses. At a certain point, you are less aggressive as you can't replace your losses with earnings.  I envy you and others in the ability to toss money away and know you have 35 years before you might need it. 

For more risky folks, go for short dated options.  For people that want to make good returns without pain, go with my recommendations.
No
Exactly.. so you want to short volatility in TSLA ie sell fucking puts, but maybe buy short term volatility in SPY because it will no doubt have some effect on VIX but is it measurable effect?

Just because it doesn't fit your narrative doesn't mean you can willfully ignore the details of the partnership. That's how investors get smoked. It's clear you can't see GME as anything other than Blockbuster, but that doesn't take away from the reality of that deal.

Market doesn't care how you interpret the information. If you are too stupid to look at the details then you will pay for being wrong.

1- Intel will outsource a small portion of low margin Atom based SOC chips to TSMC and you drew a stupid conclusion that they can't make their own chips. what an idiot.

3- fuck boomers. fuck millennials and coronnials\* \[\*- morons like you who only started trading on stimulus check after pandemic\]. Just look at cash at hand, P/E etc. Even with a tiny brain with damages cells like your can see this stock is going up in near future. 

4-  Yes AMD took 10-15% market share in Client Computing, but Intel still has 65% market share in this segment and will only improve with next generation of processors. Intel is still controlling 90+% market share in data centers. Client is off course lower margin compared to data center but hey keep living in delusion.

When can it not work? It only "doesn't work" when you get greedy and sell some covered calls that are very close to the share price and the stock price ends up going to the moon within that week. If you really were keen on keeping your 100 shares, you can always buy it back when the stock price dips or if you think it will only keep going up, buy it back with the boatload of money you've been making by selling covered calls (which is like free money). In the case of Tesla, the share price is 607 right now. The premium for a  call expiring December 18 at fucking 700 is 12.93. That is a very safe 90 dollars out of the fucking money. I highly doubt in the next week Tesla shares will fucking moon to 700. So if you have just 100 shares of Tesla (which, to be fair, is a lot. That's like 60k worth in shares), that is an easy and totally risk free 1293 dollars for this week. Unless something disastrous happens to Tesla, you can keep making at the VERY MINIMUM like 800 dollars EVERY WEEK without risking your 100 shares being sold because you're being a super safe pussy by selling way out of the money covered calls. That's an easy 40k a year brother.  That's the fucking salary of like 3 wendys employees without any of that hard bullshit work. Now our friend OP has over 400 shares. So let's say he's a HUGE PUSSY and sells way out the money calls because he really doesn't want his precious shares to be sold off. He could be easily making 3200 A WEEK and counting if we are to assume that Tesla will continue to rise in price in the years to come. So by doing absolutely fuck all, OP could be making a whopping 160k a year by simply having over 400 shares of Tesla. All risk free. OP can legit retire right now if he wanted to in my opinion.

Every poll I've seen is extremely skewed in favor of people not taking a vaccine even when available. Think it might be nursery folks whom probably take it

That's possible. I was responding to you saying that the  the reason VIX is up with everything else is an indicator that the market is shaky.

I'm saying that that isn't necessarily true.

The vaccine distribution could be causing market movements and reallocations that are inflating VIX, and the interpretation that it's shaky could really just be huge sector rotations bugging out the algorithm.

That's not what VIX means at all. VIX is not correlated to either active or perceived negative movement in the market. It is predicted volatility for a 30 day forecast. VIX can spike and the market can stay absolutely flat, or can move viciously in a tight range. It is not a sign of "shaky ground", it's a signal that a steady trend is perceived to have come to an end.

They have been getting public contracts daily now. You are correct, many are not more than 1% of their total annual revenue.   I love that. That means no individual contract makes or breaks the company that it means that as they renew contracts, they get step ups.  Additionally, it means that they broaden their experience, expertise, and customer base to further grow. 

And $57M is in the millions.  Its literally 57 individual buckets of one million dollars.

Here is some reliable sourcing from that JPM tweet you weren't sure about. I'm assuming their analyst knows more about whether ex-US data can be used for licensure than I do, and that Yahoo did their job vetting such a claim. It certainly would be scientifically sound in my opinion to consider UK and ZA data. Especially given the fact that FDA oversees plenty of HIV vaccine trials in ZA and knows the lay of the land. UK data would be fine, that goes without saying.

Good point, it would suck to die before they return.  But with years and years of my work returning less than 6% each year, I want to risk some but can't stomach any crazy risk. 

I also can't face a major loss as my family will remind me for the rest of my life.  As I told someone else, the desire to protect versus build grows fast as you age, so you find yourself accepting 5% annual returns to avoid losing more than 5% in a year.   Suddenly its been 15 years and your investments have barely doubled, your salary is 40% higher and bills are 50% higher and your house seems small.

y'kno, I was thinking Cenovus Energy would be getting some attention here as of late.   
I don't know much about much, but I did recently read that they've acquired Husky in a very synergistic deal. Cenovus is also trading below book value, and has a very similar structure to Suncor, which Warren Buffet has recently invested into. Also, given the current state of Covid in Canada, energy companies here should be ready to recover? They were also up 6.21->6.48 (USD) afterhours on Friday.   


Would appreciate someone pointing out big errors, or even better, reassuring my meagre 17 calls on Cenovus - got at 0.21 bid, Strike $8Cdn (TSX) expiry Dec18.

Yeah, old and conservative.  

Make the aggressive plays now.   The desire to protect versus build grows fast as you age, so you find yourself accepting 5% annual returns to avoid losing more than 5% in a year.  

I am trying to become much more aggressive, PLTR is definitely that.  I used to do puts and calls, but when I did it, it was literally $75 per way per trade and you paid ~$15 for SEC fees and another $0.05 per share in the contract.  Essentially, you didn't do it because you had to return several hundred to cover fees.  No YOLO with crazy fees.

Yup!
With TSLA 1% of the S&P, would it not be a good play to buy general volatility on SPY and sell puts on TSLA to arbitrage the positive volatility effect from adding TSLA to S&P, and the volatility decrease on TSLA specifically from SPY addition? Or is this already priced in.

Is Tesla really releasing an AR15?
Yeah they wouldn’t really attempt that at this point
China is the world manufacturer. Everything they make leaves China they are the world's exporter. 

The real telling sign is tesla need to goto China to be valuable. 

Tesla is "beating" China on it home turf so long as the CCP allows it.

The factories are full of Chinese employees that learn tesla mass production techniques and will take them to competitors like Nio, Xpeng and Li.

Tesla gives up its secrets to get access to the real world market. Chinese backward engineers them and resumes cash drain of western states. Not hard to see. Also the CCP can control just how many Tesla vehicles are sold by limiting their ability to expand. Jokes on you sir.

Every company in key industries is funded and backed by the CCP.

Not communicating a block buster deal to employees and getting ready for it was the point. Sign that it's an operational shit show over at GME. Boomer Sherman has 0 clue. Get the man out.

And those are just connectors.  They rely on the network effect but not like Facebook.  I can jump between AirBnB and LandBnB without any issue, they have no loyalty or moat.   A house can register on both and it doesn't matter.  

But for big data, its a network effect on each successive job.   Once they have the experience on determining when sailors in the Royal Navy are going to re-enlist or not, its easier to do the same service for the US Navy, then US Coast Guard, etc.  Each as their own contract but with unique factors that mean its a new contract for each.

Fuvkers here still do from time to time
In the mobile market, it is an apples to apples comparison as both AMD and Intel use monolithic CPU designs. No surprise, AMD is generally superior here, and it's probably their weakest segment given the maturity of Intel's platform from power management and years of focus on pushing highest possible boost speeds with their processes.

Whether or not chiplets affect performance (we're just talking servers at this point) is highly workload dependent but in the big picture, Intel is getting annihilated in performance, cost, *and* power efficiency. Which is how they hit declining sales and margins in the segment even as AMD (with TSMC) is expanding quite literally as fast as they can make chips.
It could be the dildo still stuck in your ass.

I can't stress this enough, he is a simp. The show is filled with Karens calling with complaints about maxed out credit cards, a $300 balance, a great salary and all her 5 children are grownups that financially supports her while she spends thousands of dollars on Christmas Presents. Dave then gets all nervous trying to explain basic economics like budgeting and dumping all your savings into mutual funds to never see your money ever again. 

Dave Ramsey was born a simp, therefore they should change the Show to "The Simp Son" since Karens are dyslexic and it would generally just remove confusion.

Looking back at my trading over the last year:

Day trading has been a loss.  I had a lot of small wins but some big losses wiped those out
Short term - holding less than a month.  I made some profits. 
Conclusion - had i just held my positions and not tried to time swings or dips, I’d have faired very very well.  Looking at back i missed probably 100% gains on the majority of my picks b/c i panic sold thinking i was so smart i could sell before a dip or whatever.   

Pick your plays and play them long term.  Use a little bit of your portfolio for day/swing trading if you want.  But you’ll sleep better at night and make far more money if you let things play out.
Lol no.

If I knew how to make money on my own I wouldn't be here

all cash is extra
>INTC 10nm process has more transistor density than TSMC 5nm

And their yields are still shit. Doesn't matter how good the performance is if waste isn't manageable.

>Power and performance will always be better for INTC. 

This is just a joke. INTC basically aborted their 7nm which they needed to compete with TSMC 5nm which is already online and will be flooding the market next year.

>Competitors are struggling to meet the demand on 7nm and 5nm as they have to rely on TSMC.

Yeah no shit, and the two major causes for this are COVID and the fact that Intel fucked up so badly that their products are no longer competitive and no one wants them, because their fabs are no longer competitive.

>3- history. INTC has been there and done it. AMD was gonna eat INTC for lunch in 2000s

Here's a history lesson: one major reason, possibly *the* major reason AMD couldn't overtake Intel in the past is because AMD's proprietary fabs were no longer competitive, and margins are so ridiculously favorable only to leading edge products. AMD had to pay billions to offload their shit unprofitable fabs to IBM (later GlobalFoundries) and even for years after AMD was chained by a supply agreement where they were forced to buy less competitive silicon from GloFo whether they needed it or not, rather than more competitive Samsung or TSMC. IT VERY NEARLY BANKRUPTED AMD. And that is nearly where Intel is sitting right now. Not quite as bad, but the parallels are obvious.

I'm not shorting Intel, they have a much broader portfolio than AMD or Nvidia and they still dominate market share in CPUs so they have a decent turnaround chance even if nothing is going their way right now. Sorry you fell for the INTC investor press releases all while they are hemorrhaging market share and gross margins, even though they have excess capacity and AMD doesn't.

Been riding AMD since 2.55 and Intel has never been in a worse position than right now. Value trap.

Look retard, when retail is supremely confident that something is going to happen, that’s a pretty bulletproof indicator that MMs and hedge funds are going to make sure it doesn’t so they can take the opposite side of the trade and make bank.

>If the US convinced the Dutch to not sell these tools to TSMC, they would be in big trouble.

You're completely right on this point. But why is fucking hell would the US do that while Intel can't do basically anything? Especially since Taiwan is a strong democratic ally of the US. I just really don't see this happening. Taiwan != China.

>Just a FYI. This is the main reason the Chinese have not been able to compete in the Semi market. The US has convinced the Dutch not to sell them tools.

I also found this during my research. Again you are 100% right here. This is exactly what happened and China is fucked because of it.

Let me clear, I'm not at all saying the ASML is bad buy or something. I think they are a great buy. Really my post was about TSMC so that is mainly what I am focusing on here. The case for ASML is strong, but admittedly different. They have a very different business model with different risks, different R&D strategy, etc.

When you see price action go one way but RSI go the opposite, it represents a momentum change.  We had that big dip last week but the next day, RSI was already putting in higher highs and higher lows while price was either dropping a bit more or staying flat.  Research “Divergence” with relation to stocks and you’ll see what I’m talking about.

Don’t worry. There’s gonna be a random gap up to +1% at some point tonight.
I think this is gonna go to the moon after the s&p 500 addition. For any other stock I would say its priced in, but I don't think people will take profits. I think Tesla stock benefits from everyone who's in it being greedy as hell. That 40% or so of the float that's getting bought on the 21st is gonna be EXPENSIVE; I'm thinking a 30% spike on that day, and then we flatten out for a while or just keep running up. No dip due to profit taking. Not even a little one. It goes against all logic and reason but that's how it is.
Watch my NET calls, Twlo shares and calls.  All far out expiry though.
According to Clincaltrials.gov the last data of Vaxarts phase I trial data collection was on  Dec. 10th.  It is definitely going to pass phase I results.  Look for the data late this year, early next year.   I have some  12/24 15c lottos as well as a bunch of 1/15/21 10c I got when they were at 67 cents a share, now at a dollar and change.  Good chance they both print.   Varxart's vaccine is a pill  that is shelf stable.  No refrigeration needed at all.  If they do a phase 2/3 combo trial (a real thing), they might make it out of trials this fall or definitely early next year.  Covid will be with us for a the next few years, especially if a good chunk of people do not take the vaccine at first.   

They could be the novavax of the second wave of  covid vaccines.  There will not be a large second gen. of vaccines but Vaxart definitely has an edge in that they do not need   
 any refrigeration, needles, or  glass vials.  

I own no shares of vaxart, I have only calls.

What if it suddenly emerges there IS a causal relationship? Something like this would likely bring everything down.  We should know pretty soon since they are vaccinating a lot in UK and will be starting here shortly.  A flu vaccine was withdrawn in 2000-2001 flu season in Switzerland due to causing bell's palsy.  This was an intranasal vaccine though, not intramuscular.  It's slightly concerning that news could break any moment of people getting bell's palsy.

Only plays ive hit on are NIO(@36 sold @54) and early PLTR(@20 sold @28). 

I cashed nio out cause it was stagnating for a day or two and i thought it was a good point to stop and look for something else (PLTR)

With PLTR i did the noob mistake and double downed on options for 5/31 44c when it was at the 52 week high, but i sold my profitable calls and put them into cruise leaps. 

Average time id say is just when they became profitable enough for me to move on.

Until the management team got railroaded by Carl Icahn who destroyed the company and led it to its demise. 

[https://www.businessinsider.com/carl-icahns-blockbuster-mistake-2016-5](https://www.businessinsider.com/carl-icahns-blockbuster-mistake-2016-5)

" Company executives continued to defend their business model and even shelved an online rental service they had developed, even though it was the company’s best bet to compete with Netflix. 

They \[Icahn\] were frustrated that it lost money, and decided instead to focus on brick-and-mortar stores.

Icahn finally gave up in March 2010. He sold the majority of his Blockbuster shares at an average price of 26 cents per share. He was down around 98 percent. Blockbuster declared bankruptcy later the same year."

In GME case, Ryan Cohen is actively trying to do the opposite of what happened with Blockbuster.

Appreciate the intel. I scooped shares on a dip just based off chatter on this upcoming test. Just seeing the Fomo on all this other EV and tech gimmick stuff told me that this had big meme potential. Literal rockets. Welcome to 2020 investing. Figured I'd play this launch and see where it went then maybe play the next two. 

It seems like a very flawed program at the moment. If it settles in the single digits I might play some long dated calls into the next launch. Definitely not holding long term unless they show some reliability and somehow surpass Space X & the others. 

Historically going to space is a deadly game. Only takes one awful incident to scare everyone away for a long time.

Drop 10k-15k in stocks, or if you really want to be risky drop them in options w 2022-2023 exp dates. That news is pretty old and is already priced in. I think its a good company. But in the immediate short term you arent really going to see 50% days anymore, so play for long term.
What does this mean, sir? Please explain
You accidentally the whole thing!

You're not wrong. We're in an era when we can double our money on shares or calls that we bought while taking a shit two weeks prior, all while half the intersections in my city have someone shaking a cup asking for spare change. 

I haven't been actively trading for very long, but it has already exposed me to the truth behind "the rich get richer and the poor stay poor." Feels wrong that I can make more in day by pressing buttons on my phone than that guy at the intersection will make all month--and I certainly wasn't served what I have now on silver platter by any means--but there is definitely an existential crisis that comes alongside being financially secure. A food pantry or something like Toys For Tots isn't a bad idea at all, and will always make you feel good.

I scalp with 75%, I have 25% invested for long term. Because cash account, I forced a rotation of constantly settling money, thereby giving me plenty to day trade with daily. So the 75% is split into ~15% daily capital to play with.

Brand new retard ironically calls someone else retard while simultaneously espousing bullshit opinion. Hedge funds, indexes that are allowed to purchase early, and retail will be funneling in because the dip has already happened and we've seen this 1000 times before. Tesla runs hard the week leading up to an event, sells off the day of. The highest possible returns are buying a fuck load of TSLA leading up to inclusion and dumping on the 18th before close. You wouldn't know that, because you're literally 3 months new. This is why people who are brand new to the stock market and to WSB shouldn't be allowed to post here.

But you can’t ever reverse the cash account I can get my day trades back in no time. Or honestly just deposit 20k in if I really wanted to. I know I’d end up risking it though and I don’t wanna do that. I just cashed out 10k last week

AMAZON WEEKLIES ARE ABOUT TO PRINT
Cohen built a category killer from scratch with CHWY. Amazon cannot go head to head with a specialty store in a specific category. They are too diversified. If Cohen gets CEO then he will be able to take GME and win back market share for the gaming category through his expertise. Lots of companies out there that compete with Amazon. They do not have a monopoly over products and they offer nothing special to their customers. No reason GME couldn't beat AMZN in a singular category with the right person in charge who has been successful before in doing just that.

Assuming you are using RH, they charge 5% APR on margin up to 10k. If you have 10k you can buy 20k of ARKs for $500 in interest a year. Less leverage this way than most calls unless they are deep ITM, however you would only need a 2.5% increase of the underlying to break even in a year. It seems like you want an ITM call so your leverage wouldn’t be anything crazy. I’d just explore both options and make sure you understand what you are doing before you put all of your money on the line

I thought about selling a portion of mine but I just don’t see any way this companies does anything but free fall to sub $20.
Yes but this has to do with a lot of models following the amazon one. Bezos told investors close to 20 years ago that the company would not turn a profit for many years. It worked. He was able to patiently squeeze other businesses out and reach a massive economy of scale. They now turn a large profit and reinvest into the company every year.

Other tech companies followed this type of plan including ones like Uber and Lyft but as we see them increase scale and market share they are not getting any closer to profitability. Its basically using the promise of "well amazon did it so be patient and it will pay off for us too" but it's a lie. Only a matter of time before it fails. Still money to be made but its risky money.

They are not hiding it, they’re highlighting it. So anyone who bought into GameStop and actually looked into the business already knew this was gonna happen.

i hope psth holders are ready to eat fresh, because you guys are getting subway
Just build your own! It is super easy and you aren't paying a premium for someone else to assemble it.
Why do you want him to do it wrong?
you are the right, you can 100% do that. The risk comes when you hold that covered call and let’s say at a $13 strike but someone on WSB posts a sick meme about that SPAC and it’s pumped to $30. You just missed out on $1700.
That’s rough. In the end if you’re trying, they know you’re trying, and it’s still not working then you need to cut slack. They should understand your circumstances as you have your own life you had to start. Maybe cutting them off will make them come to you. 

Maybe try and find a partner to focus that energy on. Not to sound like that’s the only reason to find a partner. But obviously using you energy to reconnect with your family is both not working and unhealthy for your mental well-being.

Yes we are literally flat for two week at this level
what would you get if you mixed PTON with TSLA?

Yea by Oracle or Microsoft or Facebook

 If a stock remains stagnant for 2 days, I pull out. I could be making 1-2% a day off of ARKK doing nothing rather than watch a stock sit with no movement for 2-3 days.

Yes, this is true. Tomorrow it should go up as the vaccines have been officially approved in the U.S.
ZYNG has been a dud for years, everyone knows these numbers and doesn’t buy in. I don’t see this getting to $20 in the next few years. I did own 100 shares but sold last time it was above $9.50 maybe will reenter but I see this as something that will remain to be overlooked for a while unless something big changes.

I think win-win for everyone involved (except shorts) is if Sherman and Cohen become co-CEOs for the eventual transition. Everyone gets to keep their job (no poison pill needed), Sherman can focus on the fundamental / cost management and Cohen can focus on e-commerce expansion.

It is that obvious, mild +.05 futures still regularly yield us a +.8 day. We rarely get +.5 futures.
You think it’ll really go up more though? Seemed pretty downward by the end of the day
Guaranteed +200% opening day. Pronhub getting disrupted. Also OPs mom is on there.
The downside is that money could be on PLTR calls
Red day. Buy.
MODS!!!! HES FUCKING BACK
Sold a shitload of PLTR puts on Friday and they are already up 20%.

Theta gang is such easy money, you can be retarded and still win by selling to people more retarded than you are.

You mean a 10:1, right?
Its basically a risk arb play with a huge skew. 

Micheal Kao on Twitter has the best explanation on the finance side of the trade

HoldenWalker99 on twitter has the best explantion on the administrative side of the trade

I've been in this trade for a few years and it has been incredibly underwhelming. Also it seems to have attracted the most insane group of people other than TSLA

Tldr: 

70% in next year you can make 300ish% 

30ish% you lose 50%

Some non zero% you lose 90%
GME
Everyone buying DBX tomorrow
Also bought puts near close. Looking at its history its only ever dipped soon after rising that high all at once. If it keeps going higher, its because I bought puts
Remind me! 1 day
Very wild assumptions:
1) that trump will concede
2) that the market will care about a lame duck conceding after elections have been certified

Don’t think I’ll buy that one chief
SPAC question if somebody can help. Example SPAC is $11.4 a share. Covered call premiums are fat enough to easily get cost basis below the $10 floor. As long as you sell before the merger happens, how is this not risk free? If it runs through your strike, fine. You made the difference plus premium. If it drops to 10 you can redeem or keep selling CCs. Not a believer in free money so what am I missing?

I mean... You just saw the past weeks how A LOT of tards donated things to bank foods.

My personal history is marked by 2 things that happenes to me in one week.
I wanted a big problem with Iran to see my military stocks to go up, and I wanted Florida to be more Covid fucked up to buy Disney cheap.

Once I realized that behavior, I began going to church, even volunteering and helping in whatever I could.

And I am saying this as an atheist who didn't go to church one single day in his Life.

You need to balance yourself I think. Being aware of it is the first step tho. So, good for you, I guess

pm me
Yes. 

The moment I realized that money was easy to make, harder than I thought to destroy, and that converting cash into something else was a hollow thing definitely messed me up. I mean buying really expensive this or that, esp. from my upbringing, never appealed to me even after I made the money so I kind of don't live in a house that would "reflect" my wealth and a bunch of other stuff that I should have, I don't, because I can't imagine needing or wanting it.

The truth that money flows like water even in stable times is kind of unnerving; I absolutely hate that the only real value of fiat money is to make more money with the money and that there is literally nothing else to do with it. I mean essentially you have to just give it away to defeat the purpose of it.

Yeah I’m at the point of stepping away. I’m constantly buying birthday presents, sending texts on holidays, etc. 

I don’t seem to exist in their world. But I think it may be the opposite of your situation. After I graduated high school I just went into this hole of non stop work, didn’t have time for funerals, weddings, birthdays, anything, whatever. Only work. 

7 years later, I’ve hit my short term goals and took this time of shutdown to relax a bit and reevaluate my long term goals, one of them is bringing my family closer.

Seems like that 7 years could’ve been used to at least start those attempts, I’m finishing a race everyone else has already ran. Might be time to start my own family or something who knows

Hey the LEGENd.

And a lot of games: pick a YOLO with darts, a contest about Who Can make more tendies with 100$ in 1 hour, brain scans to see how smoth is tour brain, the tits up roller coaster...

My 2cents:  I was hyper excited about SPCE awhile ago, but anyone long term bullish has to understand that spacex has not yet offered recreational space flight, but its a natural evolution.   SPCE offers an antiquated methodology of achieving space flight and at a higher price than the starship will eventually cost.  Therefore, long term SPCE will be crushed s they are only now trying to make work technology which will be replaced in a matter of years.

Damn that sucks bro. My family has kinda been trying to reach out to me. Like sending texts and shit, but at this point I’m so far gone past them and in my own life it’s just awkward to talk to them.

I don’t know anything about you but I’d give it a real good try. Like really give it your all, no bullshitting. Explain that you want a relationship with them and whatnot, and try and make a connection. Possible speak to a family counselor. 

But if it doesn’t work out you just gotta step away, and then you won’t have that doubt that you could’ve done more.

Another massive stimulus would put it at $30. Looks like it will be in the trillions if there is another one. Also if the incoming administration gets even half the shit they want I'll drive prices on safe metals.. but none of that will happen by the 15th

Well here is part of the con. They keep saying they need to scale but they have scaled to almost every major city in the world, have opened a food delivery service at scale and are still about 30% off revenue needed to break even. They will never turn a profit.

Clearly if this valuation was just autos it would be over valued. Also really bad comparison, Tesla sells  $10,000 90% margin option with 30%+ take rate before full functionality, vertically integrates their entire supply chain and produce evs profitability. Legacy OEM’s also selling to a dying industry so their multiple is fucking clapped. Why would they deserve the same multiple on earnings... Last thing you said their market cap is more than their competitors, they actually dont have any so technically you cant say that, maybe when teslas market share drops from 90% in the US we can say that.

That's just patently untrue, even N7+ has greater transistor density than Intel 10nm

Intel 10nm = 100MT/mm

TSMC N7 = 96MT

TSMC N7+ = 113MT

TSMC N5 (A14) = 134 MT

TSMC N5 (theoretical) = 170MT

1. we are not the most retarded sub, that would be r/politics

2. stop is an order that triggers if the price goes beyong the price treshold and immediately becomes a market order

-pro: you don't lose money if shit hits the fan

-con: can only be used when the market is open and if the price gaps AH you are fucked

3. limit is an order which specifies a strict price for the trade, i.e. a treshold.. for a buy it only fills when the price is below the treshold and for sell - when the price is above it

pro: some exchanges only allow limit orders AH; you set the price at which you trade so you avoid huge discrepancies

con: for big orders you might get partially filled; might miss the price by small margins

Sunflower seeds are popular in trail mix, multi-grain bread and nutrition bars, as well as for snacking straight from the bag. They’re rich in healthy fats, beneficial plant compounds and several vitamins and minerals. These nutrients may play a role in reducing your risk of common health problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

It is a bubble. The problem is they think they're gonna time it lol
I don't.

Kids aren't entitled to a free console, this is the nature of supply and demand, many poor kids wouldn't be able to afford a console if it was $100 that's just how life is.

I don't feel bad for making money doing business with the greedy and the impatient.

Disney+ has nothing to do with movie theaters. Disney’s stock jumped because of them hitting the streaming market. Don’t give advice starting with, (my own comment posted on a Sunday) “I started investing two days (FRIDAY) ago here’s my DD on Disney stock”.

Yea okay
I guess you don’t realize that for most people even 500 would be a huge expense. It’s the kids who won’t get it for Christmas, and the parents who can’t afford to pay 1000 or more who suffer, and that’s most people man. Look, if you feel good about it, then no worries, it’s just not the sort of thing I could do and sleep well at night. I guess you don’t have kids.

Good question and yes from a historical P/E ratio perspective, it might look less desirable. However, if they can grow top-line at least \~20-30% a year while DTC scales, then it's very reasonable that investors may give them "tech" multiples ala Netflix. Btw, consensus expectations are for \~22% revenue growth next year for Disney.

Disney had already run up 30%. It's blown up more it's still going to lose a ton of money from the meat space part of the business for almost a year they don't think streaming will make money for at least four years and they are giving up billions and billions of licensing revenue by taking content back onto their own service and not selling the streaming rights to Netflix etc so this isn't some clean all new profit gain by their new ambition

You can buy multi-family homes under the VA loan, you are suppose to live there for 2 years, which was the plan, but had a family emergency, so I live with my mom and brother r n.

ASML dictates who has the EUV capacity, which dictates how many sub-7nm wafers each foundry can image  practically.

TSMC's willingness and ability to secure capacity from ASML is a big reason for their current advanced node dominance.

You should care about ASML because they are TSMC's gatekeeper and rumours are Samsung is going to invest heavily in its foundry going forward. Every EUV unit shipped to Korea is a unit TSMC won't have. If you have a significant TSMC position you should care about the monopoly they are 100% reliant on.

(long ASML and TSMC)

figure it out.
yes I'm big on Disney now too but what a lot of you retards have to recognize is that while they will be generating lots of new future revenue they are giving up a ton of revenue from licensing this stuff to other streaming services this is not all new fresh revenue there is a big cost to what they're doing not just rolling it out but the opportunity cost by not pursuing licensing deals and keeping the material on their own service

So was every tyrant in history. Doesn’t mean shit. Its a way to rationalize your shitty decisions. That’s why my first comment got ten upvotes immediately and no one liked yours lol

One day you’ll get screwed over the same way and it’ll come full circle. Couldn’t see your favorite musician cause the scalper wanted $500 for the tickets or can’t build your new computer cause parts on back order until Christmas while they sit in some desperate neckbeards basement and collect body odor.
True story:  in college I got an internship with a small accounting firm.  Next semester they asked me to stay on to onboard the next set of interns.  Day the interns started I divided them into three teams and set up a series of elaborate accounting puzzles.  I told them if they could solve the puzzle, I would give them extra credit in their internship.  Each team, when they had completed their puzzles received part of a clue, which when combined directed them to a folder in the firms drive.  The folder contained a text document with a link,  which resulted in a rickroll.  

They all just looked at me blankly, only like 1 guy got it, and he only chuckled weakly.  I then told them that I had no ability to give them any extra credit, that was up to their professors.  

Moral of the story:  puts on college students.

I'm a businessman doing business.

It isn't the kids who would be paying $500 for a PS5 anyway,  it's the parents who are willing to pay whatever price rather than explain to their children that they're waiting patiently for the console to be avaliable.
ur forgetting the stimulus announcement that’s coming tmrw
I mean. We use them.
Not a great price. I've seen some desktops with 3070s and similar specs for a few hundred less. You should have bought on Cyber Monday lol. I'd watch the prices for a few weeks. Also, just build your own. Once you know how to do it you have a lifelong skill that will come in handy once every 5-7 years.

Megan Bank how
According to the wiki article, it swelled up overnight. He went to undergo a two week treatment but they couldn't find a solution so they continued to grow.
Two years later he underwent an eight week treatment and it still didn't resolve it. At this point they had grown to the point where he was nearly immobile.

The surgery required to correct it costs seven figures and he only got $2000 in paypal donations and had to suffer in pain with the dehabilitating condition until the medical center agreed to perform the surgery for free.

Years later he died in 2014.

What's sad is OP using a documentary footage of a deceased man who suffered years in excruciating and dehabiliating pain in a tasteless shitpost meme to gain internet points. What's even sadder are the upvotes.

Gay bears trying to prove otherwise.
Yeah the stock already had run up 30%.  It's still going to lose money for a long time.  And the meat space was never three profitable part of Disney it was the media part and that's getting shifted around.  Surethey are going to generate lots of new revenue with Disney plus but what a lot of people are ignoring is that they are also giving up huge amounts of licensing revenue because they're going to be keeping the content themselves instead of putting it on other streaming services for big money
How long does it take to get to 50% max profit?

Sure it made Amazon money but you can’t say the same of like fb which mostly is just destroying modern democracies by helping people be as ignorant and tribal and mentally ill as possible. 

Oracle is pretty ruthless and has a reputation for dbaggery, Larry Ellison would be a good cyborg overlord. Probably should get calls on them too.

I mean yeah, that's what happened during the dotcom bubble to a lot of companies. Most never recovered and the rest took years to come back. Should Tesla crash to a still very high 200 there is no guarantee that it will recover or that it will give you any returns in the next 10 years. There were probably tons of people who got burned a second time by that bulltrap and are still in the red or made barely any profit up to now.

How do you figure with a $300 billion valuation???  They even said they don't expect to be profitable until 2024.  Netflix has a valuation of $220 billion.  Disney's meat space is still going to eat ass for almost another year.  Sat best they have another 10% up side.  But the market may declare them "tech" and bid their multiple up.

I get that. Lesbian porn is more commonly watched by both men and women than male gay porn being watched by both genders (aside from the gay/bi community).

Thank you, was good food for thought and good explanation from a female POV. (I feel like explanation is the wrong word here but for some reason can’t think of a better word right now)

>Not to mention the huge moat intel has in the form of its foundries, massive revenue/profit, government contracts and market share.

You know what buddy. I think you might be right. They have a fucking massive economic moat. Made up of:

* Foundries which are so bad INTC won't use themselves: [https://www.pcmag.com/news/intel-to-decide-on-tapping-third-party-foundry-for-7nm-chips-by-early-2021](https://www.pcmag.com/news/intel-to-decide-on-tapping-third-party-foundry-for-7nm-chips-by-early-2021)
* Their great margins which have sunk to 2009 levels: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/23/intel-gross-margin-shrinks-to-lowest-since-2009-on-product-delays.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/23/intel-gross-margin-shrinks-to-lowest-since-2009-on-product-delays.html)
* Their amazing government contracts which they can't fulfill and have delayed for FOUR FUCKING YEARS. [https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/doe-confirms-aurora-delayed-frontier-will-be-first-exascale-supercomputer/](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/doe-confirms-aurora-delayed-frontier-will-be-first-exascale-supercomputer/)
* Oh don't forget their market share of which they lost almost 20% of in last year alone: [https://www.techspot.com/news/87436-amd-chipping-away-intel-cpu-market-share.htm](https://www.techspot.com/news/87436-amd-chipping-away-intel-cpu-market-share.htm)

I say go for it bro. YOLO your life savings on INTC calls. Sounds like you really did your research and know your stuff.
I’d shit money
Only reason it matters is because it’s the only one normal dipshits understand (because it’s easy), so it becomes a self-fulfilling indicator. People see RSI (usually on the 14 chart) near 90, they sell. See it under 50, they buy. Only reason I pay attention to it is not because it’s a valuable metric (which it really isn’t), but because normal people follow it in choosing to buy or sell.
Holy shit, who'd of thought..

There’s a local, off color, joke about the origins of the name. The lake is 20-something miles long.

I got in last week around 13.75.  A few hours later a guy on CNBC talked about it tripling and it started to take off after hours.   Im buying more on Monday.  It should have a great run.  A lot of people like Foley and have confidence in him as well.  I was going to invest some in GHIV but the confidence and momentum doesn't seem nearly as strong as GHIV.  Maybe people who were going to invest in GHIV will not be investing in BFT instead.

Haha jokes on you, none of my portfolio recovered from March!
Bought a big chunk of shares at $22. Big chunk of $22.50 and then $22 calls soon after (near the $$$). Calls were $3 each, pretty expensive. This thing has boomed for a month. Easily my best play ever. Learned my lesson from past flops and bought $33 puts (also $3) to cover all my calls on Friday afternoon.

Staying up tonight to try and offload the shares in pre market. Never done anything pre market before. Those puts are saving me from major suffering though because they theoretically cover and become more profitable under $22.
I’m all in on March 100c’s
Had a great night of coke and alcohol last night. Got some absolutely vicious pumps into my girl, gave her a nasty créme pie and felt like a god, but I'm going sober for the rest of the year. Anyways, uh ARKK to 130 sometime this week - hopping back on that train tmo.

I have to imagine ~50% or more of the 90 mill they picked up already are parents like me who got it for Disney movies and shows that already exist. That means they need to maintain the same rate of new subscribers without slowing down, despite a huge group of people already being subscribed. There are 140 million households in North America and 195 million in Europe. The math is a bit of a stretch unless they plan to really hit the asian market with content too

Depends what you are trading, but the stock market in general is momentum based. Look at tesla for example. Even though on the quarterly chart it has an rsi well above 70 for every quarter, and has an rsi if 94 on the yearly chart, it doesn’t mean you should buy puts. RSI is a good timer for entering and exiting already existing trades, but you should never trade based on only 1 indicator. Also iv is a huge problem rsi doesn’t look at
Every spac has a lawsuit/investigation attached to it. Part of the game

Forgive me Father for I have sinned ... I've been lurking on WSB for almost a year and saw all those degenerates YOLO'ing their life saving on TSLA and NIO! I wanted to be the next fucking ELON! I wanted to be like them ... a proper fucking AUTIST! So ... I took all of my money + what I've been earning by selling crack and my ass to all those gay bears and I DID WHAT A RETARD DOES! YOLO'ed it ALL LIKE A PROPER FUCKING IDIOT!   


Can I have 10k daddy?! Pleassseeeee?!   


The end
It took 9 months (March) at $35.61 to a recent high of $213. It would be amazeballs if JMIA pulls that or even half that in the same time frame. With that said, JMIA is at SE's March 2019 at $38.13. Might have to buy more shares and calls

How do you distinguish a panic sell off from just a normal sell off? If you sell, that means you think a given stock is at it's peak valuation for at least the near future. "Panic" sellers are the same, it's just that those sellers are greater in number and make their sell all at the same time. It's also totally dependent on what happens after the sell whether people are considered "panic sellers" or people just abandoning a sinking ship.

Saying stockholders should do X to benefit all of them is just a more complicated pyramid scheme. Saying to pump the value or keep it stable by not selling is just an attempt to lure new people in that will take the fall for you if the stock inevitably runs out of this artificial steam.
Greed really is limitless. The same people praying their calls break even also hold when they are up 500% so they can get to 1000%. (before their shit craters and they repeat step 1)

You need to explain to me exactly why OnlyFans needs the money. I don't believe they do for a second.

E: Lesson Time: A lot of investors seem to think that companies *want* to go public. They do not. A company will not go public if it can help it because going public fucking sucks balls and includes all sorts of bullshit that you don't need if you just run the company. Porn in general is likely never going to go public and with Niki Minaj et al grouping up around OnlyFans further it is highly, highly unlikely that they need money to expand.

My asshole got drilled. 5-10%.
Isn't he just guessing on the 10% number?

Also Gamestop's annual revenue is $6.5bn.  A $200mm increase doesn't move the needle that much.  Certainly not enough to make up for the quickly dying physical sales.  Because now you also have to consider that the all access package comes with like 100 games so they likely won't be walking into gamestop to buy games as often as before.

So previously = $49 for console purchase + any revenue made on physical game sales for 2 years

Versus now = $89 for 2 years, likely no to few physical game sales.

Doesn't seem that exciting, personally.
Does this mean folk will effectively get a share of my girlfriend?

Not hard to believe since the surgery costs seven figures. Who can afford that? 

According to the wiki article, it swelled up overnight. He went to undergo a two week treatment but they couldn't find a solution so they continued to grow. 

Two years later he underwent an eight week treatment and it still didn't resolve it. At this point they had grown to the point where he was nearly immobile.

The surgery required to correct it costs seven figures and he only got $2000 in paypal donations and had to suffer in pain with the dehabilitating condition until the medical center agreed to perform the surgery for free.

Years later he died in 2014.

What's sad is OP using a documentary footage of a deceased man who suffered years in excruciating and dehabiliating pain in a tasteless shitpost meme to gain internet points. What's even sadder are the upvotes.

Are you saying the male form isn't beautiful? 

In a more explicit fashion, I'm saying that if you are attracted to women, lesbian porn is probably appealing, regardless of your own gender. 

Similarly, if you are attracted to men, gay porn is probably appealing, whether or not you yourself are a man.

So if you don't understand the appeal of gay porn, you probably understand the appeal of lesbian porn. And you can translate from there.

Completely incorrect. they aren’t importing bud for recreational purposes because of federal law. Thats the whole point of biden/harris decriminalizing cannabis. It will open up the borders for international investment in the cannabis sector. 

Also, the US already imports cannabis from canadian companies for medical purposes. TLRY is an example of that.

I've had similar thoughts. The big problem they have is the switch to digital consoles so they should incentives purchasing disk consoles. Start a membership $19.99 per month with different tiers where users can rent games, consoles and hardware possibly even rent to own. They could also allow customers (only those with a subscriptions) to buy and sell games at market price think a physical eBay. At this point they could even offer a disk version for digital price if the user buys a year gaming subscription.

If the NAV really is $10 then this is an easy way to make 20+% ROI for a month of time. I think the worry would probably be the merger happens quickly and then the NAV is no longer a thing and technically the stock could go below $10.

Test flight failed.

He predicts SPCE will dip 25% because of weak hands.

He says buy the dip because there's no competition right now in space tourism, so this is all you fuckers got until spacex shows their tit and everybody goes there instead.

He predicts recovery because why not.

Personally I don't see it dipping 25% (that'd be around 24). Unless we forget to build supply depots and get supply locked.
They will, have 2 wait 2 weeks after ipo

I don't have a recommendation- I do believe that this one is experiencing early stages of FOMO so it might keep going until the high teens. That being said, it might be good to buy overtime, some tomorrow and some the following couple days. That way you might catch some dips.

Yea but when your product only accounts for less than 2% of total market and the companys market cap is worth more than most of your competitor s combined that could be a red flag
It’s not a glitch you probably lost all your money

Guy I know is trying to promote teaching options on his IG. His first post is ‘Webull allows unlimited day trades’....I’m not going to tell him, just going to watch how this unfolds
[deleted]
That literally means nothing for a few reasons: 1. futures are less liquid so it's more susceptible to those changes; 2. it's still well within the normal range; and 3. a 10% jump is nothing, it had a higher high on Friday than what it's at today and look at how Friday turned out.
Okay

We got our gap up as expected. No coincidence on the timing of the bipartisan relief bill. 3675 is an important zone, and something to take note of how futures performs around there by morning. It was our support and resistance this whole month.

If you've got long positions that print on Monday morning, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take some off. This week is probably the last chance for any meaningful dip. VIX and more importantly, VVIX has been creeping up, and most of the VIX suppression after the elections should be gone by now.

You're completely right, honestly. If blockbuster revised itself into a digital company, basically what netflix is now, they would be worth the same amount. Looking from the chart of blockbuster it seems the price used to be $30 a share, so...yeah, an 18x from where they peaked.

What question is that? Obviously it'll go down.. Tesla is their largest holding but they have other stocks too which will balance out. But that's the problem with growth names. They can go up exponentially but also get hit the hardest

A rich couple was going out for the evening. The lady of the house decided to give the butler, Mike, the night off. 

She said they would be home very late and he should just enjoy his evening.

As it turned out, the wife did not have a good time at the party, so she came home early. She walked into the house and eyed Mike sitting alone in the dining room. She called for him to follow her. She led him to the master bedroom. She closed and locked the door. She looked at him and smiled.

‟Mike. Take off my dress.” He did so, carefully.

‟Mike. Take off my stockings and garter.” He silently obeyed her.

‟Mike. Remve my bra and panties.” The tension mounted as he complied.

Finally she looked at him and said, ‟Mike. If I ever catch you wearing my clothes again, you are fired.”
What’s dis?
Well. Tbh, they had 2-3good weeks. But enough is enough.

Idk about OF. Adult sites don’t want the regulations and annoyances from shareholders. Although apparently OF intends to crack down on certain adult content since that wasn’t their intended use. Although if thats the case, their revenue would decrease tremendously and then it wouldn’t be a lucrative investment.

No, I am not referring to NKLA; it is true that it is one of the worst things to happen, but actually these are really old vehicles and the last time this occurred was (get this) slightly around the end of the dot.com bubble and (surprise, surprise) there was some activity during the 2008 recession. 

I appreciate business so I get that SPACs should be sharks and they are. For the most part they absolutely are because the statement, "they should be carefully monitored" can't at all be combined with how they are intended to work since SPACs naturally dodge IPO requirements which are meant to protect investors. Hyllion and all the other structured items that murdered investors but made the acquisition company plenty of money because of how they are built are just common and par for the course. They are "advanced" in my opinion. 

I mean the odds that you won't get some bullshit through a traditional IPO are much higher; sure, yes, anyone can be fraudulent and an asshole, but I doubt that NKLA would have made it through a traditional IPO because they have no money, no plant, and a bank would have a harder time validating it's valuation since doing so puts the neck on the line of the bank. 

For the SPAC itself, even if Ackerman ripped everyone off, what's he care? The company is basically sold to the public so if it tanks to the deepest areas in the Mariana Trench he made his money. Basically Hyllion is common, not rare, for SPAC performance and the winners are few and the structures are obscured and the bet is not ... clairvoyant. 

I actually have nothing against SPACs but it is worth noting that the companies that many of these are merging with are just either shady or stupid. They have poor records, are private so they don't have to disclose everything, usually are older or kind of obscure, and generally no one knows exactly what they do or exactly how large they are. And none of that has to be disclosed formally before the listing.
There is no price on stock B you dummy. They're private companies going public. Stock A changes tickers to stock B. End of story.

I’ve spent a lifetime around leveraged ETFs. I’m talking about the next three quarters as the vaccine is administered and the world opens back up.

This is correct. Anti trust breakups are phenomenal for shareholders.
Guess not
If /ES fills opening gap and we have hourly close above 3672.50ish, it will be time for all bears to close out puts and go into calls. Can't really argue with a trend reversal like that.

**[Godwin's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's law)**

Godwin's law, short for Godwin's law (or rule) of Nazi analogies, is an Internet adage asserting that "as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1". That is, if an online discussion (regardless of topic or scope) goes on long enough, sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to Adolf Hitler or his deeds, the point at which effectively the discussion or thread often ends. Promulgated by the American attorney and author Mike Godwin in 1990, Godwin's law originally referred specifically to Usenet newsgroup discussions. He stated that he introduced Godwin's law in 1990 as an experiment in memetics.

Posted my $3K SLV YOLO for everyone to roast me. 

Here’s to hoping for $30 by EOM
If China and Europe doesn't fuck this up, we could easily see +1.5% by morning.
You are in serious denial...  the stock needs to make a HUGE move for you to just make your losses back.
Not a bad play after the big rally and their stance into streaming. Will definitely see a pullback.
Are you refering to NKLA by any chance? Because yes, SPACs can be a money sink, which is why they have to be carefully monitored. There are many risks but that is not to say that good companies never use them.

Going trough the traditional IPO is not a guarantee that the company is not fraudelent or shady, despite the more strict regulation.
hahah yes

bear r fuk

at least for the next 2 days
hopefully. i bought at an extremely high premium ($6.10). Wouldn’t the volatility need to go up like crazy for me to be ITM? Still learning options

Yeah never trust those financial advisors or whatever. They might be worth having money in once you have enough funds at retirement. Even then, it's probably a bad choice. I'd rather put my money in SP500

CRM you better fucking go up tomorrow
Looks like it! 

I'd like to see the /ES opening gap get filled and an hourly close above 3672 for confirmation, but so far so good for the bulls. Can't really argue bears are in control right now, so far at least.
CRM is a long term play. It held support at 220 successfully for several sessions now and that's a big positive. If it shoots up to 230, it will definitely fill the 238 gap and may go into the 240s.

OTOH, if it breaks down below 216, it will go into the 205s, IMHO. Risk/reward is excellent at these levels and will bet the farm if it gets to 205, btw!

By next earnings, it will be in the 260+s is my bet!

Maybe you're right, maybe not. If you have been investing in it for two years, I'm happy for you because you probably made a lot of money with it already. But saying it has happened before so it will happen again is a dangerous game. It's trading way too high for many months now and call me a gay bear, I'm certain it will crash sooner or later. 
If it's in a year, good for the people who are still investing now. But if it's next week, RIP

As I said, maybe it's the right decision to still put you money in TSLA, but it's definitely not safe.

Disney will be the biggest and most powerful media company in the entire world for decades. What Netflix and everyone realized a few years back was they’d no longer be able to license content like other companies’ showed and movies because everyone  will start their own streaming services. Their problem is they’re having to try to start new franchises from scratch. Disney is sitting on the most valuable content catalog in the world including shows from ABC and now Fox...and they’re only just now staring to spin off tons of content from all these valuable franchises. There will not be a parent anywhere in the developed world who is not sending $7 per month to Disney.

If it goes on another major run then yeah, the premiums could increase enough for you to recoup a good bit of it without necessarily being ITM. You’re still a couple months out, and if you feel confident that might happen in that timeframe then that’s the play. 

I’m just saying if it was me, I wouldn’t hold on to them too long. Maybe wait another couple of weeks and see if it gets hot again, then sell. Hold it much longer than that though and theta decay will eat your lunch.
Dude, if you provide evidence that the merger is likely, or even a tiny bit more detail - then I’ll buy in.

I think it was a great decision. 

Countries like Greece could barely agree to austerity measures when the EU was trying to bail them out from insolvency. 

Italy and many other EU countries are too liberal and broke, meaning they're essentially having countries like Germany and Britain bail them out. 

At this point, the EU needs Britain more than Britain needs them.

I'm sorry she won't fuck you.
You're clueless about BB's current and future business if you think it's an awful company. But that prevalent lack of awareness by the entire investing public is what's keeping its valuation so ridiculously low at the moment. The Street will start to wake up to it soon.
Lol so green again? Who could have imagined
impressive green. Good for my spy calls, but i just hope my dis puts survive.

This dumbass girl I know who collects almost $2000 a month in Employment Insurance, because Trudeau gives out money to every retard (and have been since March living with mommy and daddy. She somehow lives cheque to cheque spending like a retard). She recently put in $10,000 of welfare/student loan money into GIC lmao. I told her there's better alternatives like ARKW, SP500 and other ETFs that are super low risk with great returns. But she doesn't "want risk with her money." 

GIC only brings in about 2% or something a year. And that's if you agree to have your money tied with the bank for x number of years

When the glut is over and we actually need a supply from the miners it will fucking explode (no pun intended), but I was hearing that run could start in 1 to 2 years. No idea if the legislation will be the start of it though.

From 2000 - 2006 there was a run in uranium, and at the start there were 5 producers. The worst performer went up 20x. The best performer, Paladin, went from $0.015 per share to $10.

Dont get me wrong  i personally use trailing when i do, i meant it more along the lines of the first time you set your stop loss right after acquisition what logic do you use.
if you owe anyone money, and don't pay, eventually they'll sell your debt to a collections agency and yes it will

however with this one simple trick you can make a quick comeback: once it's on your report, call them, and tell them you'll pay today if they take it off your credit report

thank me later when you can still buy and sell goods in the US

Here’s the free part of the article in case it helps:

[The Slack] acquisition could be a harbinger of a new wave of consolidation in the category of enterprise software—companies that sell software and services to other businesses. The Information brainstormed a host of acquisition possibilities for 2021 with investment bankers, investors and tech industry executives. Some possibilities we came up with include Microsoft buying MongoDB, Cisco buying Smartsheet and Oracle or ServiceNow buying Dropbox.

Check "history->options events". If you sold a cash covered put or a credit spread,  and were assigned, RH doesn't always update both sides of the interaction during the weekend. For example, if you are assigned on a cash covered put, the collateral goes missing but the shares don't show up until Monday. Hopefully just a glitch...

Six years later the main lines aren't all replaced, and for a long time the wrecked service lines to each household remained in whatever state each homeowner could afford (thousands are still missing the replacing of theirs, not to mention the pipes *in* each house that remain wrecked, plus all the appliances and fixtures). That take is not nearly detailed enough to give you the whole picture. Tests right at the water treatment plant don't mean much if it then flows through a patchwork of shit pipes.

One can't forget the lasting effects in the population either; lead poisoning cannot be cured and sticks with you the rest of your life, there are other heavy metal poisoning issues as well, and some effects of lead for a mother can carry over to their *grandchildren.* Not to mention for many residents the water smells like ass so no, Flint water is not fine. :(

It seems to be trading sideways atm. which seems like another case of institutional investors keeping the price from going too high so they can keep buying (especially given they have to buy shares due to SP 500). I have been investing in TSLA for two years soon, and it's usually a sign there will be a new jump soon. The 5 billion sales of stocks TSLA did that will go right into investments which will also positively affect the future. The stock will not need to be overvalued for the stock to fall in price, but for people's opinion of it to fall, and I know that Musk will invest everything he has to make TSLA EV cars and green energy a massive success. It might be overvalued in terms of current production, but I bet (and I invest), that it will never get a significantly lower price than currently. In fact when the returns from the new 5 billion investment and their current investments in the battery technology, AI, and factories kick in, the growth will continue exponentially or at very very high rate. It might be the case that all their future good results are factored in the current stock price but I do not think so.

Well I got some good news for you, I don't believe the fed will ever raise rates no matter what they say, like I said before, we saw what happened in 2018, the fed cannot stomach what happens when rates are raised, so they simply won't do it.

They will let inflation run hot and fuk the poor/middle class, they will not tank the market, no chance of it.

Weekend Dow up 0.13%. Futures are going to be blood green!!!!
From my experience, it all depends on the symbol and the amount I invested.

I’m definitely in the hold time of about 5 days but that’s probably because of the time limits on the option contracts but after reviewing my trades I noticed that in some trades if I would of added extra time, 3+ months my life would changed drastically. I’m talking about close to fuck you I quit earnings.

What I’m trying to do now is get smaller but manageable positions for 6+ months and mix a few swing/day trades etc.

Are you using your own TA? I’ve taken this course on edx NYIF and I’ve improved on my entry/exit.

Are you in need of the money? I’m not so desperate for the profits at times and therefore I risk more then what I had to. What I do now is, no matter what I withdraw my weekly payroll no matter what I’ve earned, this kinda got me in a better direction on being satisfied of when I exit trades.
nothing of that stuff matters as long as the printing press keeps printing

If you don't have any CCL calls this week, you might actually be retarded.

With what business model can GME get back on track?  They need to get a larger online presence to compete, we agree there right?  The problem is: Steam already exists, Origin exists, battlenet exists.  You can download games directly from your xbox and PS without ever having to go to a store.  What incentive do any of the big names in the gaming space have to cut GME back in?  Are these companies just going to roll over and allow GME to take market share from them?  

Maybe the omnichannel can save GME, probably not lol.
You are not going have enough deduction to make itemized deduction worth it as Standard deduction has been increased last year. Unless you go down 100 basis points or switch to 15 yr it is not worth refinancing. If you refinanced earlier this year just wait couple  more months we might go lower as economy tanks.

Tell us what you buy so you we can inverse
Sell and don’t look back once you’ve made a reasonable profit. It’s not healthy to think about the what if’s. I personally buy contracts for at least 2 weeks out (preferably months) when the RSI is at or close to oversold so that I can exit my positions during a bounce for a little loss/small profit if I feel uncomfortable about my positions.
I'd cum profusely.

Then how did you decide a nearly 20 year old in the current sense technique was "newer"? It's even older than that just as a concept but those were much different times.

Just about everything you've said about SPACs and their mergers and the historical performance of most of the companies who go in this way has been wrong so I am confused on how you are making these errors other than merely cherry picking.

There have been I think over 100 SPAC mergers this year and we know of about 10 and of course you bring up one of the most successful and well known ones but kind of skip on the other majority. The well documented main reason anyone goes who through a SPAC for the most part is because they can't pass the IPO process and they know it.

The SPAC makes the money no matter what, doesn't care what happens to the company, and is able to "negotiate" the terms of the merger itself to such a high degree that one of the more famous SPACs, Nikola, got in. Well over 70% of these SPACs are just cash grabs by the SPAC merger owner because of the pay structure and how they basically make money most of the time.

SPACs basically a game of diamond in the rough. I have no idea why the underlying here would be that diamond. It's been around for two decades; if it was going to do anything meaningful it would have done it already but the market is ripe for the fleecing so ...

I’m not a WSBer, but fwiw, I’d say about 75% of my positions are currently long term (well the position itself or an exact replacement - I sold VGLT and bought TLT, VNQ for XLRE, etc).

This is NOT the way.
I mean, you are basing that on one trip to 40$. It could break 40’s and go to 60 or it could bounce off 40$ back down to 27 or so. There is a good chance JMIA rises, but you aren’t going to get that information from this chart. This is a very noisy chart.

Get rich quick scheme:

1. Buy an unusual number of calls on a dead but profitable tech company (BB, DBX, WORK).

2. Start a rumor that they are being acquired or have a big deal with a large tech company.

3. Sell your calls and make bank.

4. Fuck the SEC.

2.99% 30-year fixed back in August, which isn't the best but I'm pretty happy with it. Would love to do another refi to \~2.3 - 2.5% 30-year if possible in early 2021.

SPACs are a way to bring very speculative companies to market. There is a reason why they tend to pop during huge bull markets and then tank afterwards. SPACs were also very prevalent before the financial crisis, and then after died off until the late 2010s. 

The poster is absolutely right. That doesn’t mean you can’t make a lot of money off these trades, but inherently the underlying companies are much more risky.

Soo calls on red lobster?
My account is full of future ten baggers
So you were basically thinking it would go from $174 to $200 in just over a month?  

Over the past six months, it has only went up from $124 to $174. Excluding Friday’s jump, which will correct a bit this week, it only went up $30 since June. 

You’re not getting there in a month. Sell it while it’s worth something, and take the small loss, because it will be going down this week, and then leveling off. There isn’t going to be another $21 increase day anytime soon.

Futures need to open up. I wanna watch it shoot up. Bears are so fuk
Their “yields” aren’t even technically worse per chiplet than tsmc/amd... it is because the difference in design. Amd/tsmc use multiple chiplets in their cpus which causes increased latency processing cpu instructions by having to communicate between chiplets, so even with 5nm, their single core processing power will always be worse than intel because of having a non-monolithic design... The benefit is that they can create chiplets with worse yields because even if some of the cores are broken on a chiplet they plan on using multiple anyways to make up the difference, whereas intel needs each chiplet to meet their functional core requirement. If intel ever improves yields for their 7 nm or 5 nm processes in the next few years, their stock will absolutely skyrocket since expectations and PE are currently so low (priced for negative growth, which I absolutely think is incorrect). There is so much less risk and way more upside with intel than amd/tsmc at their current valuations. Not to mention the huge moat intel has in the form of its foundries, massive revenue/profit, government contracts and market share. I would be impressed to see intel fuck up their comeback, and because of that I have been accumulating leaps on intel dips since their last earnings.

The fed reports all hint repeatedly that their intervention was to avert an existential crisis at the cost of fiscal imprudence. Cheeto is effectively done thanks to the the last Supreme Court decision and the Vax is shipping. I imagine it’s a good time to back off propping up the market. That’s not to say it will go red immediately, but the next downward pressure may pop the bubble if the safety net is pulled. 

I think we are still a few weeks out, still worth some hedges though imo.
For that to happen you first should be able to run.

I honestly love RKT. Their app and processes are simple/easy and I've refinanced with them twice this year. There's no question at some point the stock takes off. Just a matter of when.

Yes, Disney+ is gaining on Netflix at breakleg speed. They've gone from 0 to nearly 90 million subscribers in just 1 YEAR. Netflix is only at \~190 mil subs to-date. Disney is now guiding to \~300-350 mil paid subs across its ecosystem by the end of its fiscal 2024, so that'll put it ahead of Netflix (based on NFLX's historical growth rate).

Add the option value of its treasure trove of franchises, vaccine recovery play, and movie theaters back in operations - going long on Disney is a no-brainer at this new breakout level.

>Affirm Holdings Inc. has become the latest company to put off its IPO until the next year.

>What Happened: The Wall Street Journal reported that the fintech startup has decided to postpone its IPO until next year — January at the earliest — according to a source familiar with the matter. It was supposed to go public in the upcoming week.

>The specific reasons are unknown, but the source mentioned delays at the Securities and Exchange Commission caused by the surge in filings and last week’s IPO craze, according to the Journal.

>Why It Matters: The news comes a day after online gaming platform Roblox announced it is delaying its listing until next year for similar reasons.

WSB sentiment didn't get it right the first time. During and after IPO this sub shat hard on PLTR to the point where I nearly dumped all my shares purchased at $9.50. TL;DR: I kept those shares.
Take me back to 2012 so I can pick up mansions for 300k again and load up on lake houses 

My pops bought a lake house in 2012 for 100k when everyone dumped them to keep their main house from foreclosure. Hasn’t put a dollar into it and it’s worth triple that now and my family uses it all summer every summer. Best investment eva
Lol all the people who have publicly YOLOed their million dollar accounts on GME...
I hope  🌈🐻 went ahead and hit the streets this weekend sucking dick so they can at least afford a pack of great value deli ham for Christmas dinner.
Was in a similar situation for about 5 years and put off buying due to my perception of the local market being over valued. Center of a major city, relatively HCOL compared to local suburbs, the housing market just continued to rip during those 5 years. Regret not buying when I could’ve only put 5% down. 

Luckily, we got in at what I viewed a good value in our choice neighborhood. After moving in I look at my home as less of an investment and primarily as a place to live and a hobby project. 
If it greatly appreciates, great, but I’m pretty confident and happy if it gets between 4-7% per year. 

If you’re in a major market, I’d lean towards buying. Can’t go tits up!

Simps be simps for a reason bro
I was contacted about 1-2 months ago to participate in NVAX trials, they contacted me multiple times since trying to get sufficient enrollment. I turned it down ($1300 wasn’t worth my time for the 7 clinic visits and 2 year follow up) I’d guess the trials just got delayed a bit due to insufficient enrollment. The person on the phone told me at the time that the Moderna and 2 other trials in the area already had full enrollment, NVAX was a bit late to the party and they all draw from the same list of applicants so it’s possible they struggled to fill the trial.

I know basically nothing about stocks, I only started investing small on Friday. But it seems to me that Disney should be going up in the next few years once movie theaters open up again, and their parks can handle full capacity. Plus Disney plus seems to be growing
Literally 77% of my portfolio rn. Kinda the reason I can start to even think about this position.
Nah you had your chance.
Nothing extremely bullish about this chart. You just had a huge shift to the green, it’s gonna take some time before you really see any technical trends here. Although, there is a bit of a price channel forming that could show some resistance around 40

You need to give me a straight yes or no answer and I will not judge you no matter what your answer is:

i really like demon slayer
Thats what people have been saying for months
Better returns on small moves
I have shares.  I really appreciate the feedback.  My goal was to exit them in next pull back.  I didn’t know about theta decay in shares.   It’s only a small position of 39 shares.   I watched uvxy dropped to low 10 this year and it spiked a lot afterward.  The third time I pulled the trigger,  obviously it stayed relatively flat.  Only down 100 dollars.   I’m hoping with increase in covid cases and maybe lockdown in Europe, the volatility will increase in short term.  It’s pretty amazing how markets keep going up but it should be interesting in next few months.   Thank you again for explanation.  I think after this I will just keep adding blue chips and indexes and forget about it.  Maybe sell  a few puts  on stocks I’m interested in
Feeling this.

Demon slayer is pretty good ngl. The only anime i’ve ever watched

Before any shitty journalist writes his story and gets a 100$ bonus for after-hours, there's a leak, meaning that the info in question has already been out there for some time and god knows how many people got their hands on it first and traded their knowledge on the markets instead of wasting their time on writing a stupid story for a news website. That's how it's priced in before it's news. In short.

Nevertheless, this is how market treated these companies on Friday:

* FRA: AIR (still has room for a move)
* LON: RR (down)
* NYSE: PFE (down)
* NYSE: HSBC (still has room for a move)
* LON: STAN (down at opening, rebounded by noon)
* NASDAQ: AZN (up)
* NYSE: BA (down)

Boeing, Royce, Airbus. There you go, companies with major defense contracts, congratulations. And how about your PFE vaccines now? Or maybe AZN, its stock has actually risen on Friday after positive news on the likelihood of it's vaccine approval. So what are the chances that chinese commies who worked for the mentioned above companies didn't leak any confidential data to their CCP pimps (and they did, otherwise what else they've been doing)? Do you think they still these products have same revenue potential? Right.

I'm not surprised with HSBC tho, they've been laundering money for a lot of shady schmuks like russkies mafia members, chinese and various Latin America drug cartels (google it if you're still unaware).

On tsla you will likely have the stock called in early by some boomer after there broker starts calling them about tax lost harvesting into new year and they want to rip an extra commission on something in the news

I don’t care if it actually goes ITM as long as I can break even at some point, although a profit would be nice. I didn’t buy at the top, I bought last week when it was already down. 

Plus stock price only has to go up 28.6% to be ITM and that’s less % than I’ve already lost (33.79%) so it’s basically free money. 

^(help me I’m scared)

My favourite spread is the diagonal spread, just buy an ITM/ATM call a month or two out and then sell an OTM weekly. Slightly less retarded way to YOLO - protects downside and leaves a good bit of upside depending on how OTM the strike is

Eg for my current play, I bought a Jan 22 620c for around $8k and sold a Dec 18 660c for $3k for a net debit of $5k. I can keep doing this and eventually pay off the 620c and just let it ride.

If TSLA drops below 620 it doesn't matter because I've already reduced how much I paid for the 620c by $3k. If it goes to 660 then I'll just close the spread for a net profit. 

Rinse and repeat, sell weeklies for $2-3k until I've made enough to cover the initial 620c purchase. Wait the TSLA to moon

dude you might get rich, like seriously, buy some calls too
Idk about that, buying and holding vs trying to beat the market still definitely holds up. Applying it to options is a little more nuanced but I don't see why it wouldn't work.

The reason why I'm so bullish is that Disney valuation as SOTP (sum of the parts) is STILL significantly undervalued, especially when taking into account the growth rate possible for its direct-to-consumer business.

Savage is throwing money away on a shit company with shit financials cuz you saw a shit article about them signing a deal with Amazon. There's a million other better plays out there.
Look into volatility and how it affects the premium on options (e.g. IV crush). Pretty significant information to have if you're playing options. Check out tastytrade.

Think of that as price signaling though; not only do you get to dodge scrutiny but you also don't have the power to pay the costs meaning that, at least in my mind, you don't have what it takes to be properly listed.

I am not saying that all SPACs are bad but historically most have been for this very reason; the companies merged in just aren't what you need for them to work out.
I sold it for profit three days before launch because a reliable reviewer i follow didnt get his review code and was complaining about poor communication. Im gonna buy in again heavily discounted soon, because i believe in cdpr long term.

Right now, it's idiocy to be a bear. Greatest bull market in history. Last month has been a 12% rally. Congress is about to release stimulus and bought themselves a week to specifically negotiate it. They recognize that jobless claims are becoming an issue and all answer to the same corporate donors that are demanding corporate welfare. The political will is developing before your eyes and you think we are going to have a downturn? What exactly are you predicting is going to happen?? Where do you think people are going to put their money?

The road can only be so long.
Yeah assuming you have the freezer space and enough people to feed it works out really well.  Normally do a pig every year and did a quarter cow not too long ago.  

Like this time around I might not go a full cow because not sure if we will go through it fast enough.  Crazy how cheap groceries get when you don’t have to buy meat.

Made good money on puts last week but missed a 44 bagger in QCOM puts Thurs into Fri(sold at 6 bagger). Currently in GME and XPEV calls. GME and XPEV are purely technical plays bought Friday near the close. Looking at SNAP, ETSY, CVNA and ALLY puts for this week. Gotta see if I get my entry signal.
Totally agree. It's current price makes no sense to me but I can't help but think it's gonna get one more run in the not too distant future.

The moratorium for Fannie and Freddie has been extended to end of January. It may be extended again. Not sure how it will effect things when it all comes down. Banks will be fine this time around. Fed has/will make sure of that. Just a bunch of houses for cheap that will be picked up by investment companies and rented out or maybe house prices come down some? Maybe get some cheap rentals if you have some cash.

Wait I actually never even thought about golf betting before. Does it work like boxing where you try to guess what round it will end with (like a 5th round knockout is worth 12:1, where winning by points is only 2:1 or whatever). So with golf its like if Woods gets a birdy on the 3rd hole you win 6:1 odds? Also since golf is a "rich man's sport", is there a lot of money involved compared to other sports betting?

I think it’s all about risk tolerance. For warrants fair value is hard to calculate, you can use black scholes. The problem with warrants is they can be redeemed. The best part of these warrants is I believe that they can be redeemed on 8/21 at the earliest. So even if they hit the redemption price they still have tons of time to run up. Each warrant agreement is a little different.

I agree. We hit the first selloff after the lemon report!

Time to buy every dip and strap in for the rocket to actually lift off.

There is not even media attention anywhere outside business news yet. Once it doubles again, there might be. Once PLTR gets it´s first 1B contract with the DoD it might be. 

That is when the rocket will lift off. I estimate around 12 months until we hit 100. and 350 by 2023. Then we can talk about a bubble. But then the fundamentals will look so shiny like the crab in moana.

Chill! u won't be taxed on the gains u made in 2021, **if** u got them before filing taxes ( Jan - Feb). If u made the 6k later, u will be taxed. The good thing is, you can cover your taxes with the loss for couple of years.

Y r u fucked if u don't have 6k????? Also if u really want to make good risky position if u don't mind the possible loss then go for tesla! Wait for it to have a red day of going down by i don't know 3 or more percent than buy the most expensive option that u can afford that only needs a little boost up to go green and boom u got 1 to 3k in ur bank extra. Thats what I did I waited and waited and waited until it went red bought at 2pm (an hour before market closes and sold the next trading day earning me a solid 3k) fyi this is nowhere near a guaranteed payoff but its the best option that I can think of for u. If u want a less risky option go get a 3 to 5k loan and b done with robinhood until u get ur shit together.

You can deduct capital loses from taxable income up to $1,500 (if single) and 3,000 if married.  The rest of the loses can be carried forward and deducted next year and so on.  This is assuming you don’t have any capital gains elsewhere.  So NO you do not need to rush to try to recoup loses before the end of the year

You hold shares in UVXY? or calls on UVXY? you gotta realise that we're talking about theta decay in the underlying. If you have shares in UVXY you are exposed to theta decay in the vix index. Look up how vix is constructed. It's a strip of puts and calls near the money on the sp500. The UVXY product probably rolls vix futures at each daily rebalance, selling front month and buying second month futures. Unsure if exactly that, but other vix products do this. Every day it rebalances you are losing theta as the vix futures term structure is in contango 80% of the time. That means the second month costs more than the front month. Unless there is a huge spike the theta decay will bring the share value to zero eventually. It's not meant as a long term instrument, only short term.

Which one of you autists did this?
For shares I think we should be able to hit 120 easily. For options I’m looking to double well before March and then I’ll pull out half. With the way the market is behaving, I think we will see 120 by February or earlier. Inauguration is near the end of January, Biden will most likely hint at or start pulling back sanctions fairly quickly after taking power. 

US share holders only account for about 17% of CNOOC shares. This has dipped 30% since the announcement.
NET 200 end of Q1

Works out be like 800 lbs of beef for like $2300-$2500.  Hamburger here at the store runs like $3.5 a pound and that’s the cheapest cut that you end up with buying the animal.  A good 16 oz.  ribeye costs like $10-$15 each in the store.  Will save at least as much as what I am paying over the the year.

You must be new here. Go back test your little theory that Sunday futures is predictive of Monday open. Low volume pajama traders in a high volatility environment.

3. Trump wins electoral College in controversial fashion.

Based on some technical analysis with the fib retracement and trend lines i cam see TSLA going through another consolidation period 3 months before loading up to hit 8-900 PT but the dilution you mentioned will be interesting in the long run. Also well have to see how it acts in the s&p theyre entering a whole new ballgame now. I have MESH21 contracts just to see what happens when they do enter.

Their stores don't work that well, they're closing them down and making big changes. But it looks like they're climbing up the slide and going down the ladder. The only bullish thing I see about this is that they have the balls to make a big move like this. It shows they're becoming far less boomer-like. However, it doesn't mean their next big move is going to generate as much revenue as their stores did 10 years ago. They're juggling mashed potatoes and they know it.

That sounds pretty bullish to me. No more forbearance means money is coming in again plus I’ll repeat myself. No one is expecting this to pass and it hasn’t passed for months while we just keep mooning
Blah blah, buy calls. Already did grandpa
Still gonna pump. Come back tomorrow.

I can remember going into a JCPenny back when I was younger and it was like a mortuary. It was just dead silent with no one in it, with all the merchandise neatly arranged like it was on display in a museum. I swear to god I didn't want to touch anything because it all looked so neat and put in place...like an art display.

JCP had interest payments of 300 million a year and cash of 300 million. They had no buffer, at all, for COVID.

GME veered real close as well. IF things were just a little bit different GME would be facing bankruptcy this quarter or next. But the console refresh came at just the right moment to prevent that. Shorts played a dangerous game and they lost, at least for the next few years. If, in that time, GME can use this reprieve to durably put the business on a sustainable course...there will eventually be a short squeeze, there would have to be.

Sorry I’m just trying to make some money. There’s nothing more American or capitalistic than selling out to the communists.

Look at the adoption of Mandarin in Africa.
Once options are available, you will know the truth about this shitty stock. DASH too.
Honestly, get rich or lose $10k trying. Not bad.

Can they deposit my stimmy directly into Robinhood? Save me the extra step? So it can be vaporized on $TSLA calls immediately instead of three days later?
Hope you're selling covered calls.

Just if anyone is curious, the long run quote and how we remember it is a result of a right wing hit job. Actual quote:

“In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean is flat again.”

Basically he said we shouldnt focus on how studying how things work in the long run and ignore what causes short term pain.
What of it? So do most countries.

PLTR will rocket tomorrow then slowly bleed until Friday to burn out your Friday options as if to ask you “do you never learn?”

I couldn’t agree more. The chart looks atrocious, there could be more dip buying this next week but if the premarket Monday closes below 65 I’m gonna be shorting tf out it on a day to day basis.
I bet those people doing straddles would make money and maybe hedge it with an iron condor on spy or leveraged etf. Idk how to do that tho so im talking out of my ass.

Roughly half the worlds population doesnt gave access to the internet. This could be paradigm changing for the world. Imagine how many more scientists and leaders will be made overnight simply by having access to information. If we think innovation is happening fast now, wait until 3 billion more people gain access to education and everything else, for better or for worse, that the internet brings.

Just LOL at putting this in Tesla and not PLTR which will 10x from here.

Tesla is priced in for years.
Stimulus has been rejected for months and we have steadily climbed. Why would it dump now lol no one is expecting it to pass and the only big movement will be is if it passes and we moon
u/amputatorbot
Exactly. And the technology will be timeless.
I guess it depends if you think the value of something is what most people can afford or if the value is what people are willing to pay. Obviously a condo in Toronto holds more value than a condo in Wyoming. Bc it’s a more desirable place to live, and supply is low compared to the amount of people wanting to live there so the objective value goes up w demand right? Supply and demand is rly what decides the actual value of anything I think. People are only forced to pay more bc other people are willing/able to pay it. But good point about debt, these days it’s not about what people are able to pay, but how much debt they’re willing to take on
Why would investors invest millions in a company just because they move another index, didn't make any growth for months and have strong competition?

Buttfuck Sluts Go Nuts Vol 7
Shit didn’t even see the launch got aborted Lol makes me happier now I sold my dec 18 27 strike for 60% profit now
Semiconductors are exactly 0% of ASML's revenue stream. They only make EUV fabrication machines. And EUV is only used for 5nm and below by TSMC. That new PS5 you bought for your wife's boyfriend? Yeah, thats 7nm, not EUV. ASML had nothing to do with that.

Yes, ASML certainly does profit from TSMC, but 5nm is not in production yet (they are in risk production though).

Also, creating fabrication machines is a whole different ball game from actually manufacture semiconductors for other clients.

Does GE Aviation "hold all the cards" for the airline industry? Does AMD "hold all the cards" for game consoles? Of course not. Yes they are a critical supplier but they ONLY make EUV machines, nothing more.

I originally bought 100 $18 Jan 2022 for $50K, then subsequently bought ~50 more of these contracts throughout last month while they were dirt cheap. I sold those ~50 contracts Friday, and now I’m sitting on the original 100 contracts and about $14K profit. 

I plan on buying TSLA after it crashes, whenever that is.
See comment below
I’d consider tweeting at Cohen too. This management is as shortsighted as it comes. We need World class e-commerce infrastructure NOW not two years from now. Disgraceful they risk people’s health for this when there is an obvious better way for the vast majority of their products.

I doubt it goes lower than $300 a share anytime soon but a long dated put could be easy money
That’s like saying the consumers who suddenly found themselves broke made up of the majority of consumer behavior. Not the case at all. There’s a reason FANGMAN did better, along with all the companies that make up the future economy, than before covid. 

More importantly, the market doesn’t dip after the bottom. It dips before the bottom. The last bottom was an overreaction. Facebook isn’t going to dump 40% because cases are rising or evictions are rising. There’s no significant correlation. 

You have to actually connect the dots between your thesis and reality. I don’t see you doing that. Now if you said the market it just overvalued, I’d be right there with you, and we’d be talking about whether it’s justified by the free money environment and lack of incentive to invest in fixed income, which I think can only last so long. I don’t see another crash for two years at least. Of course what the fuck do I know, as on the end it’s all about market psychology. But it won’t be because of the economy writ large. How many times do you have to hear that the market isn’t the economy?

This didn't stop the massive +300 in 3 day bump Tesla got after they RE-ANNOUNCED that they were being added into the S&P 500 at some point, which was 10x bigger than the INITIAL announcement where they said they were adding Tesla to the S&P 500. 

Sure the information may not be brand new, but it does reiterate the profits, expense savings, and that the S&p 500 inclusion is next week(this week) and what Tesla is repolacing, and likely a lot of people and firms may by ahed of Friday anyway.

Reasons it could potentially go red

I'm enjoying that documentary so far. Jordans been so iconic during my life that its very interesting to see him a bit behind the scenes and catch a glimpse of him as he matured. For a sports documentary, it does feel a bit superficial at times, like the only way its allowed to exist is if it presents a fawning portrait of the guy. There are definitely parts where he messes with the GM but I feel like thats a pretty nerfed criticism.

GME brother. Take a look around these interwebs and think about what is likely to happen here in the next few months. Could turn a little into a lot. Nothing is without risk of course, but if you’re willing to actually buy Airbnb, you already seem like you have a high risk tolerance. Far out calls on GME or shares to hit the possible squeeze that’s likely to come at some point.

Might be worthwhile to close out the trade on Friday to avoid any pin costs.
(somewhere on WSB - there is an example of someone with a credit spread that cost them $40K from pin cost) for example UPS closes in between your spreads such that some of your options are in the money, but not both.  You could end up having one of the options you sold get exercised, but not the ones you bought.  If UPS then does some wild swing after hours - you will be on the hook for the difference.  $350 loss is not too bad.
Why?

Also NIO is probably not going to moon, they will announce the secondary offering pricing this week which will drag it and XPEV/LI down with it most likely.
So the bust around 2001 was just because of 9/11?

Absolutely. Trust in Cathie Wood, her ARK funds added a few mil in shares over the last few weeks
blockbuster lmfao.
could 100% be possible. Look at FMTX, often times early investors make a diluted secondary offering at maybe 5-10% discount of market price 1-2 days before lockup. In this case maybe a later announcement- they can choose to do so Monday or any day after
There’s some solid DD here about how NVAX might end up with the best vaccine. Their UK trial should have efficacy readouts in January, but early trials showed them having the strongest immune response and milder injection side effects. Sterilizing immunity so the virus can’t replicate, which I don’t think the others were able to get. 

It can also potentially be combined with their new flu shot, which doesn’t sound possible with the other vaccines, and it only requires normal fridge temps for storage. They’re slept on because they are a month or so behind the others, and quietly have the 2nd most orders (behind AZN) worldwide.

So not being first to market kinda hurts but vaccinating the masses will be a long enough timeline that should NVAX hit above 90% efficacy and provide sterilizing immunity, it’ll be the heavy hitter for vaccinations going forward.
is anyone around here scared?
Hope the UK gets fucking wrecked by Brexit.

There's always a data pipeline that goes from the clients datastore to Palantirs plug in. This data pipeline will always require custom logic so that the data is in the correct format when it arrives to Palantirs systems. They even say themselves that this is the hardest part of their job in their S-1

> Implementing our platforms can be a complex and lengthy process since we often configure our existing platforms for a customer’s unique environment

It's also funny that you say this

>It's not really "custom". But if that's what you call "custom software" then hit me up sometime and I'll bill you for some custom software

Because billable hours is literally how Palantir charges for it's Forward Deployed Engineers. Also don't knock CRUD and data engineering, a lot of people make a ton of money from doing consulting for it.

Mango going to veto said defense bill.
Novavax is a fucking cool name. There's also something to be said for not desperately trying to be first out of the door and for planning for scale when we're going to see literally billions of doses of vaccines administered in the coming year/s and potentially billions of doses every year FOREVER. If novavax can create a billion doses by the summer of 2021 that makes them a far bigger player than moderna and/or Pfizer/biontech.

Nothing about what you have mentioned is NEW information. Sure, we may see some rise in price, but people have known about S&P and all that for quite a while.

I’d say it’s that you can sprinkle a seasoning on food and eat it 

If you sprinkle a bouillon cube on food it wouldn’t be too tasty. Since you have to prepare it, I would say it’s an ingredient 

But I suppose I could be wrong here. Thought this was a more 1 sided issue...

Is there a single TA tool that has a predictive accuracy of 55% or more when back tested?
fuck yes. join us. you can sell a credit call spread if you want, that limits your downside. but fuck it, you're committed to gambling 8.5 regardless, so just yolo FDs
that was last week fam. We BUYING SHIT UP THIS WEEK
I figured that by the end of this week or next that the vaccine would be emergency approved, so I managed to snag 3 $PFE 12/24 calls on Friday at strike price of 42. I’m waiting for my steak dinner on Monday lmao
Oh yeah lmao glad we don’t have that problem
used to be a nerd but then i started buying calls.
That would give it a similar market cap to IBM while doing 1/77th the revenue...
Damn that Hawaiian guy bought 200K worth SPCE weekly and now he's begging them to flying again this week. Now that's a true WSB retard right there.

I think people are jittery that the ride is ending. Just one small spark can start a wave of selling. The vaccine is coming, media outlets left and right calling tech, IPO a bubble. When are people going to start taking profits? My bet is the first week of Jan.

Bullish
`Did you say SLV, or GLD?' said the Call.

`I said SLV ,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep appreciating and depreciating so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'

`All right,' said the Call; and this time it lost value quite slowly, beginning with the dollars, and ending with the cents, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

`Well! I've often seen a Call without any cents,' thought Alice; `but cents without a Call! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'
wtf 405 lb bench thats like top 1%
Do you think it still has room to go up?
Youre retarded cuz youre tech aint bleeding
Wth was your strike price ??
Daily looking weak as fuck, if we don’t get a limit up for no reason we’re definitely looking dumpy
or you could've done what most people here probably did, read the DD, buy the top of the swing, and sell when citron shorted it

you're good man, don't buy at the top of a swing, average in and hold, don't be a pussy and sell when the bears come out
You can make your money back in just over a year selling 4 calls with your shares. Easy cash this guy is onto something

Yeah how do 99% of the fucking retards on here completely fail to understand this? There’s a reason there were no significant concerns about liquidity during S&P500 inclusion...I would bet good money that the whole trade is already completely planned out. Plenty of hedge funds and managed funds most likely took massive delta-hedged positions when inclusion was announced, enjoyed playing retail for some sick premium for a few weeks, but have every intention of dumping those shares onto the index funds at, well...significantly less than $800/share or whatever the retards here are hoping for. Index funds are massive cash cows for the big bois, they’re not gonna fuck them up be being forced to buy Tesla on a retardedly high 1-day spike that will collapse the next day.

This is a MM hack job article. They're trying to drive the stock down so they can get out of their shorts. It keeps saying that they've been driven "further into debt" but they actually have more cash on hand than they have short term debt and long term debt combined. They also have 900M in inventory.

They bought it under a trust fund. The reasoning behind that is either because they’re trying to hide their taxes, or they don’t want people to know they own the property. I was talking to a city clerk who highly recommended putting my house under some kind of trust so people can’t link my house to me for marketing and scamming purposes.

A devalue in the yuan will have a chain reaction causing other nations to devalue local currency, which will cause the dollar to rise.

I realize which is why I will hold through merger but in this market it's hard to tell where things will go. If it ends up generating Square levels of excitement and growth I'll keep it. Same theory with PSTH. I may not hold it for years but if they land Stripe I'll probably hold it until i retire in 20 years.

They’ve been unprofitable for a decade. They’re going to continue to be unprofitable. These little gov contracts mean nothing. Price is being shot up retards and hedge fund managers who are going to let them hold their bags.

Q.  Why do you think pltr is going up this week into the 35 range?  I know stonncks go up.   But really  why?  Pltr 12/31 25c, 2/19 25c, 1000 shares.

I know I'm gonna get downvoted like hell for saying this because no Gamestop slander is allowed on this sub, but don't people just buy games on the Xbox Store, Playstation Store or Steam? I'm not a hardcore gamer by any stretch, I buy maybe 1-2 games a year max, but I haven't stepped inside a GameStop in years. Just no need for it. I download all my games directly on the console. I just don't get how Gamestop can become the Amazon of gaming. Amazon is more likely to become the Amazon of gaming imo.

Just not really seeing the need for an online game store. We already have them. Maybe I'm missing something here. I'd actually love to be proven wrong on this. I want to make money like everyone else lol. Just not seeing it with GME though.

I have been a degenerate sports gambler for the last decade.

Eith all that said, i havent bet nor had the urge to bet a single game in the last year since I "invested" in the market and learned how to trade options. Makes blackjack and sports booking seem like bingo at the old folks home.
I just but VTSAX in my boomer account. If I were to buy shares they would be J&J, Proctor & Gamble, JPM Chase.

It'll be a confusing open to a pump where we re-establish our zones, our bottom test will probably be 372 with our top tests being around 375-376.
Profiting off of capitalism is a weird way to word the complete siphoning of funds from people who need them in order to make mega corporations even more profitable than they already area while millions of Americans continue to go hungry and wonder how much they’ll be getting in unemployment next week

Let’s just be honest and say everyone here is trying to take advantage of wage slavery while America burns from the ground up. It’s shameful to word it any other way.

That's what reading and writing for several hours a day for months on end does for an investment, it is also the reason uranium is roughly half my total investment portfolio.

The norm in a uranium bull marker could be 25%-30% a day for a week, it could also go down by that same amount during corrections. If you can handle the volatility and have the right conviction, this sector can provide life changing returns.

What new contracts did PLTR announce this weekend? (If any)
I get where you're coming from in the sense that you are comparing Palantir to data viz tools like Tableau. But the important notion about Palantir's tools in my opinion is that they aren't just a data integration/aggregation tool. They have functionalities that make them different. Some specifics on these functionalities could be like customizable visualization dashboards (common idea but seems to be deeply customizable), varying ways of exporting the data, ability to build complex apps with the transformed data, etc. That's actually the reason why they have two different products (Gotham and Foundry) so they build these functionalities that can be generalized in terms of government vs enterprise. Their focus on hiring consulting engineers (aka forward deployed engineers) may have helped them gather the complex requirements and implement them into their SaaS products, allowing them to build towards a fully automated SaaS.

I think this edge should put the company ahead of other competitors by a lot. Although the video is pretty useless, might have been better to examine the case studies

 GME is under going what is called "digital transformation"

think of what Blockbuster SHOULD have done.  If they execute it correctly this bitch is going to the fucking moon. 

Best Case scenario - Board and management take Cohen up on his demands/advice. GME becomes the W or CHWY of gaming. A CATEGORY KILLER. You would be looking at a 20 bagger in a few years. #ecommerce, #gaming,
how can you seriously believe tomorrow will be red

Yeah but unlike doordash PLTR will be 150 and beyond in a couple years

Congrats on the $$! Did you see the news w/Royalty Pharma and Athyrium?
In for $50k. I expect this “shout out” to give it a nice 20% bump and then for it to have up and down 5% days, with a steady rise until they finalize the deal. I doubt it goes above $20 until the deal is 100% (it’s still pending at the moment). When they announce it’s finalized I bet it pumps to $25 very quickly  and then a slow and steady climb to $35 by YE 2021. I’ll sell 50% at $20, 25% at $25 and hold the rest until YE.
PLTR is ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS COMING WEEK.

$200 ON DECK.
That’s accepting mediocrity and not having the willpower or discipline to change. They’re not staying that way bc they’re happy like that. They’re just resigning and deluding themselves to it

You guys have no clue what's in store for INTC stock. I work in semis. I am accumulating this stock on each dip. 

1- process nodes are just numbers for marketing.  INTC 10nm process has more transistor density than TSMC 5nm. This is because of INTC's super finfet technology. Power and performance will always be better for INTC. 

2- supply and demand.  Competitors are struggling to meet the demand on 7nm and 5nm as they have to rely on TSMC. INTC on other hand has in house FABs and can meet the excessive demand. Based on inventory shortages only,  INTC will go to $60+  before Jan 2021.

3- history.  INTC has been there and done it. AMD was gonna eat INTC for lunch in 2000s, IBM in 1990s,  QCOM in 2010s and AAPL in 2020s. INTC is still here and will be relevant for decades to come. 

4- Autonomous driving:  MOBILEEYE, acquired  by INTC , has 10+ major auto makers signed up.  If you retarded morons think TSLA will be only relevant players in this technology,  you have no fucking idea.

TLDR because anyone buying an IPO in this market is asking to get fucked. SPAC warrants are where you want to be with speculative money, NOT IPOs. You're bag-holding for institutional buyers who get to pump the price before the stock starts trading publicly.

The only one it *might* be too late on is ARKG, however with the vaccine news this weekend it might get another big pop this week. 

To be honest I feel like there isn’t really a *wrong* time to buy into ARK. Just wait for a decent red day and buy some leaps. I haven’t bought monthlies or weeklies for ARK so i can’t speak on their performance, but leaps are doing me very well.

If I can help one other a neuro typical individual realize they are valid and that someone is willing to fight for them it's all worth it so I thank you greatly for the advice but I have to take the brunt of there force there words cant hurt me anymore.

Yes, look into the strategy "Poor man's covered call" or PMCC. It is a way to reduce your cost and still profit with a large runup. You could sell the 40c and it would be pretty safe.

It's worse than weird. It's the sort of shitshow you get when you combine corruption, laziness, and automation.

Also, read up on the U.S. standard of evidence for tax court. It basically amounts to "the government only has to prove there might be a violation here" for you to lose.

When facing the IRS, the trick is to hit them with a wall of evidence. Like a legit WSB-style DD post wall of evidence.

Dafuq is dat
This was me when my ~80$ worth of CLF 14c 12/24's was worth 275$ on Thursday. Only worth about 170$ on Friday since it bounced back down to about 13.50. Still got another two weeks until expiry so more than enough time for it to go back up, but goddamn, it sucks knowing I didn't sell and take the immediate bag and dip out.  

I think in the future if I ever get in a scenario where selling one call will more than pay for the initial investment in all calls, ima do that, but then hold the rest for a bit and see how it goes. First time really fucking with stocks at all. It was neat to see 100$ turn into almost 300$ because green line go up hehe, but then green line turn red and number go down and I have the big sad.  

Maybe green line go back up tomorrow or this week and I make many money. That would be cool.
Do you think PLTR has priced in Tiberius already or are we going to see a bump because of all the PR coming out for it?

Just saying, if you think that was a dip your in for a rude awakening one day.
It’s so easy a 🌈🐻 can do it
What’s that mean? I bought in at 50 and made $400 on it Friday, should I sell?
I mean I don't doubt it. As long as rates are down, both us and chinese investors are going to flood  the market with their cash because theres nowhere else to put it. House prices are at a record high due to low mortgage rates, no ones in RE and those who sold their houses made a killing and probably opened a RH account to fomo in, and we have stimulus and vaccines to look forward to, plus improving job numbers at some point. I think we are going to run hard for another year or two, or at least I hope.

Definitely tough to say where the price is going to land upon mrtp approval, but management has a plan to put product on the shelves within 90 days of the green light. All signs are pointing to this being on the verge of takeoff, especially with volume being 10 times the average on Friday and the ceo speaking at a conference tomorrow
are you also fat?
DIS, after a dip.
It almost feels like too much of a slam dunk, there has to be a catch here.
I held TSMC for a bit but didn't like the international trade issues so I sold. Also held ASML and sold because we have approached near theoretical limitations for the products they build. Instead shifted all those returns into consumer facing semiconductor companies AMD, NVIDIA, APPLE instead. 

I project these companies have more room for growth and or to pivot than TSMC or ASML. At least that's my long term perspective.

I showed up at this girls house one time cause she said she didn’t feel like going out anymore and wanted to order sushi and chill at her place instead. So I’m like dope food and head is on the menu tonight. 

I go to her place and she lives on top of a restaurant. Now this is San Francisco so the apartments are down a long hallway. I’m getting weird vibes thinking what am I gunna do if this is a set up and I gotta run down this hallway (A lot of people get set up and robbed on Tinder out here)

This fat troll bitch opens the door and I’m like oh god I hope her sister got the good genes. Nope, it was her, complete catfish. So I start running the options through my head. Do I turn and run away? Do I make an excuse and say I left something in the car? Then I looked in and saw the sushi on the table and said fuck it Ima eat that. 

Texted my roommate to call me in 15 min. He calls me and as soon as I hang up this bitch says “You’re leaving now aren’t you?” Not in a sad tone. Bitch said it like she was mad and has done this shit before. 

I walked away from that door so fast, no hug, no I’ll hit you up, just right the fuck out and didn’t look back. 

Sushi was mediocre

Could go up to 1200 this week or the selling could just start in the morning. I have no idea but my suspicion is that the people who will be selling to funds during the closing cross may have been buying since Q2. We might not see the volume this week that literally everyone is expecting.

Couldn’t be more wrong about this being a pump and dump. They’re in the final stages of FDA approval for MRTP status, which should literally be days to weeks away (with a plan to have product on the shelves within 90 days of approval). They have a new ceo as of about 6 months ago, who has lined up almost monthly conferences at this point to get word out. Leaps and bounds better than previous management, and they’re foregoing bonuses during this time too. Where the company is now is not where it was in 2017 by ANY means, and I’d encourage you to take another look at this one
It was supposed to be mid December, but now it’s gunna be early next year.. they announced the delay yesterday
Same here!
Tech up because of last week’s correction? Or even stronger correction this week on vaccine news? Stay tuned.

It’s not shoe shine boy thinking for liking SPCE, it’s shoe shine boy thinking for believing that it’s an easy way to get rich.

SPCE $60 2022 calls(only 13 months away) are trading at $7.15. If you want to 10x your investment, you’re looking at SPCE needing to hit 131 in 13 months(or something  like 100 in 6 months if you sell).

Could SPCE hit 100 in the next 6 months? Sure. Is it an easy get rich quick scheme? Hell no.
Ouff it seems you need some help or to find peace in life. I hope one day you find peace.

SPCE: You like that you fuckin' retard
Fair point. The thing with SPACs is the deal is designed to give them a share value of $10. Whatever numbers they used to work out the deal, the end result is always (almost) supposed to be $10. Whether its Draftkings, Utz, Nikola, or Hall of Fame village, they're all supposed to be equal to $10, however the market obviously values them all differently.

As far as the warrants go, they always behave in this way. A SPAC trading under \~$14 usually values warrants higher than the share price would indicate due to the five years of theta baked in. SPACs trading higher than \~$14 typically value the warrants lower than share price -$11.50 because they can't be exercised yet, and given that they were 'supposed' to be worth $10, there is an implied risk the price could fall.

These are all very normal things in the SPAC world, and while Chargepoint might have room to fall, neither of those issues are indicators that it will.
Don't be so sure.  VLDR had an epic PIPE dump which sent HYLN down, too.

Here’s my contribution. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Everything sounds like easy money in retrospect.
Think it’s too late to get in now?
Its gonna have billions in buying pressure but people are gonna take profits. Its gonna be volatile as hell.
FYI we havent even hit 40 p/e ratio on the SPY. The dotcom bubble was over 40 and that was with people throwing millions at geocities websites, vs now we have nothing else to invest in except stonks due to fed rates, and the tech is real this time.

This was a problem before.  Real Estate "investment" and side gig landlords have been rising prices for ages.

Incumbent investors are just mad that ABNB is crowding in on their turf and spinning this talking point.  Hotel conglomerates are more than happy to dogpile.
Have you tried changing the direction for the buy-order? Typically during this time of year, East to West works better.

I think they want the exact same shares back - I happen to have them and am willing to sell them back at a modest $40, they really were the best PLTR shares

Glad to know I have gotten a name on here, been called "that one uranium guy" more times than I can recall, which I will hold with pride.

Personally I would definitely be looking at Denison at these prices, but even after this run up the companies in the sector are still very cheap. Having said that, a pullback will be healthy to establish a higher base, so you might be able to get a few percent off.

Reason Energy Fuels has preformed so well is the combination of them being a uranium company and also benefitting from positive legislation from the US government and their diversification into REE's.

Losing money tomorrow should distract you.
From what I saw, Etsy steadily rose then dipped a bit at 10am at the incluson date (21st of September) and after inclusion it kept rising days after. I couldn't find the specific volume of shares moved at 4pm. At 3pm it spiked but 4pm idk. (Have to pay for an actual service for that historical data and im being cheap rn). If your on robinhood, good luck. They dont allow option trading after 4pm from my research. So if it spikes at 4pm, might be screwed.

Ok man, welcome home, you belong.  Now let’s get them rookie numbers working toward that -100% or that +200000%.
That was the trade last week. Im ahead of you
F
Luckily, I'm not retarded enough to have paid $2350 for this trade. I received at least $1350 credit which is the settled cash that is not contributing to my current buying power. 

So essentially if i let this spread expire, I should expect $1000 of my settled cash to be removed from account leaving me with $350?

I'll have to take a better look through my account statement, but I think overall this trade wasn't completely terrible since I was receiving credit for each roll out. I'll get back to this once I get a chance to calculate the total cost basis of this UPS trade.

It could be the out of the money short leg of a call debit spread (bullish). Buy the $40c, sell the $44c. 

Or the out of the money long leg of a call credit spread (bearish). Well the $40c, buy the $44c. 

Or, someone fat fingered the order from 2 to 2,000 contracts.

If u have the cash OTM put is the way to go.  Theta gang makes $ plus tsla will most likely rally through sp500 inclusion.    Take premium then buy to close if tsla jumps big.   Or if u buy the stock then sell covered call.  Good luck

QuantumScape (QS) is ripe for at least one bad catalyst between Monday and December 21, and maybe the rest of December. The catalyst(s) will end the blockbuster event re. the share price, and will in turn affect other EV SPAC prices.

What catalyst could it be? Another competitor's update on solid-state batteries (not just Toyota)? Short seller "research" tweets like the one against LAZR? Bearish price targets after initial analyst coverage, like the HYLN coverage by GS and JPM? NKLA PIPE dump on December 21 itself?

What about what the OP said?

And yet that's exactly what launched the +100 per day 3 day in a row spike last time. In fact, the news was lesser, her we have the replacement, news of production savings, and Texas company savings. That thing from last time was barely news and everyone freaked out.
Shut up you!

TSM gang checking in. 

About 3 months ago bought TSM 95c expiring in april, up bigly, wish I had bought more. Gonna hold TSM for a long time.
I’ve been scaling up off-and-on over the past few months before the original run-up to $3.75 a warrant months ago. I went in much harder recently when warrants dipped down to the $1.30 range. I’m sitting at a little over 76k warrants with an average cost basis around $1.80. I could see another $4 pump from the current $5.80 price just in the next week or two. That doesn’t even include the pending Q1 partnership announcements.
as in sell short dated but further OTM options against my LEAPs?

Holy shit - so rare that someone knows what begging the question is. 

What it is: why are u so fucking retarded?? (inserting unfounded premise, ie that you’re retarded, and then asking you to explain said unfounded premise.)

What it isn’t: PE ratios are meaningless these days, which begs the question, are we investing or gambling?

I got TESLA 650c that expires 12/18 wondering if I should hold or roll.

Sounds like they need more cocaine at the Tesla factory.
Puts on high IV plays is super risky.   Options with high IV won't really budge until you get close to ITM. You are still 30% from ITM and so any decrease in IV till fuck ya even more.  My guess is you bought them at 300% IV or some shit.  If IV >200%, do a put spread.  You probably could have bought a 30/20 put spread for the same price when you bought it and banked.
Like I said in my comment which you didnt comprehend he says in the replies that he made the gains with options you daft retarded fuck.

I literally said it doesnt look like he played with options here as a contradiction to his other reply, and yes I would not be surprised if someone put 600k in options, look what sub you're on you dumb fuck lol.

We stood up for what was right. We fought for moral reason. We passed laws, struck down laws, for moral reason. We waged wars on poverty, not on poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors, we put our money where our mouths were and we never beat our chest. We built great, big things, made ungodly technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases and we cultivated the world’s greatest artists AND the world’s greatest economy. We reached for the stars, acted like men. We aspired to intelligence, we didn’t belittle it. It didn’t make us feel inferior. We didn’t identify ourselves by who we voted for in the last election and we didn’t scare so easy. We were able to be all these things and do all these things because we were informed… by great men, men who were revered. First step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. America is not the greatest country in the world anymore.

> The fair share value of those SBE shares is easy to calculate, they're  collectively worth 247.7 million (2.40 billion enterprise value / 10.3)  divided by 31.9 million, which leaves you with **$7.76 / share**. 

Stopped reading here because you're retarded and can't do simple math. A few things:

(2400000000/10.3)/31900000 actually equals $7.30. What you meant was:

(2400000000\*.103)/31900000 which is \~$7.75, which seems to be what you did.

That said, you're ignoring that the new company is giving Chargepoint \~$310m in cash from the trust, and $225m from the PIPE. So if you take a company worth $2.4b and add $535m in cash, they're not still worth $2.4b. At the bare minimum, your math should have been:

(2935000000\*.103)/31900000 which is \~$9.48.

Of course, that's still retarded because Chargepoint has \~$450m of debt which is being wiped out, and that debt and the interest it accrues weighs on their valuation.

Use your imagination, you know what "delta hedging" and "gamma hedging" by dealers looks like in a melt up (see 2020, August). What will it look like in an unwind? Here's a hint: 10 point wide bid ask spreads followed quickly by vanishing liquidity as dealers completely pull their bids.

Exactly!!! 

Also the virus cannot survive in low temperatures. Not only that, no one is paying attention,  we're already close to herd immunization. Yes "cases" are skyrocketing which is a sign of herd immunization in combination with the lowest death tolls since the pandemic began. The virus has already killed as many baby boomers (the last remaining Great Depressioners have a far HIGHER rate of survivability than their successors the Baby Boomers!), morbidly obese and individuals with underlying health issues (not being mean...its just facts...survival of the fittest), also a greater portion of our population seems to either be immune or Asymptomatic, so the super spreaders did what both nature and immunization intended for them to do. 

Yes the fear of the yearly "flu" is a concern for everyone...but if you take the time to actually look at the virus this last strain evolution is so similar to the flu virus itself but on a far higher level and it seems to not allow any other virus to infect a person unless it was already there, so the flu shouldn't really be concern. 

If 1/2 the nation is hit with a snow front, shutting down airlines and travel impaction rendering the majority of citizens to remain home for 4 days or more....we effectively reduce this virus in the US Nation to low double digits to even  possibly single digits. 

I'm all for the vaccine in terms of gaining me a stupid amount of money and potentially making me rich and to allow us to return to some form of normality....but honestly they waited too long and I believe there is some shady in the shadows type of stuff that's not being addressed with the production of the vaccine and I'm not talking about the microchip conspiracy theories. 
Not really any trial runs, testings, etc...and then boom massive productions. 

Coronavirus is a new strain of the Sars virus.  It's a Sars virus that took on a new viral evolutionary path, but still holds Sars DNA. 
When china had that massive Sars outbreak years ago and it traveled to the US and affected many, many produced an immunity from being infected and others created another form of immunity (Asymptomatic), which would explain why so many hold those categories for this "brand new virus". 
So we already had things to combat Sars after that very first introduction to it and we even incorporated it into the flu shot (just read what's in your yearly flu shot....it has the Sars vaccine in it...)
I've never trusted Big Pharma since Obama sold us out to them and let them become a massive greedy overlord. We have 3 virus warehouses in the US, one of them right in here in my state of VA....they've already had a "cure" or rather vaccination for it, they knew that the virus would take out the weaker of the populace (population control), stifle the economy for a stronger reset, distract everyone from the issues that are happening over in the Middle East/Saudia Arabia (oil fields, we secured so many by answering the call of the King/prince of Saudia Arabia and defending his oil fields, giving us a massive amount as thanks and by demanding that he will ONLY trade in USD for his oil) as well as other things that not just our country has been doing but other countries sealing positions of power. 

Why did Gyms of all places close down!? The place you go to get into shape? Getting in shape...shit just working out consistently improves your immune system. Not a single case of the virus has been reported from a gym....

But Liquor stores and convenience stores were allowed to remain open. 
Schools closed down...but...day cares were allowed open? 
Grocery stores were allowed open, which stimulated the retail market in profits of never before seen potential due to panic buying. 

This was all a major reset, eventually leading to a change in power structure and allowing "new" money (potentially you, me, wsb) to enter the fray and potentially become new millionaires & multimillionaires and putting "old" money at a cautious gaze. Baby boomers removed a massive portion of not ALL of their monies from the banking systems and from the Market!!! Allowing us to enter in and take hold of what they covetted (creation of new gods to challenge the old gods, sorry was watching 'American Gods'). 

And when everything is starting to settle...now we have a vaccine! Lol 
Every vaccine has a small portion of the virus it protects against, I honestly feel that any baby boomer or anyone with a compromised immune system that takes the virus will probably die from it..not immediately but possibly 5yrs (again I can be horribly wrong), this vaccine is probably going to become mandatory nationwide. Seeing as it will put jobs at a dilemma with an employee that refuses to take it and other employees are afraid of becoming infected (even though they took the vaccine...smh), which would allow them to terminate that employee without any lawful action to be taken against them...

There's so many plays that are happening and will continue to happen. Part of me is actually seeing this as an opening for my/younger generations and a force out of older generations. An exchange of power and a reconstruction of our economic system and the flow of both finances and cash. 
The housing market changed rapidly with rates so excessively low, mimicking the 2008 market crash as well as the 2000 dot.com bubble crash. 
But look who is infiltrating and starting to control these businesses? 

Tldr; Too many variables, too many possibilities....the virus is dying out by itself. Its ran its course and it starting to get really cold and its own survivability rate is dropping rapidly.
366, then 367, then 368, then flat

@ Options traders, I have a question. I want to offload some PLTR calls for profit this week and hold some since my exp is 12/24. My thinking is to sell my calls that are deeper OTM. For example, I have a 28 and a 25. The delta is lower on the 28 and higher on the 25. So shouldn’t I sell the 28 and secure profit while holding the 25 since it’ll benefit more from a price rise because it’s delta is higher? And its already up a lot so it can take a hit

Staying in party hostels is quite possibly one of the most enjoyable experiences out there. It's basically like a fraternity where guys and girls are both staying together in the same rooms with strangers and there conveniently happens to be a bar on site and as much sex as you want if you have even a little bit of social skill.

With how fucked up the media has made things in the US right now, it's nice to know there are still places where things are normal.

Need a good play for this week.... anyone know any sure things? Like you have a guy on the inside that can give you tips that are then passed along to me?
You had me at towering intellects. I’m in
I (a moron) bought a LAZR 1/15 22p at the top. As the stock dropped like 8 dollars over 4 days, the option depreciated like 20%.... leading me to believe this is just an un-winnable option. This got me thinking--could we build a bot to choose good or bad options? surely there is a relatively easy way to just run the greeks and stock type through and algorithm to produce the most under and over valued options in a given week. Then theta the shit ones and buy the good ones
It’s something you would take much delight in, that’s for sure
Good luck my bulls, tmrw we feast on 🌈🐻

I used to live next to a freemasons meeting house.  It was a huge house with no windows and every Wednesday they would have a meeting and a ton of cars would park on the street.  A couple times we saw a dude wearing some robes that look similar to a preacher's robes.  
  
After about a year living there being very suspicious, all my roomates and I came to basically the same conclusion: it's a frat for old dudes.

$ABNB takes less risk than "this" company. They owe a few real estate, they can cut employees anytime and if a host or customer gets fked over a house stay $ABNB can take no responsibility.

Sorry I don't fully get your point. In any case, your assumption is incorrect, if you bought 100 usd worth of tqqq in 2010, it'd be worth roughly 9100 usd today. In fact you would have made way more that just 3x the returns of the index.

It'll probably be a while and there's possibly quite a bit more grind higher but it will be interesting when the SPX trades below 3000 again and the zeitgeist is, "ah well, we gave back all of 2020s gains, most of 2019's and now the market is where it was at the beginning of 2018. it makes sense, maybe the market got ahead of itself by rally feverishly and endlessly during one of the worst health crisis modern history and a global economic environment reminiscent of the 30's-era depression:"

Now they have an additional revenue stream though with the Microsoft deal.

Yeah, I’d sell and take the loss at this point personally. Feels like CRSR already had its run up and will be trading sideways for a while. 

I mean anything can happen, but that’d be like a 35% increase. Seems pretty unlikely considering how it has performed over the last few weeks. Good luck to you either way though, if you hold onto them I’ll be cheering for it to go on a face ripping run in January!

"Adderall contains a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine and dextroamphetamine are central nervous system stimulants that affect chemicals in the brain and nerves that contribute to hyperactivity and impulse control."

PMCC just carry a bigger risk of total loss than CCs if you’re putting the same amount of money into each strategy. If Apple dropped by 30% your calls would lose a lot more than 30% of their value. If Apple dropped by 50% then your long calls would be nearly worthless. There’s no option to wait five or ten years for a rebound. Is that a likely scenario? No. Is it possible that you can blow up your account doing this? Yes. If you’re willing to accept blow up risk for a little bit more money earned, then go for it.

If Apple rockets upward, you could be forced to exercise your long calls to cover the short calls, meaning you lose all the theta value of your longer dated options. 

Personally wouldn’t accept those risks myself.

Thanks, no problem. BTW, there's a whole community over at bogleheads sharing their experiences and knowledge with 3x strategies, Google hedgefundie's excellent adventure and you'll find it. I don't recommend the hedging with 3x long term treasuries, but many other variations are discussed also and reading through it all will teach you a lot about how these sorts of funds really work.

Also a while ago on wsb there was a thread from a guy who held 3x UPRO for 10 years (this was before Corona), might be interesting to check out too. Made him many millions iirc.

Proteostasis has the only CFTR Amplifier in the world (Nesolicaftor). CFTR amplifiers increase the number of CFTR proteins on the cell surface. If the cell makes more CFTR protein, it increases the flow of chloride ions across the cell membrane.

Historically the market rallies during the period up to Christmas. However during financial crisis periods - like 2008 - the market went down. You can Google it. There’s a lot of research on it. But keep in mind the stimulus negotiations, Trump’s lawsuits, Brexit, government shutdown, and vaccine news could affect the market. 

So yeah I’m gonna go long bro 🐂

Tesla is undervalued because they're gonna come out with a 20k car and make it absolutely fucktarded to buy anything else. They won't have enough factories to meet demand. 

They'll do the same with semis. 

And if anyone else manages to find their own ass and be successful at EVs, they'll have to pay Tesla licensing for their batteries and for the FSD. 

Self insured, robo taxis... its gonna get really stupid, really fast. Elon is gonna laugh his way into an antitrust hearing, and then he'll be richer than the Saudi and Windsor Royal families combined, so he'll either win or move Tesla to a different country that doesn't care.

For those of you who think vaccine will crush $SEARS IPO: think again. Video Game demand is much more inelastic than COVID meme play like ZM, Peleton, and TDOC.

$SEARS want to make more money for themselves. This is incredibly selfish of them.

For example:

\- $SEARS IPO in December 15 at $50 -> Shares open at $150 next day

\- $SEARS IPO in January 27 next year at $100 -> Shares open at $300 next day

Either  way investors will have to pay 3x in either case since $SEARS is a much  more well known co than Unity software, and will have similar stock  price trajectory as U.

\*COVID ending will slightly dump $SEARS once they release Q2 and Q3 2021 earning and they turn out to be garbage. But $SEARS will dip and then go back up until Epic Game IPO BTFOs $SEARS

&#x200B;

Basically,  SPAC and Direct listing are the way. I can't trust SPAC after NKLA scam. So I'm gonna put 50% of my money in  the next non-shit direct listing. 

Overpaying 3 times the IPO price on day 1 is only worth it for  god-tier company like Github, Robinhood, and Bumble

Gains are multiplied also. Say an index goes up 1% every day, after 10 days of holding a 3x etf, you will end up with **more than 3x** as much profit as holding the 1x index. Decay is only an issue when volatility is high or in a sideways or bear market, otherwise it works in your favor instead.

**[Edward A. Calahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward A. Calahan)**

Edward Augustin Calahan (1838–1912) was an American inventor, credited with invention of a ticker tape, gold and stock tickers, and a multiplex telegraph system.Calahan was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He left school at the age of 11 years of age to pursue his interest to be part of a modern business.Calahan came to New York City in 1861 and made his residence in Brooklyn. He joined as chief telegrapher in Western Union telegraph company's New York office at Manhattan. While working with Western Union, he encountered a group of rushing messenger boys which inspired him to improve exchange communications.

[This is the guy who invented the stock ticker.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_A._Calahan)  He left school at the age of 11 years of age to pursue his interest to be part of a modern business. Then he started fucking ADT Security which is still around. This is why I think we started going downhill when we got rid of child labor. Imagine the life skills we'd have.
So funny how none of these bears are posting short positions. They just repeat blockbuster 2.0 over and over again. Plot twist! What  if they’re not really bears and they are actually parrots owned by Melvin Capital??
If TDA had a feature that gave me a "double or nothing" option right after market close everyday I'd probably take it everytime
No one really cares tbh, nowhere else to put your hard earned money but stonks. go try putting all your money in a savings account or bonds, see how that goes for you. As long as the interest rates are low, we'll keep on mooning.

Still, that being said, it's time I cut back a bit and start the weaning process. Don't really need this shit to function anymore. I hope, and if I do I don't think I need to get back to 60mg a day

I watched an interview with that Karp guy and I was sold. This guys focus and direction is so clear and concise. Really made me a believer.

Part of the allure of MP is that they are gearing up to be a supplier for the western hemisphere. Trump made an executive order for the US to source from them and we only see Biden turning up the juice on all variety of electric motors/generators.

There is no replacement for performance. Yeah sure there may be supply chains looking to diversify but if these materials are superior, it's a good play.

THANK YOU!!! 

A few years ago, I was the Market in Pennsylvania (I love that place!) For a tournament. I went over to the Amish Cheese stall to buy mother some nice farm cheese as a nice gift for her. The kid (probably 19yrs) working behind the counter (skinny, very short beard, could tell he was just starting to grow it...but was still thicker and more full than mine) was sat down on a seat infront of the register with his hands under it doing something. So the first thought I had was that he's probably either literally twiddling his thumbs or playing pocket pool. I guess I startled him and he stands up and drops an iPhone....he literally takes his foot and shoves it under the woodwork of where the register is.

I was so angry cause I thought they weren't allowed to use technology and he had a WAAAY better phone than me! 

We talked for about a good 40-45min, and he explained that times had changed so much for them. That their elders wanted to keep them in the dark and basically like religious savages, but eventually became out voted and forced to see their own ignorance. He said that the majority of younger Amish (30yrs below) have accepted technology, understand and embrace networking and have fused it with technology and "religion". When I told him that I was an Atheist he admitted that he was too, but would NEVER say it to anyone much older than him or the elders. He said that they are basically waiting for the current elders to die out and then to basically give a choice to anyone willing to leave that life style at any time not just rumspringa. He said there's so much potential in the world, people, colors, money and the unknown...but his own people (primarily the older generations) would rather see them looked at as inbred hillbilly religious savages than human people that want to be part of the world they live in. 
He said that it was the younger generations that convinced the elders to allow them to use technology but not in the presence of outsiders and to make money off of the "impures" and not from impurity itself (which to the elders is 2 totally different things!?. Robbing a bank is bad, but if bank robbers gave offerings and tithes to a church, it's not wrong to accept it....go figure)

I mean the failsafe system works perfectly, nothing blew up; and they glided safely to the ground like bosses. The error was the onboard computer didn’t register the rocket correctly and within 1 second it engaged the failsafe. Bullish as fuck, means their shit is safe as fuck it takes 0 chances. The shit either works flawlessly or back to safety you and your rich fucking family goes.

Stock will still take a hit though. I think I’ll sell my short dated calls and buy shares on the dip... trying to time this thing is hurting me and I know as soon as they fire off a succeessful run the shares will at least double anyways.

Not for batteries. Specifically for the 4680, which is a brand new battery design that changes the chemistry. It doesn't, for example, use cobalt at all. So I wonder, does it still use Neodymium? 

So far, haven't seen a mention. Or even an explanation of what Neodymium is used for in batteries. But if Tesla doesn't use it in the new batteries, then it's a bad bet.

why?
$SEARS want to make more money for themselves. This is incredibly selfish of them.

For example:

\- $SEARS IPO in December 15 at $50 -> Shares open at $150 next day

\- $SEARS IPO in January 27 next year at $100 -> Shares open at $300 next day

Either way investors will have to pay 3x in either case since $SEARS is a much more well known co than Unity software, and will have similar stock price trajectory as U.

&#x200B;

Basically, SPAC and Direct listing is the way. I'm gonna put 50% of my money in the next non-shit direct listing. IPO 3x overpaying is only worth it for god tier company like Github, MindGeek, Onlyfan and Bumble.

If they stay as they are now, not much/nothing will change. But with Cohen leading the way, I expect drastic changes to the management of GME. 

In the ideal scenario it will switch primarily to online sales, with possibilities for the retail stores besides selling the obvious hardware, also being used as pick-up locations or perhaps even morph in some kind of gaming café (wildly popular in Asian countries). 

The possibilities are there, they just have to make the move.

They literally just cut you a check from the processor for your percentage and then you get a 10-99 at the end of the year.

people who buy options for stocks like SE TTD SQ ROKU with stupid fucking bid ask spreads and not a lot of volume, how do you check for what has the most OI and tightest bid ask spread for those stocks to get the best deal?
I may do it at the start of the year. When I did a couple years ago it was about $10/hr after factoring in gas and 25% tax. I hear it's more now, but I'll believe it when I see it myself. It's more like a stress-free way to burn off extra time to fund some entertainment for later

I heard the market cap is gonna be $1.5 billion. They’re gonna do 160 million in revenue this year and they’ve been making a small profit for all 12 years of existence. They’re doing like 4x the revenue they were doing 4 years ago so growth is great. Obviously the potential legalization on the federal level is a huge plus
We have no way of knowing that they haven't already.

Sure, but that's $1200-ish dollars that I didn't expect to have. Is it better to have an extra $1200? Sure. But if I'm going to lose $1200, it hurts a lot less if I first gain an unexpected $1200; at the end of the month, my net becomes $0 instead of ($1200).

SMG looks interesting but commercial crops will probably be grown hydro or aero, not in dirt it will cost too much. And the chem/noots* game (nutrients for you noobs) is already handled by bigAg, SMG is barely a flash in that pan.

Serious question:

Is the $1000c @ $0.35 12/18, a realistic or profitable option(s) to purchase to just make immediate gains/tendies cause of the S&P hype? Or is that too far up and would get dicked cause of Theta?

Think we are probably green all futures until open where tech dumps and turns markets red and then they recover all day when that money moves into recovery stocks. 

they did not react well when trump initially brought it up but recovered after senate/house passed with veto proof majority.  Unfortunately, trump can still veto it (he promised today) and lots of GOP senate and house members have all said they'd respect trump's veto so we'll see what happens... McConnell needs Georgia Senate seats and an unhappy trump is gonna be painful for him

You realize that 99% of the 3,000 deaths were people over 85 years old. A group of people finally dying after living 10 years past the normal.life span. Those images do nothing to me. They don't strike any fear. I don't really care. Death is a sad thing but I can guarantee you the majority of people who are dropping dead left and right had Death knocking on their door for months if not years. Modern medicine keeps way too many people alive that have no business being alive. You can think that's cold but you probably don't work in healthcare. It's just a fact of life that you get used too pretty quick when you're around sick-sick people.
Another fucking nonsensical logic.
Can we replace seeking alpha with this sort of journalism
He could do that (YOLO 200k on weeklies) or maybe do something less retarded and be a millionaire in a year or two with mildly risky stocks/leaps plays. Dave's point is solid, don't get me wrong, but he compares reasonable risk taking to playing the lottery, which is wrong on so many levels. There is a reason around 25% of people trading get positive returns, which i think is a far higher percentage than those who consistently buy lotto tickets. That reason being that patience, some brain power and playing it risky but not retarded are all factors that will skew things in your favor along with knowledge and, of course, luck.

tl;dr: don't play weeklies and you'll get money and bitches
Wtf is this 💩

It was a sexy video but being in this space my biggest takeaway was integrated access requests and approvals in the platform. Most places have a BI tool and an access request tool like ServiceNow.

That said would love to see more about how they unify source data into one model and what visualization capabilities it has. Most of the work for dashboards is in sourcing and wrangling the data. Would love to zee more on the data lineage which the other major BI tools have. It looks sexy and simple when you show it then implementation requires a ton of work.

PowerBI and Tableau also have the granular security Palantir does with Purpose (PBI calls it Workspace and Tableau calls them Projects).

Lastly I own some PLTR because it's cool. I'm not against them at all and I hope they moon so we all make money!

2022 calls could have given this guy more time to sell at the first sign of trouble. So no, not rich, but he is much less likely to lose all of his money. Also, it doesn’t have to meet any of his strike prices he would just need one good green swing in his direction (well before exp) for profit or to break even. So I would not say that this is shoe shine boy thinking.

If you're actively trading you want volatility.  That's where all the money is.  Traditionally Forex is much much more volatile than equities but the equities market is so fucking wild right now it's not worth it. 

This is actually a good time to dip your foot in since USD is at a ridiculous lows.  Once stonks start stabilizing you'll have the skillset to easily transition over
The lone exception to this is Tesla calls/puts since it jumps or drills ridiculously fast, right?

It's red cause it's a week long chart but you grabbed 0dte on day 6.
I usually read that as “Hookups only”
If the economic data continues to show signs of improving (watch currencies of large commodity exporters (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc) for a read on global economic conditions)) then stonks will likely continue to march higher over the medium term. We should continue to see a rotation out of long duration stocks (tech) and into more economically sensitive stocks (I like fertilizer stonks here, since it's all bullshit anyways).  


Note: no one gives a shit about unemployment. That's on the federal government now to figure out (UBI-like benefits in exchange for getting plugged with vaccine IMO).  


Note: the system is awash in liquidity. speculative mania has reached historic proportions (rivalled only with 1929 & 2000 period). these dynamics don't change overnight however there will be a very, very expensive price to pay for all of this and when it happens, the worst case scenario is it begins just as faith in the Fed and dotgov to "solve" for the crisis collapses. At that point, you don't even want to own puts because there will be serious doubts that your counterparty will be able to pay out.   


Good luck!

Totally different investments. The Vanguard ETFs match a broad market, sector, etc and tend to be passively managed so they have low expense ratios. As vehicles for long term, safe investments they cannot be beat. The ARK ETFs have a much higher expense ratio because they are actively managed. In exchange, they provide higher upside (and downside) due to exposure to individual growth stocks. 

If I were advising someone looking to create a long term portfolio, I would include both

Honestly? GME should lower the spread between buying and selling your games.

Really low 5% or something like that plus a subscription. Players want to play!

That will drive up traffic and generate a Netflix model make money selling a crapton of baby yodas. 

Became an exchange, a platform! Let prices fluctuate based on demand.  Make money on low commissions and subscriptions. Lower overhead and cut the fat on small redundant stores.

You cant depend on having customers every 4 years and then turn into a ghost town!
Where's everyone getting their news about positive stimulus talks? Can't find a valid source anywhere lol
I'll let you in on it, it's a secret society. If you put no hookups on your profile too then you're in and buddy I tell you there's a ton of hookups
It would also reduce their on hand supply when high demand happens, like big releases. Might push more people digital.

Though it's been years since I've been I do feel like half of their shelves are just used games, so I guess that could still thrive.

No checks for the people but unemployment gets an extension? Sounds like a "fuck you" to everyone who kept their job but had hours/future raises cut because of "the slowing covid economy " or whatever bull your employer said to you.

As long as something passes the market will print green for the rest of the week.

Good job bears who bought puts for tomorrow, expect a sideways or red day.

Okay that still isn't much. What was the person's underlying health before. Are they genetically more susceptible to longer complications? Did they get a specific strain of COVID that is more likely to cause longer term problems. As the virus continues to mutate which most experts believe has occurred at least three times how will the affect the efficacy of the vaccine long term?

I just had to look this up.  The internet says that LT. Dan was an angel in investor in Apple and used a 100k to take a 3% stake.  On IPO day in 1980 the shares were worth 46million and by 1994 when the movie was released they were worth 96million.  Today that would be worth close to 60billion.  

In other words.  Way to fucking go Lt. Dan! You magnificent retard!

As if men have never been promiscuous.
Yes but that is a part of what is holding up stimmy negotiations.
The overarching point about grandparents is there is no way to fully protect them. Isolation is not realistic for most elderly relying on others to survive. With that said the others can only do so much to protect their loved ones. At the end of the day there is going to be a risk that cannot be mitigated. Sick elderly people will die and that's a fact. They should get the vaccine because that's really the only option they have. That's a risk calculation. I don't think young people that have no interaction with elderly people should be forced to get a vaccine.
The movie took place in the 80s before the IPO gump would’ve been an angel investor buying in probably way below any prices seen in the market

You have to put in limit sell orders in case the price skyrockets for a little pit on Thursday, Friday or Monday.

50 shares at 1000, 50 at 1200, 50 at 1500 etc.

Some experts are saying it will be the largest buy on close order ever, the order book would be emptied if that's the case.

Honestly I think what happened is there was an underestimation how dysfunctional and terrible most of the world is.  They thought globalization would level the standard of living through most of the world by now and its happened some but not near fast enough and instead actually dropped the standard of living of a lot of people in the first world.  Seriously if you ever think the news is fucked up in the US read news from Pakistan sometime and you will be like thank fucking god or whoever.  Some countries are too fucked up to ever be developed.

That's a good point, but we are not talking about a single massive unpredictable shift, we see many types of piecemeal innovations reducing/substituting dependence on rare earth materials.. The trend is very much there:

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/idtechex-explains-how-electric-vehicles-are-eliminating-rare-earths-301158962.html


I understand you have a short term strategy, but what about the non transparency of markets? what if the price of those materials is manipulated to be kept low, keeping competition out of the game? With price rising you'll unleash australian, japanese, canadian, US miners and easily get oversupply. 

Are all these risks worth the potential small 
gains?

In any case .. good luck!!!
It’s PLTR or bust retard. Don’t fight meme power
What? I was obviously talking about expiration date.

“If Amazon goes up to 3200, the call will be worth much more n they can sell the options for profit”
No it won’t unless Amazon goes to 3200 super quickly. If Amazon is at 3200, maybe a week before the Feb expiration date, the option is worth way less than he paid for it(it’ll be worth something like $60 when he paid $200).

Actually, you’re wrong.  Sometimes buying a stock makes sense for fundamental reasons, other times technicals. But I was playing sentiment with that one more than anything.  I was confident that I could tell where the herd was headed and could manage my position accordingly.  Trevor Milton was obviously a snake oil salesman from jump street.

Well if we went full Darwinism our society just wouldn’t function. Take that perspective and universalize it (if you’re familiar with Plato) to everything, and you’ll see how it just is impossible in modern society. 

What’s really happening is that this individual is not viewed as having the potential to add value to society, and therefore he receives no help.

I hear you.  There’s free money sitting out there.  It’s nuts, and I imagine won’t last.  But it’s sitting out there because volatility is expected.  Passing on the potential of another 200-300% to take in a guaranteed 20-30% has made me feel dumb recently.  Heck, I bought ChargePoint shares at $17-18 and sold $25 short term calls.  Sounds great, but not so much when the warrants go up 500%, the shares 200%, and I made 50%.  Not really greed, it’s more managing risk appropriately.  Sometimes it’s better to be more aggressive in a risk on environment.  Also, $3-5 million is a more a bogey than $1.5-2 million.  I know o could get there with patience taking less risk, trying to pick my spots.  Besides where’s the fun in that
I said the trade he made did not require any genius. You're making a nonsensical connection to all trades.

I’m a big fan of buy a handful of contracts, sell your cost basis when you think it’s lost some steam, and let the house money ride until you feel it’s coming down. 

Left some winnings on the table with this, but also realized some large gains that I’d have probably missed if I was playing a contract or two.

Dw I’m not putting them on a pedestral, fuck them truly. I did read though that women tend to cheat more when theyre younger but after some years men overtake them as the bigger cheating sex. 

Also, I feel like women are vastly more successful in hiding their infidelities, which is why I think the man cheating results in divorce more often.
Check out the charts, this could retest $35 again if not go higher next week. High chance I will double my money on just a few % move.

Yeah man seems to be a lot of bullish sentiment and 2 weeks of more or less sideways price action. PLTR bounced off of an ascending support line yet again and I don't think it will revisit that anytime soon. I think I'm gonna buy immediately at open unless it's already above $30 in premarket. I already loaded calls on Friday but I only had 1.2k in my account, and 600 just got approved over the weekend. I'm super tempted to buy weeklies then buy long term near itm calls with the profits.

This company is not the one that orders the collection of the data in the first place, or the one that orders it should be kept for many decades or all eternity.

They just integrate what's already there. That's not really immoral imo. Quite the opposite, because they try very hard with the versioned datassets, purpose need to access datasets, keeping very detailed records of all the data... They are following more the EU government approach to data than the typical Silicon Valley Zuckerberg approach. I think the EU data-protection approach is the moral correct choice. There's no way of going back to not collecting all that data anymore. It's just to valuable and offers so many opportunities. So better dealing with how/who/why has access to which data, is more morally correct than how most of silicon valley deals with data. Yet they claim PLTR is on the wrong side of data? They crazy.

When dealing with options there's really nothing "expected" ever. Like if we were to say you can "expect" to see 8% annual growth rate on a diversified investment account over a very long period of time, that's not totally unreasonable but with an option contract you could *expect* to make anywhere from -100% to +1000%.

It may never be worth more than it was when you bought it and then your negative returns are only capped by when you're willing to sell at a loss. It may skyrocket up for a short time and when you see +1000% gains you think "holy fuck im going to make 10,000% gains on this!" And then you hold as it drops all the way back down to what you paid for it, and then you hold longer hoping to recoup some of those losses, and then you just hold it until its worth nothing.

Good strategy!
Its so many companies in hotels, consumer and travel that have high short interest. Hipefully the bears realize those stonks not going lower. Que the squeezenings
It might be shorts, since the market maker is on the other side he is long but hedged. Otherwise definitely some autist.
$85 3/21... I know the feeling.

My worst was a TQQQ $85C when it hit $140/share.
Startups that are profitable early on are actually typically shit because it means the ceo is not focused on growth. Very rarely does it mean there’s no way for it to be profitable, but focusing on profit is much better when you have a huge moat rather than early on and missing out on the moat and thus multiple times the potential profit
Did you know instead of buying calls on DKNG you can continue the rushes 7 days a week?
Pretty much.
Its up from $2.57 since March. If anyone is a bag holder its the 35 million shorts who all entered under $10/share. 

High school you is still a 🤡 if you think the stock is up because of a magical squeeze.
Yes I’m the way way tbh .. where you live at my friend ?
I feel your pain. I hate missing out but I made money and I learned a lot from it.
Lol. Stonk bros!! 🤜🤛 Had it under 13 but averaged up all day Friday.

Yes this is very easy to say from our perspective. But life for these people is not like the Sims. You must take into account that these people may not know the options they have, and how they can begin to claw their way out of the hole they are in. 

If you believe social psychology then these people are so used to how their life is it is not as easy as simply “clean up and get a job.” They need an third party to place them in that better position.
We'll moon together bro🚀🚀🚀
Because you know they have to take your cock no matter what. 

Now you’re just fucking with them. And it’s fun. 

Especially when the institutions shorted you out of credit ratings from 2016-2017. Feels good to give it to them make them look stupid.
No.  The headline, $50k to $1.5MM.

Like 3 hours after open so I can get some shares before they moon ahaha
Maybe not eow I think it might get up to $17-$18 and hover from there. The acquisition isn't until Feb 2021 so it has some room before take off. Just keep buying the dips and you'll get the chips my friend.
Yeah I might attempt lowering my average cost. There’s a chance it comes back up in the short term though. It flew comfortably at 70-73 before Toyota made their battery claims

Buying back low on positions that won’t print though.
A place like Huntsville sounds like the move.  Somewhere up and coming under the radar.  Can always move back.  I think CA will be reset eventually
I'm just getting a feel of them. Figured if they day tradeable then I'll be using them as another gain tool.
Bruh I had 5/21 $12.5c I sold off in October.
I have 230 shares right now, one 30c Jan 15 call and picking up more shares as I make profits from other options. Long term play for me. Or ITM or close to itm calls. But vaccine play for this is good news so that might help it pump. Plus it’s Monday.  You can chance it and buy at open. It’s a weird market man. I thought NET was going to keep running last week so much that I bought back a covered call on Friday that I should have on Thursday only to have to drop again and would have expired worthless..by the pltr call I sold last week expired worthless.
Yup.

Solid plays. APXT concerns me a little because AvePoint gets so much of their revenue from Microsoft.  Not necessarily a bad thing.  Pershing, I’d guess Ackman will get it right.  I e been in PSTH some, but it’s pre-announcement of anything, and he has 2 years, so it’s good risk/reward but you’re not investing in a company yet.
Dude use Grindr it’s so much better
I hadn’t thought of it like that.
Same. And try not to get emotionally attached (like most around here it seems). Take profit and move on
How do you guys not use day trades immediately after they reset. I always feel like I sell my calls after going down 15-20%
Go to a credit union or savings bank. I got a 10% down no PMI at 3.625% on a duplex a year ago. I know you can get a 5% down no PMI still, likely 3.25%. Depends on your situation. But I’d rather keep the cash and invest it, even if I’m making booker 8% returns I’m doing better on the spread, plus I have a safety net. Find a property you can improve and force equity, buy a 2-4 unit and have your tenants pay the mortgage. No or low money down is the way.
What expiry you thinking?

A lot of canadian companies already have the infrastructure and capital, and are poised to expand through already-established partnerships with US locations or other global locations. Its not unreasonable for them to boom in response to US/global cannabis news. Thats why I’m in on sundial and TLRY. TLRY exports to Israel, a country that announced its plan to legalize recreational cannabis within 9 months. Obvious boom coming soon, I copped calls for june.

Very true but you don’t need many options you just need to take any opportunity you can.. like McDonald’s, Walmart, Amazon. Join a gym for $10 a month from begging on the street. Shower shave, go to a free library, apply for the jobs, get minimum wage job and boom you’re back on your feet. I started from making $7.25 an hour with no help from parents so there’s no excuse an adult cannot do the same. Just because I was 18 and they’re older, people view it differently

I’m not a show-off.  Probably more the opposite.  But SPACS are the rage.  There’s posts from folks that claim they get it because track record or because DraftKings or Hyliion or Fisker all over the place.  So, figured for posterity, I’d toss up Fantasia on SPACs #5...it’s legit though.  I’m an OG back to Virgin Galactic a year ago, and have made money every round, onto DraftKings, Nikola, and more than a handful on the rounds that have followed.  I believe I’m pretty close to unique in that regard.  I know a handful of folks that were in Galactic with me early, but maybe none of them continued with SPACs all the way through.  Even folks that claim they did didn’t really.  I bought Galactic after Adam Jonas’ piece early December last year, and Nikola early March when they were on CNBC.
Yeah, I was still writing it. All the best.

This video is just full of word salad. If you'd like to explain what foundry or PLTR does then explain it with real-world use cases. Just don't read all these technical jargon from their website. I'm not interested in supposed use cases. I want real-world examples. It almost feels like both PLTR and this video uses technical jargon to fool people into thinking that this company will provide godmode abilities to its customers. Well if that's PLTR's claim, then I say prove it by making money. Revenue and profits are the real indicators of success.

I could be wrong, but this video hasn't convinced me that I am.

Fuck no. Plenty of money to be made riding a wave if you get out in time. How many people lost money on PLTR, XPENG, TSLA, NIO, etc., etc. puts that were too short dated? If someone says something is free money just do like a little bit more research.
Yeah ✊
So the only actual new offering here is the All Access package, which the author estimates to be 10% revenue share. 5 million sales at $35/month = 2.1 billion in revenue. 10% share = 210 million in revenue to GME. So GME is getting ~200 mil in additional revenue per year (hopefully) on a product that will absolutely, no doubt, eat into their existing sales. That amounts to 3% of their total revenue in a year when they have extremely low numbers because of it being the end of a cycle. How is this at all supposed to be a game changer for them?
Don't buy GME this retard just wants out of a sinking ship. Bet dude sells as soon as he's above water bc rn GME us at 13 something

I don’t have student debt so wouldn’t make a difference to me. I just think the “where is the money gonna come from” argument is irrelevant. Also wouldn’t mind, seeing people who at the age of 17/18 had to sign on for debt because it was drilled to them that they had to go to college, be relieved of it.
Would be rough to do that prior to Christmas. Could see it going higher and dump after the holiday.

I keep saying this to all these TA gurus constantly talking about what the chart is gonna do. These charts are all meaningless in this market. Only technical I really care about is RSI to show when a move is getting a bit overcooked. Other than that, it’s All about volume and hype these days it seems, at least short term.
It’s weird don’t people talk to other people? How come people don’t notice their neighbors business is going under? I guess people really have accepted big business as the way things are.
Someone else would take over and definetly wouldn’t sell shit. Younger guy would probably buy more so uppies.

I bought Nikola when it was VTIQ, out of conviction that the herd would follow after I got in.  That’s not conviction on fundamentals.  It’s conviction that I was confident where the herd would go before they did.  That’s a big difference.  I think Nikola is headed to zero.
use google.

And what spread would that be?
Can someone tell me when etf fees are charged? Like specifically fo ARK, can you sell and then buy back in to avoid the charge?

What is wrong with you? You interpreted what I said in the most creepy way possible. Are you actually autistic? 

I only wanted to point out using relatively few words that young women are considered the most value to most men. There is extensive research on this point. In fact, before I placed the comment, I verified this and found an article that in hyper-competitive environments like New York, the worth of women declines after year 18, not 22.
OK and what's wrong with that? I am a neuro typical meaning I do have autism so if I act the way that you say that I am what's wrong with it?  Are you trying to say that and a neuro typical individual  Isn't as invalid as you are? that's literally what I said in the last post, you're trying to use this word as if it can shut down an argument it's hateful and vitriolic and you're an evil piece of shit.

He made half a gamble/half a prediction and it was far enough out. Even if TSLA returned to it’s pre covid price his contracts would’ve been worth $20k each... a lot more than the $115 he paid for it.
It’s an uphill battle for the EV companies. Oil and gas companies still have a strong political hold. They will lay any bumps along the way to make EV harder to launch in America. Though I can see China more easily rolling out EV. Not a lot of political lobbying happening there. Plus, China sees annual smog alerts in China.

Moderna vaccine approval up this week. moderna is the better vaccine as its phase 3 was 95%, which made pfizer “correct” their results. Also easier to store mdra vs pfizer. Pfizer’s marketing team have been working overtime to keep pfizer in the news, but governments will likely see thru it and order Moderna once fda approves.

It seems very unequal how that all got paid out. My grandmas church got all the money they asked for through PPP right away and already got it forgiven.

Granted they went through a local bank owned by my uncle. But it seems like they was definitely a real and intentional lack of oversight on PPP.
GameStop price target lowered to $5 from $6 at Benchmark Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey lowered the firm's price target on GameStop (GME) to $5 from $6 after the company reported "disappointing" Q3 revenue, gross profit and EBITDA along with comparable store sales that declined 24.6%. Hickey also noted that the company established a program to offer and sell up to $100M common stock and he expects "they will dilute shareholders." The analyst, who believes growth in GameStop's e-commerce sales is "a function of the virus influence rather than a compelling platform" and thinks the idea they can compete with Amazon (AMZN) "is comical," keeps a Sell rating on the shares.
That’s a 20% jump bro. I fucking hope so, don’t get me wrong, but eheh..

Tesla is the biggest producer and consumer of batteries in the world. The material they are worried about running out of is Nickel. They engineered themselves out of needing cobalt, do they still need Neodymium?

What is the ingredient list on a 4680?

I'd look for nickel mines, maybe.

I bought an itm leap a few weeks ago. Just going to chill until late summer early fall. Not going to be a massive win but should basically be free money as long as you buy a reasonable strike a year or so out. If I had more money to throw at options though I would pick a cruise line to throw money at. Probably going to be much bigger winners. I just picked JETS because it was the cheapest travel related play to make.

i'm also loaded on GME/PLTR

SPY 280P is an excellent way to kill all your gains from the good positions
Its so funny seeing people down vote you like the stock didnt just take a shit on GME bagholders. It was always just a pump based on a fictional magical squeeze. Now people are mad that its not happening after buying OTM calls and shares at the top 🤡 middle school me would clown my ass if I was buying shares from some garbage company like gamestop

$TSLA will net profit but at the expense of your mental health. One day you're up $1K then the next you're down $900. Repeat over and over and over. How much higher can it go anyway?  


$DKNG, however, can ONLY go up. Buy in now before it get's too expensive.

Pltr still consolidating side ways this week before its massiv rip past 45
Why not just 6/18 calls? It’s gone up over $11 in 3 months. I think any of the 6/18 calls are free money right now
Aside from the obvious ARKG and its top holdings, I am extremely bullish on TMO (Cathie has been adding too). It's bottomed out from vaccine news (priced in decline in COVID testing revenue), and now has crazy low IV. Market has not priced in its upside from the vaccine including but not limited to its freezers. It's an amazing company and will always find a way to profit from science. All in on July calls.
Retard alert
look, i’m bullish on tsla long term. but every single stock that has ever been added to SPX has dropped right after inclusion date.

I feel like we may have a repeat of last week where we rose to about 370 371 midweek and then move downward EoW as it becomes apparent that there is not going to be a stimulus bill agreement and the govt will be shutting down.
Bull for what? GME or TSLA or in general?
Yes but I am pretty sure that they don’t control it.
SPY will trade between 200 and 500 For most of the week with movements up, down, and to the right.
The article is a bearish hit piece but should be bullish IMO. Affirms they are going to a more heavy e-commerce route. 

And with debts going down and revenues on an upward trend, this seems more like a “we’re closing because these stores don’t fit our future plan” rather than a forced close due to “we’re broke af”.
So you’re saying I shouldn’t have sold my kidney to buy GME calls???

New shorts piling on just fuel the continuous upward trend. Look at the GME chart. It is in a clear upward trend.
https://imgur.com/w5l1WxB

It 'sells off' on a spike because shorts are trying their hardest to contain it. MSFT news was targeted by bears with false information and hit pieces. The $20 pop the other week took lots of capital from short firms to try and contain the move. Tens of thousands of puts were opened to try and drive price down that Monday morning. If you're watching intraday price action you can see the shorts at work.

Q3 was bad and was expected. Q4 will be profitable and show growth. You seemed to have listened to the CC so you know this already. You're literally telling people to sell at the bottom when we know there will be another top.

I mean you still own the stock though. You could just hold onto it if you believe in the company. In addition, you can get out by buying the call option. So if there is a rug pull, you will buy the call (which will be way cheaper now) and then you can sell. The strategy works if you believe the stock will be stable or growing slightly in the future.

Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement
On September 2, 2020, Kensington and the Holders entered into a Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement, which shall be effective at the Closing. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement, Kensington will be obligated to file a registration statement to register the resale of certain shares of Kensington Common Stock held by the Holders after the Closing. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement and subject to certain requirements and customary conditions, including with regard to the number of demand rights that may be exercised, the Holders may demand at any time or from time to time, that Kensington file a registration statement on Form S-3 (or on Form S-1 if Form S-3 is not available) to register the securities of Kensington held by such Holders, and Kensington is separately required at all times to maintain an effective resale registration statement for the benefit of the Holders. The Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement will also provide the Holders with “piggy-back” registration rights, subject to certain requirements and customary conditions.
The Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement further provides for the securities of Kensington held by the Holders to be locked-up for a period of time following the Closing, as described below, subject to certain exceptions. The securities held by the Sponsor will be locked-up for one year following the Closing, subject to earlier release if (i) the reported last sale price of New QuantumScape Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Closing or (ii) if New QuantumScape consummates a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction after the Closing which results in all of New QuantumScape’s

This is one of the all-time funniest financial news pieces I've ever seen. Gamestop in essence just became another large client for Microsoft but people fully treated it like it was the other way around. It made zero difference to the long term viability of a retail video game store. One of the highlights of the "deal" was that Gamestop associates are now going to have Microsoft Surface tablets. Wow. The cheetoh fingered 19 year old minimum wage earning salesperson now has a *tablet* to look up *similar games* to the ones the customers are buying. Revolutionary deal. GME to the moon.

I think people are optimistic the government will reach a stimulus agreement, thus elevating the pressure from a potential government shutdown as well as printing some Christmas spending checks for the people.  If mitch and Nancy want to pump the economy, there is no better time than the present

This seems to be discussing Founder Shares which have to do with the originators of the company. The document seems to clearly distinguish this from PIPE shares and as also stated in the document, Kensington will keep the resale registration statement active to allow PIPE shares to be sold.

Probably buy some calls this week.  I looked back at all the companies that have been added to sp500 in the last few years and there is always a giant volume spike on the day they're added, but oddly very low price movement.  I dont know how that makes sense really.  The volume spikes are usually *massive* compared to a stocks normal trading volume, but still barely any price movement.

With the amount of shares that have to be bought up for Tesla though, fuck it, I'll gamble on it.
Lol I didn't tell her I was up 300% last month and I flipped all of it into bad positions, including PLTR and GME.

Currently YOLO'd in $DG.  I still have exposure to GME in 1/15 calls but they have so little value im considering my DG position a YOLO.
Not if they use dominion machines 😂
You know, thats a solid take on it. A little tinfoil hat sprinkled in with some legitimate theory crafting. I dig it. I'm adding that to the list of perspectives on this wild ride.
they were actually lifting rates pre-covid for this very reason
Personally, I'm leaning toward a drop but like you said, with the crazy euphoria, who knows, we could see new ATHs by EOW or hell, even by closing on Monday. Might as well push markets up to make all puts expire worthless on quad witching day.
If it goes to 200, you lost out on a lot of money. You are capping your potential gains for some immediate money and a risk that the stock tanks.

Depends what you feel comfortable with. GME is volatile and can jump 40% in a week as we have seen multiple times over the last few months. IV is so stupidly high that way OTM weeklies can still net a good premium.
Pretty sure it’s more than that. [This article](https://thecollective.finance/2020/10/gamestop-gme-a-squeeze-to-44-from-14-can-be-justified-fundamentally-100-of-the-shares-are-short-watch-out/) explains a lot about GME. The part about the Xbox deal:

>How does it work? Lets say a new X Box X costs $499, the typical margin is around 10% so that is $50. However, what if a customer takes a monthly package such as the All Access package and doesn’t pay up front for the console and can access games from the cloud : https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access#findaretailer that is $35 per month. So that is estimated to be a 10% rev share with GameStop at $3.5 per month which will be $84 margin over 2 years instead of a one off of $49. When you start considering $25bn or $30bn of total sales over a console cycle that becomes really significant. 5 million XBox X passes could be $210mn of pure margin per year for 2 years. This compares with forecasted EBITDA in January 2020 of $167mn.

nothing wrong with catching a stock's rise bc the memes on here but if you are easily swayed by shit posters to close your positions or diamond hand it w/o understanding the markets, you're gonna lose all your money 100% over long run. You got to take time to learn shit on your own and hone your edge. Don't just blindly follow herd mentality
Nah, puts. They are shitty.
Big wrong, lots of good strong business just barely clinging on now. Especially restaurants here in mi
more please.
Sell at a loss and buy a call on a different stock. That got me from down 10% to up 100%
If stock goes above 100, u make 100$+ premium, stock goes down = 100- price + premium
A ways out. Much larger barrier to entry than amazon’s core business but even MORE explosive & impactful. Easy to see and hard to believe.

That said, the curve is going to be immense.

You're assuming they stay on the same path.  China's long term plan is just straight up copying US history.  

The past decades is just an accelerated industrial revolution to get from farmers to factory workers.  Stealing IP is the same, to get technical data while sending kids overseas to get a taste of western thinking to learn how to innovate.  

A certain percentage of kids come back because loyalty to family (ie. govt can disappear them) and money.  Innovate based on previously acquired IP and profit; see Huawei and chinese version of all major apps/sites.  The competitive edge is govt manipulation of the market: see chinese shanghai stock market (one of the reasons they are cracking down on HK ahead of schedule, to disrupt preferred hk stock market).  

Simultaneously, they are flexing on other southeast asian nations for trade advantages (offloading all the cheap labor, "made in China" crap) as well as African nations for raw materials in exchange for infrastructure (see banana republic).  

Pooh bear is consolidating power now to prevent a future, more educated/wealthy population from leading the farmers in another revolution.  This is where they diverge from the US, as they don't have the 2-parties to co-opt political movements from the people (see: Dems and Bernie; Rep and tea party/Trump).
I could be selling covered calls, but I have my TSLA shares in four different accounts 🤦🏽‍♂️🥃

Have a boat load of money and get into pre ipo investing. I want to do it too..
Can someone explain something to me because I’m confused. Let’s say a stock is trading at $99. What is the downside of buying 100 shares and then selling a call 30 days out at a strike price of $100. The premium will probably be large and there’s a good chance the call will expire in the money, so you’d just collect the large premium for free? What am I misunderstanding?

>Then we drove by another one on the way home in a strip mall and I looked in as we drove by and there was literally 0 people in there while the parking lot was completely full of cars.

>I get they have digital sales... but... after seeing that there is no way I'm touching it.

>If you guys manage to make more money off of it then I'm happy for ya.

Compare [this](https://youtu.be/NUYvbT6vTPs) to [this](https://youtu.be/7yh9i0PAjck) to [this](https://youtu.be/ZjDZrReZ4EI). The similarities and differences are obvious. Notice how the singing sounds nothing like the original Finnish but very similar to the Miku version. Especially notice how 0:35 to 0:45 in the Turkish video is clearly adapted from 1:31 to 1:40 in the Hatsune Miku version and is nowhere to be found in the original song.

Wikipedia would never cite this, because it counts as original research, but I think the influences are pretty obvious.

If they want to screw with people, they should push it up a little over $36 on Monday then have it drop to like $27 and let it bounce to pick up a bunch of dip buyers, then let it tank to just below $20 to trigger a ton of stop losses then moon again.
So a slower demise than Blockbuster. With a ^^^^^hopefull potential comeback if they can somehow? find a niche or squeeze themselves as the middleman for digital sales? Because that's only way I see them surviving and making a comeback.

Totally possible. Just highly unlikely but maybe they can. Who knows. I just buy calls and pray

Get a 30 yr fixed at 2.9%. Opportunity cost of capital tied up in the house, it is a no-brainer. Reinvest funds in low risk etfs for 7-8% a year, this will net around 5% compounded annually on the $400k compared to buying in cash. If you want to move, find suitable people to rent and cover monthly payments with rent and finance a new home. Or, you can always pay off the mortgage early if something comes up. Buying in cash in this rate environment is foolish.

But just to add some rough basic context (I'm retarded so I only have basic context to give lol), it depends on where you are relative to the strike price and where you are relative to the expiration date, among other things like volitility

https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html
Would be good to give you a quick idea. The closer you get to expiry, the less OUT OF THE MONEY (OTM) (<strike for calls and > strike for puts) options will be worth. The more IN THE MONEY (ITM), the more it's worth and eventually it becomes equal to just 100 shares *(curr price - strike price).
Nice work - I had been averaging down since Thursday, when I thought $20.50 was a great price lol. Bought all the way down on Friday, and managed to get an average price just under $20. I was *sure* it was going to rally into the close, but it just kept dropping. Oh well, if it hits $30 within the next couple of months, I'll be ecstatic.

Tesla stopping production of Model S and X’s from December 24th to January 11th... Puts
TWO YEARS after Target launched its $6bn operation in Canada, they decided to close the entire Canadian operation for a quarterly loss of $5.4 BILLION. The management team decided to close unprofitable locations and focus more towards online sales and their locations in the US. (Sounds like GME right now, especially what Ryan Cohen is saying)

"Target said exiting Canada would allow it to focus resources on the U.S. market. It also RAISED its estimate for adjusted earnings per share in the quarter to $1.43 to $1.47, an upward revision of 6 cents."
Doubters had their say of course. "The failure in Canada raises serious doubts about the retailer’s long-term growth prospects"

In 2015 the share price was $75 when they took the huge loss. Currently TGT is trading at ATH $172, up 2.5x

GME doubters will have their say, comparing the closures to Blockbuster, (just like you did now) but case studies have proven that store closures can be extremely bullish like in the case for TGT. GME made a bad business move in Europe. If they close those stores and sell off the EU assets they can generate lots of capital to fund their digital growth and protect themselves against losses. GME is not a dying brand. It ranked #5 on the website shoppers intend to make purchases for the holidays. Tell me how a dying brand ranks so high. Look at the link below and see who GME ranks higher up than.

Ohlhhhhhhh ok so actually. Check with your broker but most likely you can sell your options after market close, or the broker will sell them for you. I have etrade and robinhood, so etrade allows me to sell those options after market close so if they spike I win, and robinhood sells them as well for you. But "1 hpur before market close". So i might ditch robinhood just incase.so i think there is no chance  that the fallsndont profit, hut i also wpuodnt buy super OTM calls because of the iv crush.

I dont see how the market van physically price on 80b worth of buying. Like, they still have to BUY the shares. Thats 80b worth of shares being taken off the marke, which will surely result in a price explosion. The same way a stock dilution dilutes the shares.
With a headline like that I’m sure it’s gonna be 50$ by the end of January. Stocks have nothing to do with reality the prices of stocks are determined by buyers and sellers regardless of how a company is doing financially it’s a ponzi lmao 😂

Absolutely agree. Musk never fucked a pigeon.
Taking peak value in 1994 and him investing there, would have been 1666 shares at a then price of $60 (adjusted price of 0.386). Based on splits (2x - 2000, 2x - 2005, 7x - 2014, 4x - 2020) if he never sold he would have 186666 shares at a value of $22.85 Million.

Let's say he got in at the lowest point or $31.08, that is 3217 shares. After splits that is 360,304 shares and a value of 44.1M.

I'm not going through the exercise of if he did a DRIP (because this is Forest you know he did). But you are looking at a rough 1.5% increase in share count YoY since 2013 it would be adjust to be about 717k shares or a value of 87.87M

This lines up with the stock return of \~21080% return since inception. 

Ending point, Rovell sucks at math.

Ok sure. For every buyer there’s a seller. So I guess if there’s a massive amount of buying for the indexes which everyone knows there will be then technically you’re right. There will be a massive buying spree and selling dump occurring at the same time. All that matters here is the push pull on bid/ask. So indexes buy in hard prices go up. They’ve bought from the sellers willing to sell to take profit or from the market makers. After all that churns out you really think there’ll be a significant cohort of sellers rushing to sell at lower prices to get out ASAP for profit taking alone? There will have to be some other impetus for a large sell off than just profit taking.

You realize 99% of "unusual options activity", are mutual funds / pension funds hedging portfolio holdings. This is extremely common around Q4 earnings, as funds want to secure gains, but mainly restructure funds to more closely align with the prospectus before holdings disclosure at year end. Also, PLTR Q4 and lockup expiration is around the corner so expect even more unusual activity. None of this is evidence of a particular move up or down.

You're asking about essentially a random event. "Expected" gains and losses aren't real. You can expect things to go up, or down. But you can't really guess how much.

So put $500. Lose it all. Double it. Triple it. Turn it into $50,000. Turn it into $501. Turn it into $499. No one can answer that. If they could tell you exactly what you'll be getting back they wouldn't be posting in this sub haha they'd be the wealthiest person in history.

No, still puts; never changed. Just the timing has. My initial position was too early. 

I wasn’t fazed by it’s run-up to it’s ATH, I knew this stock was full of speculation, but I underestimated how much speculation there actually was/is. 

It was interesting how Cramer said it was way over valued and it took a 16% dive on Friday. I think that’s just the beginning.

Hypothetically, if Tesla retracts back to a more reasonable value, let's say 200, how many years will it take for you to even break even? Tesla might recover from such a dip, but if it takes 10 years like with Amazon, you could've probably made better money putting it into an ETF.

It's not going up but may consolidate.

The bear case is that it's hot dogshit and they told you as much last week
I disagree. Everyone knows the upcoming holidays are always very much in favor of amazon. Opening up and people getting vaccined surely will make people shop in the streets again, but i feel like this will only reduce growth of revenue by a bit. Besides, things arent opening up yet. By the time plenty of people have gotten the vaccine to be actually noticed, were going to be alot further in 2021. Adding that theres still theories on  the vaccine not even reducing spread of the disease, just stopping it in one person wich validate my theory even further
Can't believe that boomer stock is one of my wife's best performer.

I had some thoughts on this and all my friends for months now have been saying everyone is leaving cities and moving to the middle of nowhere.  So this means you are right.  5 years of these people out in the middle of nowhere they will go stir crazy.   Everyone is already stir crazy.  20’s are back!  Its going to be huge.  Alcohol, weed, sex, parties, all coming back and people are going to over due it.

These stores where unprofitable because of their delivery logistics,  they could not keep shelves stocked using their cross border delivery plan.  

They bought out a true Canadian company (Zellers) and tried to use their big box branding to replace them,  but failed.  Pissing of a bunch of Canadians is a good way to lose business. 

It was not a dying brand like GameStop or Blockbuster,  it was just a bad business move.
That run up after the initial pop is retail investors chasing.  The drop after was institutions selling.   Your thesis works well for next year.  Buy into it.  Not after it

!remindme 3 months
The "no" was to the 10% of their market cap part not the 5 billion. Yes it was 5 billion, no it wasnt 10% of their market cap. I should have been more clear!
who the hell calls 3 months "3m" instead of "3mo"

Also, wtf are you talking about? Their IPO was in September, what is the time frame you're using, daily, hourly? Your comment is so fucked up it makes literally no sense
Because there is long(er) term data, with the initial covid cases. Lots of respiratory and cardiac issues, even some effects on metal health

Lol.  

Revenue is not the same as profit.  They are closing unprofitable stores.  

The consoles are supplied by the manufacturers, so closing stores has zero effect on the total supply gamestop has as a whole.

One of my favorite of all time is this excerpt:

And how can man die better 
than facing fearful odds, 
for the ashes of his fathers 
and the temples of his Gods?

You’re pretty fucking dumb if you think reinvesting all profits is the same as being unprofitable.

Would love to but it'd bring my option power to negative for whatever reason.  I really don't understand how TDA works with what it considers funds and not, because it says I have $5,000 of stock buying power but it doesn't apply that to a CSP.  Frustrating.  I even have margin on the account and it's not utilized but it doesn't seem to reflect on ToS.
-   A WSB CHRISTMAS CAROL   - 

There once was a spac called BFT

I pointed it out so all WSB could see

Some said fuck you and I said fuck me?

Then I doubled down cuz that’s how I be

Eventually tendies started raining like hos in the street

And my pockets were bulging for all who can see

They said where those stacks come from and I said BFT

They said why didn’t you tell me and how you get so lucky?

Then I said fuck you and they said fuck me?

And then it started raining tendies AGAIN like dem sneaky hos in the street

I said god damn and thank you motha fuckin BFT!

You made my day, my year, hell yeah WSB!!!

0:56 put some money into SPACs. Man was ahead of his time!
Wow, you really have no idea how options work.

If the strike is $3150 and each option costs $200, Amazon has to make it to $3350 in 2.5 months for him to even break even. Not $3200...

For him to make $5K per option like you said, Amazon has to go to $3400.

The dude could easily lose all 3.5 million if Amazon ends below $3150, which is pretty easily possible.
There could be something with that, but I’m looking for a little longer form
Don’t wanna be there when that bubble pops...

I think your wrong. Hence, the post. But we shall see!
There is that point housing prices will become to expensive that it becomes unforable for the middle class, but I'm really pessimistic so I think what we may see capital outflow from assets or bond to land. 


Its cool that houses are expensive but you if are a fund of some sort you can still buy up these homes, set the rent prices to recoup losses, and there is still a supply side housing problem. I mean most investors see value in investing in these rental reits. Either way people have to live somewhere and our options are extremely limited in the US .



I hope im fucking wrong, cuz this is depressing

Fair enough. That said, there’s no reason to deregulate or privatize in order to sell wind and solar to the energy utility. If you want my opinion, privatization and deregulation only make sense in places where there are natural markets. With an energy utility there is no market. It’s one company using the one set of power lines connected to your home. So all you’re doing is giving us the same incompetent monopoly we always had with government but now you’re adding a 20% profit margin to it for no reason that everybody has to pay.

The TSLA stock split was the ultimate power move. I dont think the current price would have been possible without it. Yes, sure, there is just more shares now and the market cap is the same. But calls are also about 5 times cheaper now and you couldn't sustain a gamma squeeze without that.

Telsa is like 10% of the fund. and Tesla has gone up 7.4x in the past year. ARKK has gone up 1.5x in the past year. I think at least 50% of the gain in ARKK is attributable to Tesla. So if you take out Tesla, thats a respectable 75% gain if my math is correct.

Why do you care? If you think it's going down don't hop on the ship.  You'll either be right or wrong but neither side knows right now. Acting like you know what is going to happen makes you look dumb. 

Also, calling it "Blockbuster" isn't a compelling argument to us "bag holders" that have heard that comparison a hundred times before.  We obviously see something else here, whether rightfully or not. If you don't see it the same, best of luck on whatever you choose to invest in instead. Jeeze.
Not really. There’s a lot of libtards in this sub which isn’t really surprising when you remember most people here have accounts worth a couple hundred bucks.

I don’t need to look at 1999.  DoorDash, a food delivery business, just IPO’ed. Their valuation is more insane than anything seen before. There is also AirBnB...even the founder was shocked when the price shot up. It’s a rental exchange site. 

Yes, it’s likely this will pop. The question at this point is about the ones that will survive. Which ones have real value.
Fcuk,  I sold that shit at 40 bucks.   Imagine Buying 10 leaps back then

Sound advice. Don’t invest in risky assets, it’s like play the lotto... only with mutual funds and take all the money and pay off a $500k house with cash when you can borrow at 2.5-3%. 
What a fucking moron.
The fuck is wrong with you. They were purposely causing power outages to make rates skyrocket on poor people. In Texas. In august. There are audio recordings of their energy traders on the phone laughing about it. 

You can already install solar panels on your own land and sell the energy back into the grid. You don’t need a bunch of criminals to do that.

Dude China uses govt dollars everywhere possible to corner markets so Chinese can prosper.  So they will subsidize some companies till all competition is bankrupt. Then they raise prices.

They steal all IP everywhere all the time.

Its a shitty country.

They will fail long term due lack of actual innovation, because when you steal and cheat you become complacent and dumb.

I’d argue the CIA should launch an effort to give them garbage IP so they spend countless dollars on fake nonsense that doesn’t work.  USA did that to Russia a bunch during cold war.
So many people say that

I agree for the most part but I definitely have seen patients scanned for super fucking obvious diagnoses just for the sake of billing more. There's also the shift towards medicine from a clinical specialty (aka making the diagnosis based off patient symptoms and presentation) to biochemical and radiologic diagnoses. These new ER docs basically can't diagnose a cold without running 50 tests.

$180,575 at risk. Making a guess that IV on OTM calls dips from 200% to 150% and that the underlying moves to $30 from $32, then this greedy bitch will have $45k left at open.

UPDATE: Estimating that he got out with around $18,800 after SPCE gapped down to $27 and IV fell to 140%.

GUHPDATE 2: According to the degen himself he took a 153k loss, would have left him with 27k.

And my life is not something that i'd fear a lot of destruction in. I work a lot anyway and have various side projects and ambitions and lots of ups and downs. 

So I guess since you offered to give advice-- am I too old?

you are vastly uneducated on this matter.

Who do you think will cheat more? 

Obviously the side with more options will be the one who is more likely to cheat.

In this day and age of where women have an army of simps ready to sleep with them just because they are women, they are much more likely to cheat than men.

On the other hand if men had so many women throwing themselves at them, they would cheat just as much, but that just isn’t the case.

The average man does not have get the insane amount of attention from the other sex as the average women does.

So obviously statistically it would be the women who would cheat more since she has the most options to on average.

Remember that all girls are human and humans have six desires and seven emotions. Don’t put them on a pedestal brother.

Because the doctors good enough to diagnose from a single scan don't practice, they push paper. The doctors who actually deal with patients are just dodging malpractice suits and passing the bill on to the patient because the hospital's board of directors finds that more efficient.

"It has the potential"

"Don't forget that, while volatile, tech and Internet stocks these days have among the highest growth potential on the market. Being overly cautious may help you sleep at night, but it won't do much for your long-term investment goals"

"As Cullen suggested, communications companies show no signs of slowing down -- as epitomized by the year-end blast-off of Qualcomm."
    On a year-to-date basis, communications firms on the S&P 1500 index rose 22.5 percent, while cellular and wireless firms in that category rocketed 210.4 percent.
    "We see wireless voice and data businesses as the future," she said. "It's an exciting theme and the market certainly looks like it's got a lot of life to go."

Take a guess from which year that is.

If I could read I’d probably be mad at this.
I dont know if Degiro is fucking me or if there is a reason behind this but somehow all my stock positions show different kind of currency losses (%). 

For example today, with most stocks I‘m down about -0.02% but somehow with PLTR my currency loss is -0.22%. I‘ve also noticed that on certain positions i have a bigger unrealized % currency P/L despite having bought it at a later point. For example I bought DKNG in november but the position has a bigger unrealized currency loss than the stocks i bought in May/June which doesnt make sense at all.

For clarification I‘m from switzerland and all my positions are shown in CHF. Does anyone have similar problems?

Ah the ol ag exemption! Good strategy but its gonna take you some time to acquire that status unless you've already bought the land and applied with proof of your ag units. Dairy cows are also not very easy to break into. You have to keep those heifers fat, keep the hormones high while keeping them relaxed, regular vaccines, antibiotics, anti-parasitics, etc. Not to mention you better be ready to open a baby cow meat shop to sell those babies like hotcakes! May I suggest a different ag unit?

Businesses are amoral. People that demand ethics and morality in businesses are barking up the wrong tree. Also, hypocritically, given the chance most people would pick money over ethics. That's just human nature.

lol not even SPCE. You heard it here
And unemployment benefits which were huge. The vaccine is going to take a while to distribute to the population at large. The least that the gov’t can do in the meantime / before the holidays is a “gesture” for the people even if it doesn’t impact our lives directly. If they don’t actually pass another stimulus, the possibility of one will prevent the markets from seriously selling off.

There's also a possibility she'll die just short of if there's no money left by then.
I havent followed, but last time i looked at it ( a really long time ago ), the prices were driven by not lack of supply of trees, but the mills had reduced capacity.



Also huge amounts of demand for new homes to, which Im sure is not gonna go away.


But I would gamble and say that demand for new home will increase in Feb/March and builders and suppliers will still have huge amounts of demand and supply will still struggle to keep up.

but im retarded so take it with a grain of sand.

I remember back when I started investing and bought JCPenny because it was beat down and thought it would eventually recover.  I would read message boards where people said things like "they are only closing underperforming stores. this is good news."  God I was pretty dumb back then.
I’d assume potential growth. Amazon, target and Walmart were like the only businesses open for several months so potentially all of their completion is already bankrupt. I don’t shop at Target nor own their stock but it definitely has a huge customer base; it’s kind’ve like a $Becky stock tbh I used to see white girls tweet about going on dates there

Where is the inflation?
It's definitely crossed my mind, but I can't argue with the studies/data they've put out. Having worked in a couple research settings before, I can tell you for a fucking fact that unless there's enough incentive, nothing gets done.

I'm almost certain that over the past 5 years, these scientists would've squeezed every single penny out of it by publishing a couple menial articles every couple months and getting more funding. When a substantial amount of money was put into acquiring results, you can bet your ass these companies hired an army of scientists to work overtime to be the first one to market.

We had been rocky for a while. Having 5 kids and me never being there and at work. Probably a large contribution. But seems we grew apart. 
When we met our first date was to the church which she really thought was special because I was a street hooligans then but I was trying to get my life right at the time. I was 19. We were married for ten years. 
But we were a interracial couple me white her black. With all the racism that has been in the news helped to destabilize our marriage. About 5 years ago we both agreed that we didn’t believe any more in god or the Bible. Well she remained like that I decided that after not believing the years of 2016-2019 and living in Los Angeles I wanted something different for my life. 
Once I told her I was choosing a life of trying to reconnect back with god and wanted to follow the lifestyle of the Bible, she wanted no part. 
To this day my x is into witchcraft, magic, crystals, holistic healing and the likes as well as turning gay.
She actually despises the fact I attempt at teaching our 5 kids about the Bible. 
To put a spin on in it. I am actually a believer in black Hebrew people as the core race of the Bible. I do not believe in white, britih isrealism. Ive believe Jesus was black as well as his people  since I met my wife originally. 
But in her mind they have created a white Jesus, a fake religion to undermine the history of black people and doesn’t want to hear nothing I got to say.

One controller for the PS4, one for PS3 since the beginning, one for the PS2 also from the beginning (19 years ago), and even the PSP is good but the battery is fucked but that’s nothing I can do with that. Besides cleaning they are all work like a charm with no problems. I even had my computer for over 10 years and besides a few replacements it can still go on for a few more years. I have 4 phones since I got it in high school and they all still work. Electronics are the ones I take the most priority. I’ve owned 3 sunglasses and I lost 2 of them bitches lmfao
WSB is an oasis in the shit abyss Ricky

If I get banned, so be it. Aren't you all at least a little bit curious to see how this plays out?
Does anyone here track lumber futures? Or work in the industry? The increase has to be a short squeeze followed by a huge dump similar to Aug/Sept
Lots of buying to cover. Like all these quad and triple witches, contracts will be covered Monday-Wednesday, and not Thursday-Friday.

You could say the same about the people who bought at $1500 pre-split (I sold out at $450 pre-split). For perspective, Tesla would be worth $3000 now if it weren't for the split
Ahh the memes
I hold Village Farms shares at $5.05. There are Canadian LP's that have, or will have, access to US markets in the event of certain state, or full federal legalisation. Do your DD.

I would only consider Aphria and Village Farms in Canada as LP's ... and not at current prices. I do think there will be a lull before Q4 earnings. I wish I could say how low it would go but i'll average Village Farms up at around $8.00 to put my mark to $6.00 ... will sell up more close to earnings if I don't see it drop further before then.

I'd be looking as low as $6.00 for Aphria for entry, so unfortunately I think i'll have to buy after earnings don't beat the hype. Long term is good but let it come to you.

From the research I have done over the past 8 months, I would agree with others here that US MSO's are going to provide a much faster return on an investment at near current price points, if you can access them.

For now I am stuck with the access I have and so Canadian LP's are my only access. You can gamble to fuck out of the penny stocks if you want but ... yeesh it's ugly. I'd wait until after earnings and nearly everything shits itself. Get those dates in your diary. Sundial is fucking solid for this if you have the patience to wait to buy low and also the stones to hold medium term.

Moon landing is a waaaay off you those of you in Tilray, Aurora, Cronos, I think. Too many losses. Too much share dilution. Too much inventory. Not enough outlet. Not enough innovation.
The aquifers in middle America drying up are only like half the conversation. If you’re looking for some nap time reading, go check out “the source” and read about how the Colorado river compact was negotiated based on one of the wettest periods in history. That means the whole thing is based on like 16M acre feet of flow, but we typically get like 12M. Inbound water fighting and political shitshow. If you’re a senior rights holder you could be fine, but AZ and some places are in a perilous situation.

Versus 15k cycles in the lab for the Tesla battery in development. It similarly doesn't hit end of life at that point, but I don't recall the efficiency number.

We don't need 2 million miles for the car, but to allow the battery to find a second life.

Good luck. I felt like I needed a shower and to hug my dog after the last time I went down that one
It’s up 46% this Month. What more do you want?
Yeah, just trying to figure out the best way to play. Relatively new to the game so only got around 4K to blow. This would therefore enable me to get 2 close to the money TSLA weeklies, or just 1 for 12/24. I know the contracts fluctuate with volatility, timing, etc, but for every dollar the stock goes up, what's the average expected return on a single contract like the 12/24?
Haha no issues. I thought you were trolling. Happy trading!

If a brand new company started up with the desire to dominate this industry via E-commerce everyone would be on board. Instead of starting a new company, Ryan Cohen picked gamestop due to its incredible recent Financials to do this. Even Amazon invested in brick and mortar... There is a future here and getting rid of the old focus solely on brick and mortar is essential. But they are cash heavy, on the verge of profitability, and will be able to finance the move to e-commerce. This is becoming a completely new company. This article is an attempt to help the shorts. The reality is, GME doesn't have to grow to be worth its current market value, it just has to stop bleeding as much through the unprofitable stores which is why they are closing the losers. Now if they start growing which is their new focus "digital first" then this becomes an incredibly cheap growth tech stock that doesn't need to raise money because it is already able to self finance.
And then there's some entry level job at a start up that gets paid millions when their company goes IPO

A sweep is typically a large order that is broken into a number of different smaller orders that can then be filled more quickly on multiple exchanges. A sweep order instructs your broker to identify the best prices on the market, regardless of offer size, and fill your order piece-by-piece until the entire order has been filled.

80% efficiency after 800 charge cycles, which if you assume they'll put in enough cells to hit 500km range to match existing ice ranges would be 400k. But that's 400k before you've lost some efficiency not end of life. 

800 is easily good enough to mean the battery is likely to last longer than the vehicle, and not many ices will make it to 400k either.

Of the option flows friday, it looks like Melvin capital closed out their July 15p position of 54k contracts (for 34m), and opened up a jan 22 21 15p position of 13m (cant remember how many). Tells me they no longer see a longterm bearish prospect. Seems they still think there is short term pain, but these fuckers were wrong before and im pretty sure they lost about 30% on their original put position unless IV helped them pull out gains
Edit: friday not saturday

Same was going to happen if we did pass stimulus in august.
But the number of people dying this year isn’t any higher than any other year. It’s exactly the same as last year.  The death rate in 2019 was %1.20. Exact same in 2020. And that’s down from %1.22 in 2018

So yes. COVID “killed” 300k people.  But apparently all the other causes of death decreased.

Most important part of this is recognizing when to just eat the loss. Stubborness can cause you to bleed money when you shouldn't. If your play is down 50% and the event you were planning on going your way has passed don't hope for some miracle reversal the next day.

Selling before it goes to zero is a profitable decision even if the overall move is a loss. Every time you look at a position is a new decision point -- hold or sell. Ignore what's happened since you bought the position. Every time you look at a position and hold you're buying it all over again. Don't compound mistakes with more mistakes. When you notice something's gone wrong don't make it worse by letting the rest burn off. I've let many thousands go making that mistake.

Maximize gains but minimize losses.

Here are my opinion and here me clearly 

I have two scenarios so far 

1) these gay analyst might shit on Tesla to cause a fall down to $540 more then raise their PT to 800 or $900 so that they can buy a yacht and to have three some with their wives and mistresses. 

2) there may not be enough share to sell the indexers which might cause Tesla to spike up to $700 before inclusion and $1000 after inclusion. Then around Dec 22-23rd it might go down to 740 


That’s all I got for now but I definitely believe that it will go back up in Jan
Fucking cool, love to hear it!

Well if you have $1mil cash on hand you can wheel TSLA/AMZN for the foreseeable future.

Based on last prices at close on Friday you could sell 14 TSLA 600p for 12/18 for about 50k. As long as TSLA is the volatile crazy stock it is for the foreseeable future it doesn't even matter if it tanks to like 400 and you get exercised. Sell almost ITM calls next week for probably the same amount.

40-60k a week for life seems pretty good, yeah?

Yes you are right. There's no stopping current gas fleets to switch to EV fleets. But in the near to mid term, it would make little economic sense due to the huge capital expenditure and overhead costs, unless EV retrofitting technology is ready to replace ICE to EV. But EV retrofitting is still fairly nascent and would not be ready for mass production until the near future.

Until then, ELMS' manufacturing plant will be pumping and scaling their EV vehicles and operations. A more likely outcome for gas fleet companies would be to work with ELMS instead and switch to their vehicles = more b2b deals.
What if you're maxed out there?
Leave bro. It's not worth it. Go back to community College or something if necessary but get out asap

A few week ago I said there would be efforts on the part of TSLA to bring the price down before the inclusion.

Always think like the big boys. When the markets are rising, think like the big investors. Helps make you decide whether the markets will continue rising or drop soon.
Also as you said that you are better with trending markets: 99% of successful traders are trend followers

If you can control yourself to focus on great trend following and work on your exits and entries you are definitely on a great way.. Just learn that the stock market will be open tomorrow and next month, there is no need to get chopped into pieces with all the retail traders, just take a day off if it's that bad

Bad advice.

GME is great if you're theta gang. Buy commons, sell CC against them. Generate huge returns p.a with little risk considering it's trading at such a low valuation right now. Will be hard to tank the stock further considering they are returning to profitability this quarter. Easy money to be made here.

Newb retard question.

Isn’t selling covered calls kinda boring? I mean if you sell a call expiring in 30 days that essentially locks you in as far as your 100 shares go for at least 30 days, and puts you under contract to the buyer so now you’re completely on their timeframe.

I guess I’m just used to making at least 3-5 trades a week due to FOMO and the enjoyment of losing money.
Whatever your risk tolerance is and whether you want to own the stock or not. If you’re bullish go for higher premium. But sure, “the wheel”. Shit works when done right and can be done weekly for easy Tendies.

We're easily several months away from seeing changes to positivity rates among the general population. So you're asking what happens to the market in late 2021. No one knows.

With the efficacy rates of the vaccines coming out it would be insane for positivity rates to not go down considerably over time once a decent amount of the gen pop are vaccinated. Would probably mark the greatest scientific/medical failure of all time.

I always tell people to spend time with their pets, enjoy them, play with them, shower them with attention. You are their entire world for such a short amount of time and you don’t want to look back regretting not going on that walk, or playing, or just sitting with them because you had to rush to go out with friends or do other shit you have a lifetime to do. Yes, you can get another dog, cat, or whatever, but they will never be the exact one you had. Pets are family. When my pup starting getting old i began to prepare myself and really showered her with as much attention as i could. It’s a part of life, but still really sucks. Awesome of you to see it though, man. I hope you and your pupper continue a long and healthy life together.

Works whenever you have a new world changing global pandemic. You basically can’t lose.
Just a tip from a semi professional full-time trader:

Invest in a good analyzing software like Edgewonk for example, you are making great profits but considering that you don't know the bare minimum of your Key performance indicators you might be in for a bad surprise

Constantly profitable Trading is not really about a talent but more about knowing yourself and challenging yourself over and over again to become a better trader... And being a good trader isn't determined by your profits but by your risk reward ratio and your emotions

If you try to increase those 4 to 8 key performance indicators your performance will skyrocket anyway.

Most people just focus on performance.. But since 90% of traders are losing money with that attitude.. Yeah.. I think I made my point

It looks like it’s mostly due to a refresh coming, but media will spin it as low demand.
I tend to focus on ORB, break outs or break downs of key levels, and trend continuation patterns.  So a stock in an uptrend you wait for a pullback and wait for the pullback to bounce back towards the old high.  Ideally near the MA. Disney on Friday was great example of this trade when it went from 171 to 178.  Multiple buy spots along the way up.  But you have to identify a stock that has some sort of catalyst for the move.  Any old stock without some sort of news or reason for it to go up or down your just jerking off algos and trading with the spy or Nasdaq which often times lately aren't doing a whole lot.  I traded the spy and qqq back in March as it was basically moving every stock so there wasn't a whole lot of point in trading individual stocks in March.  Now I don't touch either for day trades as the moves are so back and forth it's hard to ever say it's trending.

GME stands zero chance of recovery. For $20 per month Microsoft will send you a brand new Xbox. The $20 includes Xbox Game pass and Xbox live. Plus a piece of the $20 is a 0 interest loan so you own it after two years.  

PS5 won't be far behind if they don't already have something like this. The industry is moving to the monthly subscriber model and all games are purchased digitally now. You can even gift people digital games in the Microsoft store. GME was a brick and mortar distributor and existed to help fill a gap that doesn't exist anymore. 

They literally bring no value to the market. Guaranteed to crumble into a niche retro gaming website. You are all fucking stupid.

He’s looking at option chains during the weekend and you can’t get into those prices. Come Pre mkt and by the open when you can get your order in, those prices are already higher. You can’t just pick things that look nice during non trading hours and expect that exact entry point. He’s saying he wants to buy calls after they have already moved up. The call values move up already.

It’s not like he would lose money if his calls were assigned, just wouldn’t be able to get premium forever off those shares. He can always do it again.

I know you're a huge GME troll who comments on every thread calling this a pump and dump. Obviously you can't read a chart for shit. Pump and dumps dont last months and they don't retest support lines with Higher Lows. I know your brain is too small to interpret a 300% rise in a year as anything else, but at least try.

If you got far enough down on the article (doubtful cause you can't read) you would have found this line:

"We anticipate, for the first time in many quarters, that the fourth quarter will include positive year-on-year sales growth and profitability, reflecting the introduction of new gaming consoles, our elevated omni-channel capabilities and continued benefits from our cost and efficiency initiatives, even with the potential further negative impacts on our operations due to the global COVID-19 pandemic,"

I'm sure Blockbuster was posting profitable quarters and prepaying debt early just before they collapsed.... Oh, no, wait, they didn't. They didn't bother making a pivot either, and that is just what this article tries so very hard not to highlight. There are bearish articles everywhere. Only retards who can't think for themselves spout the nonsense you do in every GME post. Shut the fuck up kid and move on or post your short position.
Yeah well. Two great timing trades. Now ask me how much I lost on PLTR and LAZR Lolol. Worst timing ever for me

If I would be speaking to serious traders then I would say that you should not trade in extreme situations, that the sentiment is way to bullish since weeks, that statistically speaking most stocks pull down after getting into the S&P and that you never know what musk is going to Twitter tomorrow..

I just use options as a way to day trade the stock instead of using stock.  The options are just more leveraged than what I can get even with 400k worth of tsla.  So I'm basing my buys and sells on whatever the stock does.

I literally just started to choke on my morning coffee from just reading this guys post and getting the vibes that he's absolutely serious! In another post a few weeks ago I even said that within 6-12mnths PLTR will probably be $180-200 and this is a stock that should most be definitely held and the waves rode!

I do a fundamental filter first, then technical for entires. A company can be great, but if its gonna go “to da moon” it needs energy (vol) and a new ATH (advance) to do so. These are actionable ideas this week. Not next year, or month. This week. I love technicals. Whole reason I posted was to spread the info.

If you are feeling ballsy $CBDD is a decent play. Trading around .01 but should be at .05 - .10 based off the earning reports. Of course you need real broker to trade it. Can't use RH.
Exactly. I’m In Los Angeles and also a retard. I’ve been right about everything to do with Covid since May. It’s amazing how many Americans willfully buried their head in the sand about the dark winter. So many businesses didn’t prepare and now just want to blame the government for everything. 

The government did fuck up massively literally the entire time but at this point we need stimulus, a marketing plan and a massive culture change. So basically we fukt.
How cold? Running gloves and a running hat are key to me. I always run in shorts so I have calf sleeves to keep legs warm. Up top, long sleeve with a light hoodie over it. Should be warm-ish after the first mile

Election week...I put in a market order for arkg that never filled, at around 69per. Luckily for me, though, I did put additional monies that same day in arkk and arkw that did fill. 

Last Wednesday, though, when things dropped bigly in afternoon, I saw arkg down overall across the past two/three days AND 5ish percent for that specific day and ordered—nice little deal. I filled at 91. 

CRISPR is real deal—there was an Uber popular gif recently of the tech “cutting out” a diseased gene...with just a little snip, snip, you or your child’s hereditary disease can be eliminated. It is not mainstream right now obviously, but it will be. 

Little tip: arkf is rolling and still relatively cheap.

Not too much on FDs.  More like near the money or at the money.  In the money and the spreads go too wide.
$SPCE is going to go up on Monday. Just because you're panic selling your 6 shares over something that you don't understand does not mean that their stock is going to fall. A statement was made, and it shows nothing but promise for the future.

What.
My mom worked for a financial advisor. What she would say is that it depends on what point in your life your father is at. If he had been investing at your age, then he can afford to take risks early and should shift to more stable investments at retirement age etc. 

Maybe you should sit down with your dad and make sure he understands the risks of trading like you. Also it might be a good idea to diversify his money once you’ve made decent gains so you never feel bad about losing money cause he’ll still be up something.

For instance if you can make gains like 100% returns, maybe put half into something stable and half to continue the growth.

Just something to think about since nobody wants to lose their parents money and he’s probably had it hard enough.

On an aggregate scale I think we're around market average but the winners are far separated from the losers.

You can also see graphs I'd the inflation during that era. It had its steepest slope and upward movement before the oil crisis. 

I also didn't point out what I posted out to be categorically antiunion. The government policy of full employment was a bigger problem. Basically if workers can infinitely demand higher wages because there's just another job waiting for them around the corner, that drives up the costs companies have to charge for their goods and services, which eventually creates inflation.

GME just prepaid debt early last week. They have 300m left in notes and will have no issues with paying it off. The notes are trading over par. I know you don't know what that means but essentially the bond market fully trusts GMEs ability to pay it's debt.
You don't go bankrupt without debt. That was not the case with Blockbuster.

GME has been called Blockbuster for over 10 years now. Your comment is unoriginal. Christ you think store closures are bearish. Its improving their bottom line and moving the business to e-commerce. That is how they survive. Maybe learn to read financial statements before offering advice on stocks you mongloid. Don't say I didn't want you.

I don't understand this in general.. Just because you are bearish or bullish in your analysis you don't need to be positioned in the market.

Might as well just seeing a trend and being bullish but the setup is not good enough to invest money in it.. Or you want to wait on a specific daily close

I have about 10 markets where I am bullish or bearish without a position yet because I wait on a confirmation of my initial thought or the market is just not a 5 star setup but just a meh.. 60% or 55% bullish setup

Bullish. Blind person could’ve seen this coming, “smart” Wall Street mega brains will have priced this in. Also, this primarily hurts small ships in cities that aren’t publicly traded. More business for the bigger fish, thus markets will go up.

It's called [guanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi).

*In mainland China, terms like guanxi practice or la guanxi are used to refer to bribery and corruption.  Guanxi practice is commonly employed by favour seekers to seek corrupt benefits from power-holders. Guanxi offers an efficient information transmission channel to help guanxi members to identify potential and trustworthy partners; it also offers safe and secret platform for illegal transactions. Guanxi norms help buyers and sellers of corrupt benefits justify and rationalize their acts.*

Probably because of the exchange it's on. Alot of people don't even consider trading companies on the OTC/CSE/NEO.  Halo also does not see alot of volume. 

Personaly, my top pick for a multi state opporater would be Cresco labs, green thumb industries, and Cura leaf.

Halo is pretty legit though, and they are a small cap with alot of potential upside. If you go to r/weedstocks, you will see shit on halo from time to time.

Edit. My research on halo is a bit outdated, I have not followed them for about a year.so please do your own DD.

I’m not convinced VIX isn’t just directionally opposite of SPY. 

Is there evidence this number is based on actual science somewhere ?

For example. I feel like I can determine how the market is doing just by if SPY is going up or down. 

Why do we need the VIX number which seems to just opposite SPY?  Am I missing something here?

Excellent point. My follow-up is speculation, and has some unknowns in it. 1000 less stores that are not generating a profit is good in my eyes. It could be a multitude of reasons why they are closing however. Anecdotal reply, my city has a population of 200k, we have 3 Gamestops. All spread out, all by different major hubs/shopping centers, none of them have closed through this closure, which makes me assume that the 3 stores we have are doing well, all things considered. Given the opportunity to run a large B&M, cutting expenses and liabilities is a long term, good idea.
Secondly, inventory volume of PS5/XBsX/XBsS. This is the unknown. How does Sony and Microsoft distribute to each store? Is it a set amount, and then the retailer distributes to the location? Or is it "each store open gets 5 consoles per shipment."if its the latter, then its not a good decision, if it the prior example, which is the example I would put money on. Then that just means each store gets more inventory, thus creating more excitement at one store, drawing a larger crowd to buy even more knick-knacks from gme.

You see jpow is printing lots of shit but the indices dropped.
the issue isn't the dollar going low, it's that every other country wants their money to be in a similar place to the dollar.  So they'll try to devalue right alongside the USD.  There will just be a lag affect.

It's actually not as retarded as some of you might have thought. Early this year, after TSLA went from 200 all the way to 900, after it had dropped to 800 in Feb, I threw 200k into TSLA and bought 270 shares. 

Lesson of my story is, no one knows fuck all. If you're lucky you'll triple your money. If not, diamond hand this and Papa Musk will reward you.

Tons of talk about Covid vaccine distribution on the morning news. Not one mention of Palantir. What's up with that?
US covid case reporting is annoying. Like it takes a while to determine a trend.

He bought during a rally on a pullback. TSLA reached it's high PM at $667 or so, and it reached that high on hype. That hype is only going to grow up until the 18th, just like the big run up to *battery day.* I don't think TSLA will stay at whatever high it achieves this week, but it's probable that it surpasses it's last weeks highs.

I bought in early oct (Aark was about 106), 110c 12/18. 

💎✋ Through a crash, sold last week, about 2.5x return. Could have been more, but after it losing a ton I was trimming position as it got closer itm. 

Not yet lost. Have arkf leaps for april right now, 50c.

Ahh there it is... Waited to the final sentence before comparing GME to Blockbuster.

Article had an extremely negative tone on it. Anyways this is not new information, just another silly journo saying GME is in trouble without doing much research. Bearish sentiment still insanely high outside of WSB.

I did a decent amount of outdoor dining in LA until they closed it down. So many people don’t follow the distancing rules and you can’t really eat or drink while wearing a mask so it makes sense that they would become super spreaders. 

I’m just tired of them blaming the governors for everything when they need to be blaming the people who don’t think the virus is real and don’t follow protocols.

Yah but Biden isn’t going to roll back that authorization either. It’s gonna be in place until FDA approval. And now with this rushed emergency authorization it’s gonna look pretty bad if there actually is something off with the vaccine. 

I don’t have much faith in this vaccine honestly and I read that cases are projected to keep going up through April regardless. So it’s a losing battle here at this point.

But does the markets care about anything other than ‘vaccine accomplished’? I imagine at some point we start trying to see what the post COVID economy really looks like.
If it hits 40 I’m happy.

The US economy is largely driven by consumer spending. The last year many consumers were allowed to not pay rent under certain conditions that expires in January. Not only are those bill now going to start being paid of but we could see 40 million evictions starting. 

Those consumers were able to keep spending because of government programs and other moratoriums that are expiring with no replacement income. The market as a whole will not take any of this positively.

They are shooting for a merger either the first or second week of January and they don’t want to do anything around Christmas. 

It could be tomorrow morning or they have been insider trading or open to influences from market makers they may wait until next Monday because the monthly options expire on the 18th.
Bullish. Will my 7/2021 $15c print ? Yes

I've long suspected the normal whites are inheriting money early due to their boomer dad's/grandpa's having 10k shares of m s f t and a p p l from 20 years ago.

Thanks for the post. In just shares atm, don't think options are the right play for me currently. Do you not think the good Q4 earnings are already priced in right now, and would you hold through Q4 earnings or dump it before, in case it dives like it did back with Q3? I think from what we've seen, everything might be pointing towards a positive outlook and then Sherman can just pull something out of his ass and crash the stock again
Escape rooms and axe throwing businesses are fuckin dumb. I have plenty of axes and nobody has escaped my basement so far
It was an anomaly, but COVID is going to get a weird economic thing (if white collar job loss mostly doesn’t happen), people will exit COVID with a strong demand to consume. That doesn’t happen during abnormal recession. People will spend off the charts on vacations and going to bars and eating at their favorite places.

No. 

Read up about decay.

Basically, every loss is multiplied, every gain isn't.

So let's say the stock went up 1 point one day and down 1 point the next, and that cycled every two days... eventually you'd end up on zero, even if the stock is the same price as when you bought.

Multiplies ETFs are short term only. The longer you're in, the more the cards stack against you.

A song that became famous for its catchy and goofy sound during the Napster era gets picked up by a Blind Turkish man with sick drum beats who becomes famous in the YouTube era for covering it, becoming a meme that then gets spliced in with a 2020 Elections meme and a cat meme, plus a deepfake of the President Elect grafted onto the Turkish guy's face, to make a brand new meme about the inevitable collapse of the economy and untold pain and suffering at the hands of the ultra-wealthy.

All to get us to hand out fake internet points to a stranger for amusing us for thirty more seconds.
I'm guessing the absolute bottom would be $400-$450 at the lowest, but more likely $500-$550 or so. But yeah, as a stockholder, sell a few days before (so wednesday/thursday), sell early on friday, sell just before close on friday, or sell just after open on monday.

Agreed. I’m looking at the valuations of companies like DASH, ABNB, SNOW, ZM, etc. and I can’t believe they’re like 5x that of NET in some cases. I’ve loaded up every dip and will continue to do so, I fuckin love this stock. NET will at least double again within the next year I’m sure. They’re literally the future of content distribution and cybersecurity and they don’t even care to get bought out. This company will do big things, I can’t wait until the next few earnings. User growth, revenue growth, paid subscriber growth, etc. are gunna be ridiculous

I think it’s sell the news also this is not an FDA approval, it’s an emergency authorization. 

Basically Tump told the head of FDA approve it or resign. This says more about the current administration than the quality of the vaccine. Things have to be peer reviewed and on a personal note I won’t take this thing until it’s approved by WHO or European Union. 

Also I don’t think FDA had enough time for quality control and to throughly  check facilities for manufacturing.

Pretty sure that was sarcasm
It’s ballsy but not full retard. Index funds have 5 days left to add TSLA and it’s time for the Christmas rally. Last week I bought the dip and sold the rally twice and made about 9% each time.

That's true, people won't freak out, but it happens slowly. 

There are structural reasons for the cycle of recession/depression/revival/boom, happens in every economy.

Cyclical variations..seasonal variations.

The general trend is up for the stock market of countries like the USA, but not for all stock markets.

Media tends to overhype both booms and busts. 

Last dip was pretty much an anomaly. Black Swan Event. You should always buy in such situations, dollar cost average
The stock will do nothing for years. I bet you can get it again at $11 or 12. Long term bullish

Integer overflow isn’t related to the actual price of something, it’s a software bug when you don’t account for the fact that numbers can get longer than can be accounted for in the size of the representation your software is using for integers. It’s very unlikely a stock will be worth as much as can be measured by 64 bits, regardless I’m guessing the nyse accounts for this error but it would be hilarious if they didn’t.
And don't get me wrong, I'm bullish on Tesla, but I'm also long. So I don't mind a tumble because I'm in with a very comfortable price.

"If GameStop takes practical steps to cut its excessive real estate costs and hire the right talent, it will have the resources to begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers.

....

The Company’s average lease duration is approximately 24 months. Now is the time to identify duplicative, underperforming stores and plan to forgo lease renewals.

Every year you can buy all of your local pencils. Just hoard them all, maybe try to convince your wife’s boyfriend they’re edible so that he’ll pat your head like the good old days. You just hold on for that rainy day when every other pencil in the world breaks. If it ever happens then you’re rich, if not you’re no less of a failure than you are right now.

I've seen some 300k homes not move in ready right now. Its a fact home prices are higher than they have ever been right now. I have some searches for fixer uppers in the 100 to 150k range but have not seen anything there either. Im also looking an areas with decent school districts though. Property taxes in cleveland can also be outrageous depending on where you are.

Maybe you are having better luck than me I don't know. My realtor said hes never seen a market this seller friendly. Even fixer uppers are being sold instantly to flippers.
What it "should be" is much trickier for someone like me to put a number on.  One reason average income families are "willing" to pay more than what the home might actually be worth is because...well that's about the average price in the area.  Say most family income levels dictate that the price most families could afford was $x.  If most of the homes in that area are more than $x, then they're just being forced to pay the highest price.  Judging by average household incomes, and by home prices, the average american family hasn't been able to afford the average household price in a long time.  Luckily, America is absolutely fantastic at creating debt for consumers.
Yeah dude bail. If it isn’t fun now it’ll be miserable with a ring and a kid or two.

Winter is coming. This week forecasts a high chance of avalanche.
I would have picked a different number if that were the case.
When the inevitable wife finds a new boyfriend and goes after half his money, if he’s able to prove that it was made BEFORE their marriage, he should be ok. Though this does come under scrutiny as to what is spent using that money (lawyers find all that shit out). Don’t forget the time of marriage as well. 1 year of alimony for every 3 years of marriage, usually calculated after the first 5 years unless there’s major income gaps. 

If this guy was in this sub:
Pay taxes
Pay off truck
Pay off any of HIS outstanding debt
Buy house in his name (she has no attachment until they’re married with QCD, even still, pre-marital asset in his favor)
Whatever is left in the portfolio should stay in that account and never be touched. If he’s going to play with stocks again, he’d have to set up a new portfolio AFTER being married. The first one couldn’t be gone after since it’s before marriage, second could be split 50/50

Then use margin balance to write puts, if he get assigned, sell more calls, ride that margin like a fucking champ.

He can do this while working another 10 years and retire at 35 with a beautiful fucking house and a hotter wife.

My shares are at +300% percent since march.  I was so tired of figuring what to do that I sold like a third in august to cover the initial purchase and decided to just let the remaining ones (profit) go to the moon or bust.

Now I'm here asking the same fuckin question about them.  Holding seems stupid as fuck.  We all know deep inside this stock will drop 75% at some point but we also know it might be in two frickin years.
Yeah.  NEver give up on yourself or other people. You never know what someone is going trough.

Pfe going up in old news but crm should see some movement 🤞- I hope 🤙🏻
Property values outside of Austin and Dallas are ridiculously low. 

Rents are even worse. 

Terrible yields on Texas property.
So the reason I am bullish on the dollar is debt repayments. A lot of debt is dollar demoninated so the companies will need dollars to pay off the loans.

Normally I would have said that companies will roll it forward, but that is getting harder as banks are getting more and more restrictive in who they want to lend to and how much at what cost. They might still roll some of it forward, but I think it'll be less then 100% of the outstanding debt.

So I believe that at some point companies will have to start repaying loans, and they will need dollars to do so. And then the obvious supply and demand controlls kick in, more demand combined with less supply (remember credit is restricted) should lead to a higher price. 
At least that's my thesis for being dollar bullish.

I’m unsure what you mean by GA runoffs begin 12/14. Vote is 1/5 which you note, but campaigning for it has certainly begun for a while. Not a relevant date.

Electors vote tomorrow, not 1/5. I don’t think anyone with a brain thinks anything other than a Biden presidency is confirmed.

I’m looking to buy into weed options for the GA runoffs but that’s more like a play in a couple weeks and as far as I’m concerned the only important catalyst.

Playing the NJ vote is good but it’s a small state.

Buy long term, just flushed 5k buying 12/11 weeklies on PLTR.
Property taxes in Texas are some of the highest in the country. 

The money earned from charging oil companies through the nose for land holdings is what allows the state to have no income tax. Honestly, if Musk gets the kind of market penetration he wants with EV, it will probably force Texas to provision an income tax as oil and gas will be massively impacted.

Frankly, there will be no changes to how any of these enterprises operate. It's just rich assholes making a show of how they are avoiding taxes. There aren't any meaningful regulations in California which make operating Tesla or HP or Oracle there more difficult. They have been there for decades and grown into behemoths there.

Had a hard time with those because I couldn't leverage as hard and the movements were small. Also the bubble is here. We all just holding our breath. Little 2008 advice.

The only way dollar can get stronger is 1) no stimulus. 2) republican held senate. 3) Janet turns into Paul Volker. Since none of these can happen. I just dont know if dollar can rebound. Europe has negative interest I believe. I am still holding a little position in eurodollar based on libor interest. Not 100% sure how it works but i am with you it's going to 0. A little $18 risk for 150 profit potential. Seems like a good gamble. Pop is reading 98% so I guess it's a given. Riding to march exp.

Yeah, Burry cut about a third of his position after roughly tripling his investment. Seems to me like he just recouped his investment and is now playing with house money.

No. We're eyeing your retarded way of losing money. You fomo fucker. Why not wait for a dip? Haven't you seen that Tesla is stuck in the same price range for quite some time now? We might see a pullback soon. And then rise to 800 by earnings
StONKs OnLY gO Up
But futures in currency is a strange thing. As the option advances in your favor the buy power is reduced to let you continually leverage forward. I can only imagine with portfolio margin the level of instant bankruptcy you could get into. And with std deviation curves, some diligence about the ECB and the fed, it's alot easier to track a direction than say, Tesla. High risk. Maybe. Very short term. Probably taxed into hell. The way I burn money it probably won't matter

Ideas on how to pass the time when market is closed - go
"Small amount"/5-10% is by definition **not** a YOLO lol
This one should probably be its own post - but I look at it this way. Tesla is the Apple of electric cars/energy. Almost everyone has an Apple product. So, almost everyone will have a Tesla. Apples market cap is $2 trillion. Tesla's is currently only $600 billion. An iPhone weighs about a half a pound. A model 3 weighs 3500 pounds.

Simple math tells us 3500 \* 0.5 = 7000. A Tesla weighs 7000 times that of an iPhone, so therefore if we weigh the stocks equally, 7000 \* 600 billion = $4200 Trillion market cap for Tesla.

I've posted a few times about my positions (I mostly trade spreads, butterflies, and condors). NFLX is shaping up to be a perfect condor play. It's been in a wedge pattern and I think should trade between 500 and 540 for the next few days/upcoming week. Strength and resistance is at 490 and 540. Max Pain is at 500. It could turn out to be a good quick profit come Wednesday/Thursday. Here's what I might enter on Monday: SELL -1 IRON CONDOR NFLX 100 18 DEC 20 535/540/495/490 CALL/PUT @2.06 LMT.

Closing down smaller and less profitable stores is a good move. The big question is whether business will shift to their other stores or their online stores. But as I remember in the earnings call the CEO said they see such a shift to other sales channels within Gamestop, which is encouraging.  


TLDR: Ryan Cohen wrote a letter about closing stores. GME is closing stores. Squeeze incoming. Or maybe not. Who knows.

12/14 is the electoral college meeting. Jan 6 is when Congress meets to “count” the electoral votes. 

Would like to add that any member of the house and senate can challenge an electoral vote, forcing the house and senate to debate the issue. To sustain the objection, BOTH the house and senate need to agree in a simple majority to eliminate the electoral vote(s) in question. 

I personally think there is a very strong chance of this happening, but because dems control the house it will go nowhere. It’ll be a publicity stunt. 

What does this mean for the market? Potentially more uncertainty, so stock may go down, may go up, or may go sideways

Thats a lazy strategy, capital should be deployed to companies that deserve growth. Do the work. The economy gets weak when we all start to centralize. A diversified economy where everyone makes independent decisions is the strongest economy possible. 

Deploy money in a positive way, finding small and medium sized companies that deserve capital is the best way to beat the market and it also makes the economy stronger.    


It might be harder, but you will learn more this way and you will gain more in the long run because you will get smarter.

I don’t see the comparison there either. The supply challenge being solved there is a very high return rate due to clothe sizing. My pants are too small! Need to return. These shoes run big!

New games don’t get returned often, they are simply blu rays with a super super small failure rate.

Hardware never gets returned due to failure as they have manufacture warranties. Ps5s are returned to Sony.

It wouldn’t be a problem that needs to be solved on a games end.

I frequently fill out requests for spending corporate funds so I’m mostly just thinking what I’d have to argue if I was the requestor here.

These companies don’t really make money off vaccines anyway. It’s not a part of the business that is profitable in the normal sense, so most of the increase in stock price has been about hype and visibility, not actual potential profits on a vaccine.

Dave's point is this:

This guy is in a position right now at 25 to own a vehicle and a house with no debt. That makes him richer than virtually every normal 25yo. 
Sure this guy could YOLO his money and be a multi-millionaire a week from now but he could also end up with nothing. If this guy does what Dave says it opens up well over $1k/month that this guy could then invest while owning outright a home. If this guy follows Dave's advice he will be a multi-millionaire, it will just take longer but be far more likely.
It’s gonna take either war on or near US soil, another but NEW pandemic, death to POTUS, alien invasion, or California falling into the ocean to replicate that drop. However we will see a 1,500-2,500 pt pullback starting later this week if the US stimulus isn’t passed or about to be passed.

Why would they? Their supply chain system is already pretty efficient and physical games make almost no money for the retailer. Profit on a new game was like 8 dollars at 60 dollars and negative on sale games about 5 years ago when I had access to wholesales. It works with Whole Foods as expiring fresh items like produce are naturally tougher to supply chain.

Amazon could get way more bang for their buck investing just about anywhere else.

I’m not saying another company wouldn’t do it, I’m just trying to say Amazon has no reason too.

Keep track of what's outpacing what in terms of gains. Learn, guess the future and adjust for that future after observation for a good long while.

Why not both? Future of retail is blended. Meaning people will look online and then go to the store. Human connection is still important. A customer might have a preference between online and offline purchases, but when it comes to how they buy, “very few people exclusively shop online or only in store. They marry the best of both worlds,” said Ber

Amazon has understood that what shoppers love most is choice. The retailer sees that the future of the industry won’t be black or white in choosing only online or only in-store, it will be multichannel.

At its very core, a shop is a giant display room for your products. One of Amazon’s reasons for entering into physical stores is that it allows the retailer to show off its wares and entice customers to buy even more into its ecosystem.

This is why we see Amazon products in Whole Foods. 

Stores help Amazon offset rising shipping costs

They are a shipping giant. Amazon’s shipping costs from 2015 to 2017 almost doubled to $22 billion.

By accessing store space, it means Amazon can reduce shipping costs and improve the returns process for customers.

The stores can act as pick-up points for customers, so Amazon lowers its delivery costs. Even better, it draws customers into store so while they’re picking up their order, where they might be tempted to shop even more.

Customers want to be able to return their orders easily. A trip to the post office might not always be convenient, so dropping by a store offers them another option.

So maybe it will become a bubble later. But it's not now. What happens when passive index people retire? They start to withdraw, slowly steadily, and regardless of pricing. Hmmm, blind steady selling sounds like a counter-balance to blind steady buying. Maybe the pending bubble won't be as crazy as burry thinks.

So many flaws in this analysis. Not sure if you actually understand what the sp500 actually is, because if you did, you wouldn’t tout numbers like 100m shares and would actually pray for something on the line of 60m or 50m shares but logically 70m - 80m shares is more probabilistic.

I said "good luck with that" good brexit news.

Also, not bullish =/= bearish. I do not believe the vaccine rubber stamp is bullish or bearish. It's simply priced in.

I agree. India had great potential in 2013 but I heard it didn’t do so well after that due to its own monetary policies.
I don't understand this vaccine distribution. Military says they aren't touching one dose of this, but somehow they are tracking and moving it? UPS / FedEx doing all the work, private companies doing all the work & own it. Yet somehow I'm told DOD , HHS, CDC, FDA, NIH, and BARDA are all working together to do this? WTF. Since when can the government do anything right? They are only sending half out now, and saving the other half for next month, and most of it is going to health care workers who most of them say they won't take it. RIP old people. You don't get any.

From my recollection, as well as a 6 minute video of him doing so, mango disavowed white supremacists on a multitude of occasions. In addition, what policies exactly did he enact that would garner the support of such people? Or could it be possible that they liked his personality and his boisterous nature.

The makeup of the republican party doesn't bug me. In addition the areas his team contested are large democrat cities which are primarily centers of african american residents. Correlation =/ causation
That would be amazing but I expect it to finally hit the $30s.
He should've just bought options on Kodak or Tesla
I still look up reaction videos from time to time.  Always amusing.
Not at all. I think people are way too bearish. The numbers don’t add up to me, and I think it will get real in March when they report Q4 numbers and pay another massive chunk of debt off. They will be profitable again with a massive cash pile from Q4 that they will add to the current massive cash pile. Depending on how things go with Cohen, they will either buy back more stock, pay down the long term debt, offer a dividend, or invest in capEx. 

The 2nd point I wanted to know how it effects their future. They get a cut of every digital purchase made on each Xbox they sell. The xboxes have been sold out. If digital is going to be the future, for a $1B market cap company that revenue isn’t trivial and will make a difference. I just can’t see this company being much cheaper before value hunters come after it.

Edit* one thing people aren't really considering is, even at the current price gamestop could just take the company private with the cash they have on hand. After Q4 they would have an even larger cushion for doing so. The only issue with that is Cohen, he owns 10% and would be hard to shake lose. Also an announcement like that is sure to cause a squeeze which would make the price too expensive to buy back. Either way a company that has almost the same amount of cash as it's market cap is a no brainier investment for me personally.

No they haven't. They haven't released any data at all, unlike QS. 10 minute charging and 500km range are their stated targets they are also the easy bit, toyota reportedly have significant issues with cell longevity, i.e. dendrite formation which has always been the stumbling block for solid state until QS demonstrated they had solved it.

 I'm sure they will get there, and I'm sure there'll be a concept car with a solid state battery in it revealed next year, but they started 5 years later and QS have an actual working solid state battery which ticks all of the 'and' requirements, and can start to be designed into actual cars which will actually be sold from 2025.

The beauty of GME is that they have e-commerce and stores. When Cohen gets control he has 600M in cash, a lot of existing stores, an already great brand and a working e-commerce site.  He will sell a lot of stores but I think keeping some is definetly the move. There are some profitable ones that could also be used for marketing. Cohen didnt have these things when building chewy and he knows this.

In general, states with lax regulations and little taxes will see their REITs soar especially residential. COVID really forced companies to experiment with things they wouldn't prior. One of it is to enable workers to work from home and productivity has soared. Workers will move to lower tax and lower cost areas to work from home.

You can be sure, that these PIPE investors wouldn’t sell all their shares at once. 
First because they would destroy a lot of their profit as the price would go south so much most of their gains would be gone long before the last share is sold and second because this would manipulate the market so much, it is simply not allowed.

Additionally, why would Fidelity and Janus want to gain liquidity in such dimensions. Their investors wouldn’t profit at all especially since QS seems to be a very solid long term play and there is a lot of uncertainty in the markets right now.
Volkswagen has for sure zero interest in selling shares, their investment in QS is due to an operative interest not an investment interest. Volkswagen partnered with QS and relies on their battery technology.  

If your speculation about the possible start date for the sales is correct the only thing that might happen is a fractional sell off to lock in some profits, which will cause a even higher buying pressure from investors who are waiting to get in.

Legit the European startup/tech scene is fucking sad. I worked in the European startup industry for a long time. They like to pretend they are like America and have this whole startup scene with meetups and conventions and shit, but their biggest success stories are like Spotify and a few food delivery apps.

I don't really know what the fuck it is, because obviously there are a lot of smart people in Europe. But the US has new tech companies exploding like every fucking day, and Europe just can't do it.
Or...mRNA
sure. my point is the eu is actually fucking garbage and it’s crazy that third world countries can veto a country like germany

Isn’t the reason the stimulus isn’t passing is because of a 500 billion dollar relief for small businesses? I’m pretty pelosi is opposed to that
Lambos.
I look for spreads that have at least a 1:1 risk/reward. For example, the DE iron condor was a max profit of like 250 and risk was 200 and the TSLA spreads were like 200 profit and 150 risk I believe. My ultimate goal is to let them expire worthless but my more realistic and profitable approach is to buy back to close when I reach 50-75% profit.

The amount changes each week, last week I was a bit over leveraged with the Amazon, TSLA, and NVDA spreads all at once. My general rule of thumb for these is: be fine risking the entire credit received if it goes sour. That way I get in a mindset of not entering spreads that have a high potential profit but bad setups.

Here’s something a little more concrete. I want a 1:1 risk:reward at a minimum. With that, I also don’t risk more than $200 per spread and more than 500 per trade total. I’ll leverage up to 2-3.5g (about 15-20% of my main trading account) across different industries, exchanges, etc. if one goes south it doesn’t mean the others will. Using my rule of never risk more than you’re willing to lose in total takes the emotion out of a losing trade. It sucks to lose that 500 bucks but it’s a small position that won’t blow up my account. And I’ll make it up elsewhere.
Much agree - just discovered options trading on my mostly dormant portfolio.  Was just buy and hold guy forever.  Made about 10k in premiums this last two weeks alone mostly selling puts.  Gonna keep it going for 2021 and see if it’s time to retire from the daily grind and just do the wheel.  Wouldn’t have tried it if we hadn’t amassed such a huge cash pile these last few years

Well yeah, I like WSB because it is not as risk averse as other places and I really hate the risk adversity of other places. But most of the time, and I think we're as well, I'm on a completely different time horizon than WSB. 

I'm solely buying the long term bond ETFs (I really don't want to actively manage this trade, just set and forget it) because I think interest rates will drop to 0 in the next year or two and the dollar will appreciate.

Ok some extra DD for ya.

Went to one of the hundreds of GME stores that are closing.  Had to get a game for the Wii.

I talked to the 359 lbs guy working there.  He said that they can’t keep anything in stock.  Even old shit is flying off the shelves.  People are even buying stupid Modern Warfare clothing.

Then he said he was going to get some KFC across the street.  I thought that meant he would lock up .

NOPE.  He said he doesn’t give a shit if people steal.  So he left the store open with no one in it for at least 30 minutes. 

Also someone had bought/stole the game I was looking for that morning.

There’s a difference between index funds (that have to buy on the 21st) and funds and things that benchmark to the index (which can buy whenever but as gauges on how closely their return matches the index)

There’s also always a settlement period after hours every day for the mms to balance their order books. That is when the big purchases/sales of Tesla will be made my the funds. So I expect a gap up or gap down after close on the 21st
thats the real question

It's just options without weeklies and higher leverage. Look out for settlements since some of this mess is delivered goods. And watch out day of expiration you will about lose your mind with the volatility. If you have diamond hands you can really make some money. The only thing I saw would go places that makes no sense is oil and maybe soybeans. Gold was consistent as well as cash because how bad can it go down we got 4 years of 1920s germany style spending coming to Whitehouse. It's obvious. The bubble is gonna pop sooner than later, and then a man in gold could probably make out really well. I guess, you can be long gold and make 100% monthly with right spreads. It works against you sometimes. The damn comision is high on gold $20 with fees for /gcz0. (On Jan futures symbol changes that's the one for December). You have a brain, think about the direction this stuff can go and make that assumption.

ETFs which track the S&P index can only buy TSLA on the day of inclusion or the day prior. If they are allowed to purchase TSLA shares way prior, they wouldn’t be called index funds anymore, would they? Now the downside is that active funds and institutional investors might be offloading their shares to these index funds which might largely create a net-net zero sum game in the end.

Funny thing is, they actually could have helped, and we‘re seeing it rn. 

Greece is using them for contact tracing, health companies are using them for improved testing procedures on medicaments, uk is using them to deliver the vaccine. 

I‘m in Germany where a big story rn is that our public health offices have given up on contact tracing due to the amount of work involved. I experienced that with friends and relatives who were close to COVID positive ppl and are basically waiting for info for weeks. 

All I can think about is basically „man, if only there were a software we could have deployed during summer that would allow us to make sense out of huge amounts of data and maybe predict hotspots before they happen“

I made some money but it wasn't consistent. I basically made it in euros to piss it away on otm calls.

You're probably correct short term, but just as a counter thesis, QS is an amazing super long play: 

Buy the subsequent dip or hold if you got shares early on QS.

They absolutely have the best next gen battery technology and the first thing to be a significant step better over Li ion in terms of energy density and charging time for the same longevity and cost with their solid state Li. They're years ahead of Panasonic's solid state efforts and Tesla haven't even started developing solid state yet. QS batteries are probably going to be in a significant proportion of EVs in 5-10 years imo giving them a huge potential market and an opportunity to be a several orders of magnitude bagger.

100kwh battery at $100 per kWh = $10k per battery, 100 million vehicles produced a year = $1T pa revenue total market size. Most countries moving towards ev only vehicles from 2030 onwards. Even having a moderate slice of that pie in 10 yrs would make anyone who bought 100 shares at $10 a millionaire imo.
Fuck no

Gold is a safety play. Stonks go down, gold goes up.

Gold miners are a gamble. Gold goes up, miners go up, sometimes by many times more than gold itself. But if gold goes down, miners go down, sometimes to zero.

If stonks go up - and stonks only go up - gold is still gold but miners (heh, butt miners) may be fucked.

You say yourself gold miners have better returns. We know risk and return are related. So gold miners have higher risk.

Sorry bro. That sucks. Saw that pump the night before too. Did it drop before open?

To begin both R overpreformed donny dump by about 2 points. Ga is historically a red state and dems tend not to win runoffs-- see 2009 runoff. Less turnout and the lack of a demoaguage at the top means normal voting patterns.

I played bntx calls and got massively fucked over and that is when i realized this shit was priced in 3 weeks ago
sounds like calls to me
Any experience and wise trader here can explain to me on what to expect of tsla going into next week? Do funds still need to buy more tsla for the inclusion? I’m assuming they already have accumulated all they need even before the announcement. Saw a post 2 months ago showing that that while retail buying was slowing down. Funds were increasing their position heavily.

Don't be stupid. It's the most telegraphed trade in the world. Every hedge fund and speculators retail and wholesale have been buying TSLA to dump to index funds next week. At best it's a wash and a nothing burger. At worst it will tank huge because of how crowded the trade is. 

Tldr: TSLA 12/31 P500
instructions unclear: started paper route.
If market opens red, DIS goes down.

If market opens green, DIS already has it priced in.

Either way I win; anyone else doing riskless arbitrage here?

People are always losing their net worth in the stock market. Always. Always.

Doing this with the likes of game and nikola you may as well just buy the shares. The itm options don't work out much cheaper I believe.     
Plus if you have a margin account you can usually buy at 1/2 up to 1/8 the price.

So it's the black Santa that has a knife? That is so racist.
This "plug-in" you speak of is custom software. You can have a standardized ingestion point, usually an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), but this ingestion point requires data in a certain format. The problem is that you will never know how the format that the client data is stored in ahead of time. This means that at some point you have to write a program, or a script, or a data pipeline (whatever you want to call it) to move things between the client database and the ingestion point and at this point you're basically doing data engineering consulting.
If you have a system more power to you
Yeah tech had a good run. So saying shit like "the market has been the easiest it's ever been" when people are losing their net worth is fucking annoying.

>The bigger risk tho would be if the price dropped enough, that the short call premium doesn’t cover the loss in value of the long contract. 
Tbh this is the same risk as with covered calls. Stock can drop in value more than the cc makes.. So I don't see why doing the poor man's covered call would fare any worse.    
I believe the big issue is what you first highlighted. The stock mooning and him having to close the weekly covered call at a loss.

Bruh, why are you being so pedantic. Saying "spy is up 16% on the year, " while completely ignoring that it was down 30% at one point, is just willful ignorance.

Shit went from -30% to +16% in like 8 months. If that's not a bull run to you, then you're just being a contrarian for no reason. 

And that's not even mentioning QQQ, that went from -20% to +50%.

And all the stocks like Tesla that just went to the fucking moon.

Also, 16% is a huge year for an index, anyway.

i'm not gonna write it 'cause it would be too long and I figured out that if you're trading  just as I do, the only thing that matters is that the text appears to be big enough so it's a serious post.

In 2080, man will have made Mars fully inhabitable and self sufficient. Earth will be dying and depleted of resources. The people of Earth will try to take resources from Mars. Elon tried to save Earth but he could not do anything impactful due to all the greedy shitheads out there; his successors did not have the visionary mindset of his and we’re only driven by profit. They decided to exploit the profits of war. LThe SpaceX Federation that inhabits Mars will have been in a 30 year war with the United Nations. 
 
The people that moved to Mars were the ones who believed in Elon. Autist and retards alike they lucked out on the chance that all of Tesla’s technology created a thriving ecosystem in Mars. Only those who were rich enough by holding calls on TSLA were able to move to this new lush landscape called Mars. 

Who do you think will providing all the materials and technology needed for this galactic war? None other than Tesla.

> It's about developing heard immunity

Isolate the elderly and vulnerable, reopen society and herd immunity within months
Experts don't yet know how long the vaccines are effective for. They've only been able to observe, through trials, effective periods of 2-3 months. The success rates over those periods has been in the 90s range. 

It could very well then be that the vaccine becomes in effective after 4 or 5 or 6 months for example.

In thst case by the time we get to April or May, the folks who get the vaccine this month will need to be vaccinated again. And to reach herd immunity becomes a lot harder.

It could easily roll on to late next year or 2022 if the vaccines currently developed do not remain effective for long periods of time.

Well, that's sort of misleading. Some young people have died, but more importantly, many young people are having lasting effects, like troubled breathing, loss of smell, etc etc.

But, vaccines aren't really just about protecting yourself. It's about developing heard immunity. So low-risk people still need to get it to wipe out the virus, protecting high-risk people.

Market is sending a pretty clear signal on this imo. Clearly did not like the slack buy, and even though that may just be a short term story as far as the stock goes, the fact that the stock just keeps drifting lower while consensus remains extremely bullish is a very bad R/R to be long here imo.

It’s not just CRM. All of mega cap tech looks to quietly be entering at least a short term bear market. I would be staying far away from all of these stocks.
Pretty good description from what I’ve played so far. Better than rage though by far.

If the trend is tilting you then try iron condors then (do a put credit spread under stock price and a call credit spread above stock price). With the more $ you collect from having an extra spread you can choose option prices a little farther away from the current stock $. and the awesome thing is, if you enter and exit both spreads at same time, you just need the collateral of one of the spreads to do it. 

If you are scared of one side more than the other, move that spread father away from the stock $. Just queue up the premium you'd be okay with (like >40% of the spread), check "good for 90 days" so you don't have to set it up every day and IGNORE it lol. 

I don't even check my RH during work and once a day at lunch when I check it, it's like oh nice new credit spread or condor got filled and when that shit expires worth $0 on Friday you relax with the free $2-3k that you made by doing nothing.

But, people really ride CDPR's dick way too hard. It's not like they are some godly developer that can only make the world's best games. As soon as I saw they were trying to make a first-person scifi game, on a whole new engine, I figured there was a good chance it would suck.

They really should've just made a non-witcher game on the Witcher 3 engine.  People fucking like it, why mess with it?

I dunno, I feel like Monday could be red. The amount of people who went in on Friday afternoon must be insane. 4 red days, and we started to recover in the afternoon. That was people thinking "4 red days Jesus christ, next week has to be green." A lot of dumb money was trapped.

I would create an argument of there's just as much risk with a bank account. John Bogle argued as much. After everything you're looking at about -1-2% a year return sitting in a bank account due to inflation. If you can't create an argument do to your inexperience then you should probably cave.

Isn’t it just another shooter?
*Whom* am I kidding
It's actually kinda crazy how many new traders started in March-September, literally just buying calls and printing during this retard-strength bull run after a crash.

They have such a warped view of how the market works, and how easy it is to make money. If these people were smart, they'd cash out and never trade again. Live happily with their free nest egg. But they won't, and they'll end up losing it all within a year.

I'm not predicting a crash, I'm just saying that the market has never been as easy as it was in the past 8 months. You could literally just buy tech calls and be good, with very few exceptions. 

There either will be a second big drop like many are predicting, or the market will go back to normal mode. Either way, these people who just buy calls are going to start getting rekt sooner rather than later.
Need some orbital descent to happen but then lots of retard will die trying to ride the dragon that day.

I didn't do the math either but the $1000 figure was definitely too high at first glance. I'd say it also depends on how much savings he's talking about. If he had $50k, he only has to make around 1% a month to cover the rent payment even after tax (probably 10% for earnings that low). If he only had like 5k then yeah that's pretty dumb because he has to make 10% a month to keep up.

Even with a dem controlled congress, I doubt anything changes (especially with the bill that was just voted on in the house, it would never have a chance of passing in its current form) as not all dems are pro-changing marijuana laws (lots of people who have voted against it in the past still prepared to die on that hill). If anything did change though, it would be likely for federal decriminalization and reschedule with the states/counties deciding whether to sell it legally or not rather than a full-on legalization.

Bruh why are you being such a pedant. I didn't do the exact math on some random person's breakeven because it's fucking 4am on the WSB discussion thread.

You understand my point. Dude took on a rent payment just to be allowed to trade, which means he basically starts every month $400 red, automatically. It's silly.
If anything, they're just thinking you're too stupid and will lose it all so they are starting a savings account for you.

Ok...Iron Condors when used well are pretty good.  For example right before NVDA earnings I sold an Iron condor.  I had 5 point wings so $500 max loss.  I received $475 for selling the condor - so $25 at risk.  I bought back the condor after earnings for $175 for a gain of $300.  You need to know the stock and know where to set the limits.  Then you let theta bleed and IV crush and the money is yours.  The key to a condor is to put it into play early with a large credit and then buy it back as soon as the event has occurred and you can take a profit.  Keep the wings small.
This. I hate how much tired resolutions are a thing just because of the date.

Hi George
Except when their annual reports are audited by Price Waterhouse Coopers. A big 4 accounting firm based in London conforming to US GAAP. DYOR and save yourself looking like a clown.  


Your not wrong to question their offering compared to sales, but then again Tesla has done the exact same thing in the past, and it makes sense given the high stock valuation to garner more investment rather than taking on debt.
Risking how much?
You could know *everything* about the underlying, and then the fed cuts rates or some shit and the whole market moves and you're OTM.

That's why I said "close to." depends on tax bracket, but he's probably technically break even around $750 gains.

But it's pretty hard to make stable gains to pay rent in the stock market, unless you're rich and theta gang. But if that were the case, he'd probably have his own place.

He basically yolo'd and got lucky, but added a monthly rent expense to do so.
Stockdweebs, a team of analysts that is almost always right, just sent a warning that a larger than expected drop is in the near future.

He never sent a twitter "fleet" or whatever warning like this even during march.

Im shook.

Received or Paid?  I think you are paying $1000 no matter what the outcome. If you received $1350 then you are ahead by $350.
If you gave up $1350, your total loss will be $2350. Yikes.
At least you will get a good tax write off ~ $517 if in 22% bracket.

Probably for the best bro I’m in the same boat except with sports betting
Look at the math u have 1000$  in this etf, u lose 10% so 3x this and u get 700, now u gain 30% and are at 910$. Over the long run these net the same as the normal 1x etf.... of 10%.  BUT IF YOU can sell before they drop and buy when they drop you'll be rich but as we cannot using a moving average over the last 12 months can ve very useful for leveraged ETFS. From. Back testing index funds and the total stock market  using a moving average netted roughly 15% gains but that may have been just luck. Also the increased volatility can just absolutely destroy you. I wouldn't risk more than 10% and thats only if I feel dubious
That'll be 500k for 20%. 🚀🚀🚀

I vaguely remember VC exploding right after the 2009 bust as money was looking for any positive returns. I think we're gonna start seeing a lot of that soon especially with some lockdown 'inventions' and other related innovations. A couple are gonna hit and every Larry with a contraption/API will get $750k startup funding. The Juicero(a housing bust VC child) will look quaint in no time. 

There's probably good discussion to be had on how that 2009-11 VC hunting led to critical early support for then-risky ventures like Uber, Twitter, Instagram, and other now household companies. But I'm tired and rambling now. 

Tl:dr; next few years are going to be the best time to start a techy company possibly ever.

Hey now, just because the boomer GME board members plundered my butthole because they wanna keep their jobs instead of taking GME to the moon,  that doesn't mean my butt isn't virgin anymore..right?
Yes that’s the plan. The fed wants more QE and everyone is arguing on the size of the stimulus not if we need more stimulus. History and economics has shown from 2008 that stimulus helps the economy. The money eventually heads back to the fed. Just take a second to think about how money flows through the economy.

No doubt we are in a bubble. Interest rates will remain zero until 2022. If you look throughout history, the dotcom bubble ran for a while. I’d say if you are betting on markets plunging >30-40%, you might run out of money before it truly happens. And yes i do believe in a correction. Who knows where money will flow and which stocks will have the correct valuations at that point, BUT ride the wave. We are in a clear bull market with potential pullbacks depending on the day to day catalysts. If you think about it, the Fed has put the market on training wheels. Nothing gives me reason to believe we see a major reversal into bear territory for the next 1-2 years. Especially with the Dems winning potential senate PLUS janet yellen’s nomination.
Oh okay. Yeah, waiting for a deeper pull back to buy as well but will likely buy something like RIOT or the OTC version most likely. Trading on those coin exchanges are a hassle to me.

If we brred at maximum force before COVID, market would have sold off because it hints at weakness (why are we printing so much? Something must be wrong). However, we brred at maximum force after COVID and markets are rallying because it shows strength (Fed got a plan, JPow won’t let us down, we got this boys)

I agree buying in cash is very difficult for most and I think for most it’s better to have a 30 year fixed mortgage over 15 year fixed even though it may cost more over the long term the equity in the home after this mortgage term pays off itself as the value of the house will increase much more than having a 15 year fixed

This was my line of thinking until QS shot up in recent weeks.  The SPAC was already trading before I even knew anything about the company. I heard about the company, researched, and thought *oh fuck yeah, I'll get this at IPO*

Then I saw KCAC existed, and already mooned, so everything was priced in. Apparently not.
So what I'm sorta understanding from all this is that once we return to normal equities will almost certainly return to fair value, correct? 

If whatever the fed is doing now is only allowed during dire times, they will almost certainly go back to more conservative measures once we get past covid, which will mean the factors leading to this market pump will decrease, in turn bringing markets down?

In the mood for copypasta, haven’t seen a good one lately. What y’all got?
Stocks accelerated mainly bc of quantitative easing on steroids where fed printed unlimited money with their lending programs and zero interest rates. Why would we ever find ourselves in that position pre covid??? They are letting inflation rate run to a bit over 2%. 

To answer your question, this market rally only happened bc all the stars aligned with covid -> economic downturn -> fed supporting market any way they can. The downside to this and why fed doesnt do any other time, huge K-shaped market, interest rates are normally not zero (how are they going to stimulate the actual economy?? Not this detached delusion of a market.), congress wouldn’t approve this much spending unless needed for dire consequences bc it does add to national debt and weaken the dollar (downside to fiat currency model)
Well QE has shot up since the pandemic, which in turn is causing this huge gain in the stock markets. Why can't we just keep it at this level or brrrr even more? If there are no negative consequences, we should keep the markets increasing like this, right?
Dude you nailed it. Meant to hit you up on Friday but my screen was covered in tears.
If you want the real truth, Palantir is simply doing for our public and private sector, what China's government already does but our government can't, due to that pesky Constitution of ours. What Palantir does is soo fuckin vital to our national security that I can't even begin to try and explain it without writing a dissertation. Then the upside of our private sector having free reign is also vital to us preserving our role as the world's economic hegemon. The growth that they can expect under their current leadership and the hidden institutional demand will not simply take them to the triple and quadruple digits by the end of 2030, but beyond to the point where they will essentially become a defacto branch of our national intelligence apparatus. This shit is retirement stock. Literally the only time to buy actual shares. Every options play I make with them is to get as much money as I can, to buy up as many shares as I can afford. My grandkids will be living off this shit if I do it right.

Rich people aren't spending more but with the increased money supply,  they're throwing it into real estate and stocks. The dollar is getting absolutely destroyed, DXY could easily be in the 80s next year. Losing 10% of its value against other currencies in just one year is insane. 

It's not truly hyperinflation just yet but we're on the trajectory.

If you adjust SPY for the dollar devaluation it doesn't look quite as overvalued

Covid. You living under a rock? 

On the real, no shit this is creating the largest wealth gap in history but that was the way the stock market was designed. Fed printing money is fine at this point in time bc they have taken stop gaps to prevent serious contraction by removing interest rates until 2022. We will see pull backs every now and then but no serious drops (20-30% drops). If i were you i’d hop into lazr puts. That’s the only thing that will go down. Don’t fight broader market. It will behave more irrationally than your liquidity and time

Really unfair to be honest now the thing is going to be so fucking expensive cause we will have their next Q financials being actual money printers.

if it "popped" on monday, I'd have over 7 figures, probably. Depends on how bad it gets. I'm 125k deep in uvxy 15c 1/21 so if we get a March type crash it'll be a lot more but I wouldn't hold it that long anyways

That 15% gain in the S&P isn't solely due to the Fed. You realize there are other factors, like that no one is spending their money right now, right?

The Fed has been printing money for a long time man. It didn't just start now because of covid.

No clue. That’s why I asked.
Here's a thought exercise for you bulls!

If money printing and whatever else the fed is doing now is good, why weren't we doing it before Covid? Why weren't we seeing these kinds of gains (15% in 1 month) last year? Or the year before that? I assume if we could have gotten these kinds of gains before, wouldn't we have done it? Trump was basing a lot of his legacy on market gains.

Pretty much. The stock's a rock. Barely budges in either direction.
No argument from me on your points. But there are also different risks associated with the current environment. 

There’s political risk - how is this monetary policy perceived by the populous, and what could happen if sentiment became more toxic?

There’s raw economic productivity - things like employment levels and discretionary spending. 

There’s non-zero disease risk still. 

I guess what I’m saying is there are scenarios where the printer goes offline.

no real standouts besides the pop smoke one. The production was lit but its not a bop/hit for me. just a sliight vibe not a full vibe

loved passion album alot of stand outs on there
Those both sound pretty bad

What are the actual chances that we're in a dead cat bounce since surpassing ATH in june? 

I think reverting to spy 310-330 is a lot more likely than going up to 400+

Speaking for myself here, i was confident that earnings would miss but there was a voice in my head saying "what if the MOASS happens and you miss it because you were trying to be clever?". So i mentally prepared myself for the loss and held through because if i missed the squeeze I'd have been even more disappointed.
Yes it is hard to say  whether the disc dies with this console generation. I suspect it could happen but sony and xbox both produced a disc version so that speaks volumes. I myself have an xbox one and rely on digital games. Hmm.... Still love that GME sells the consoles though. Cant download one of those.
This gives me PTSD. I was here for the last quad witching. I lost half my portfolio. Ive recovered since then but im not touching this with a 10 foot pole. Good luck to all you autists who participate....
Really? What fucking insight. It's akin to, "People eventually die."
Me and some guys here actually had a considerable amount of puts (FXI + YUMC puts along with YANG calls) ready anticipating the huge drop due to knowing that coronavirus was much bigger than the fucking retards that were saying it's just a flu were saying. Unfortunately the WHO conferance fucked a bunch of us over because China paid off a bunch of the officials there to say that it's under control and that China is doing a good job containing it.   


THEN people finally started to realize how bad it was and dropped a few months later.
Yup devs get paid more and is an easier entry point into the area. Highly recommend, easy to get promoted to better positions too because you frequently interact with higher ups
unless you believe we're in a better spot  than we were before covid, volatility is free money imo

And it seems like you don't know what a bubble really looks like. 1995 was a bubble. Then the market boomed more than ever for another five years. 

How do you really think you can defy the statistics? 

More than that, what are you going to do about it? Are you in cash right now? Because that's FAR dumber.
My insecurities and my main character complex are both ruining my life in different situations
I would definitely buy TSLA $950 Mar 22' calls. I didn't even know that was a thing. I'm gonna pick some up probably. Actually maybe not, idk if IV will kill it, but TSLA will easily break $1000 by then. Probably 2000 and beyond. You heard it here first.

Yeah bro it’s the right thing to do
Gamestop is closing 700 subsidiaries though
We haven't hit hyperinflation yet though. Prices of most commodities are steady. Only thing that has gone up bigly is our balance sheets
We were in a bubble in 1995 too. Have you not realized this, or are you like 12?

And did you just seriously say that we've had the best market year ever? I think you might actually be 8. Or just the most retarded person in retardville.
Sales for disc versions are healthy. Disc isnt dead - yet.
How do you account for the fact that companies are able to stay in the S & P 500 for less and less time as society advances?

20 years ago companies would stay in the sp500 for 40 years on average. Now that’s at 17 years, price action reflects this to some extent for sure. As society changes the market will as well.

It’s going to require tons of inflation for valuations to make sense. But tons of inflation could happen. 

Seems to me like taking a small but far OTM position on an inflationary basket and moving the rest of the portfolio to cash would be safer than total exposure to the market and hoping for inflation. 

These are strange times.

Why are we fucked? The truth is, we're not. It's a sad fact but the economy isn't what it was in 2008. The market doesn't need the plebs anymore. This is why the middle class is going away. You're either in or you're out. It's fucked but it's the truth. 

Facebook still hasn't even come close to fully monetizing. Amazon Walmart and Target are unstoppable because it's cheaper than the alternatives. And the government is collaborating with all this shit. 

The only thing that will pull back the market is psychology, and that can happen at any time. It's literally impossible to try to predict.
Also prepare for nazis in 19 years.

It has not been pretty. Been "buying the dip" everyday for a week. Red is the new green.
When I was like 8 my friend's aunt saw me taking a shit when I left the door open. I was wiping and she lost her shit, metaphorically speaking, and was like "That's the biggest wad of toilet paper I've ever seen! You don't need that much!". 

It was that day that someone taught me to actually wipe my ass properly. I've been using 2-3 squares tops per wipe ever since. 1 square wipe is god tier and hope to master one day.

It's like you've read my mind. I literally moved back home and started stuffing every penny I make into the market because I think we're only seeing the beginning. The government is giving the market a free pass right now. People think the market is high now? During the dotcom bubble \*businesses weren't even making money.\* I don't give a shit what the 'Buffett indicator' says. This thing could go three times higher at least before we plummet again.

 “This is the most over-stretched market in history. If you believe, as I do, that mean reversion (regression to trend) is a natural law of the market - as gravity is to physics - this chart should concern you. (It also comes from Jill Mislinski).  

The S&P 500 is now trading 136% above its long-term trend. That's higher than it was at the height of the 2000 Tech Bubble and higher than the 1929 peak when cabbies and shoe-shine boys were giving stock tips to their customers.”  This is going to get real ugly.

y'all can say technicals don't matter anymore, but you'd be saying covid destroyed basic rules our markets abided by.

Yeah we are very socially progressive but it hampers growth (we value the idea of being "fair" which hurts economically i think). For example, we have this thing called Accident Compensation Corporation which is a gov run entity covering all personal injury claims. You get hit by a car? You're covered and also barred from suing the other party for loss (unless for exemplary damages). This is a good example of social progress and we often wince at the cluttered usa courts full of personal injury claims. 

Your markets are so much funner tho and i go out of my way to pay currency exchange fees to trade on platforms with access to US markets. Honestly, NZ's market is stymmied by a lack of visionaries. The most recent ipos are all property based companies or bullshit credit firms. It's all property here. Quite dull trading on NZX (new Zealand stock exchange). Can't think of a sexy stock since Xero and i was too young and poor to invest in it (xero since left for the australian stock exchange anyway).

So yes, we are socially progressive. But usa is econocially progressive realtive to NZ e.g. Open to the idea of a weed market.

Lol that’s interesting. I would’ve figured they trade a lot individually since they know how to do it.
 The [National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index](https://www.naaim.org/programs/naaim-exposure-index/) hit 107% two weeks ago, the second-highest reading since the survey began in 2006. The highest level of 109% was hit in December 2017, which was followed by a quick 12% correction in January 2018
Literally priced in
could be. i just started tugging on the Radar thread because i've been going down the financial crime rabbit hole lately. Ackman's been chest deep in the Wall Street toilet since the Collisons were children, he'd be the perfect asset for them to help navigate that space

i have some more thoughts to flesh out about why Stripe abandoned their cЯypto projects a few years back but i need to do some more digging first. short version is that cЯypto comes across to me as a hedge against total economic societal meltdown and Stripe and the Collisons are trying to build the vanguard against that scenario.

Not quite sure I understand what you’re saying. I believe nursing homers are 2nd in line to get the vax tho
Yeah, it's pissing me off, cause news today like in Florida said most the vaccine is going to workers at the hospital. Meanwhile, they have enough vaccine there they could just give to most the nursing home residence where 40% of the death comes from. So they could stop 40% of these ICU patients from coming in, but instead they hold most of it for hospital staff. So the dead keep rolling in, but some staff with PPE are getting it where they are saying half of the workers don't want to even take it.

This man actually made a genius trade.

Pretending this vaccine rollout has anything to do with science is a joke. They already said 40% of the deaths are from the 2% in the nursing homes. They could have vaccinated them months ago and moved on. There's no scientific risk reward that hundreds of thousand of dead isn't worth taking the vaccine for this tiny population size with massive risk.

Okay so you're assuming Wiggins is gonna suddenly become a good catch and shoot threat. Until I see that I'm gonna assume he's still a below average shooter. Derozan lite. Oubre is an average shooter and average defender. Draymond is regressing every year. Wiseman is a rookie who is projected to be below average on the defensive end. They don't have any bench. 

Compare w/ the Blazers:

Steph ~ Dame (comparable)
CJ > Wiggins
Roco > Oubre
DJJ > Draymond
Nurkic > Wiseman (unless he comes in and shocks everyone)

GT Jr, Hood, Melo on Portland's bench better than anyone on GSW's bench.

What if I told you that fearing any of this, or fearing the lack of any of this, is all part of the whole thing. You're afraid this is the only life you'll ever get to experience? Okay.. go ahead and spend your whole life afraid of something (or nothing) that may (or may not) ever happen (or not happen). Once you get to review a lifetime wasted, maybe you'll decide to do it differently next time. Or you could snap out of it now and take control. If there is nothing after this, then fuck it, it won't matter anyway. If there is, then hopefully I'll have spent my time here enjoying my life and learning the lessons I'm supposed to be learning. 

My point is, I believe that no matter what happens after I die on earth, there's no possible scenario that I'd look back and say "I'm glad I spent all that time worrying about things." Either I did well and I'll move on, or I did poorly and I'll have to be held back a grade. It's like, it's pretty much up to me how things end up. And in the unlikely scenario that it's just nothing after this, and my consciousness ceases to exist, I want to have spent my time enjoying my life and learning the lessons that I'm supposed to be learning.

Honestly, it would a dream come true if he were to ask what I would do differently. Would love to explain that his approach to investing is not only no longer meta, but wasn’t even that pragmatic in the century when his advice kind of made sense. The general trend going back to the 70s has been invest diversely in financially sound large corporations that produce stable dividend growth, use those dividends and other discretionary capital to invest aggressively, reinvest, and compound exponentially over time. It allows you to you to swing your dick and have pussy too. 

For all the shit that Michael Milken got, the trend he noticed, that “non-investment grade bonds offered risk adjusted returns greater than that of an investment-grade scared pussy portfolio,” was valid, and can be applied to other asset classes. His 12% return talk is clearly bullshit, and his Evangelical investment advice is so stupid it upsets me to think about. 

Far be it for me to say someone’s beliefs or opinions are wrong... but his are wrong... and I don’t like him like as a human being... and his voice annoys me... and I hope he stubs his toe.

Is it possible that there is a plan for mutual funds and managed funds to dump 100 millions shares on the inclusion date? To help their index funds departments, and that they have already bought these shares in the last month. In this plan, both the mutual and managed funds win, riding the wave of retail hype coming up in the next few days

Contact the ombudsman. Their role is to investigate maladministration, so if they're really not giving you the information you need to contest this, the ombudsman should be able to help you. Even if they determine withholding the info was appropriate (unlikely), they should be able to give you a clearer understanding for why.

Closer to $90 - that's about where it bottomed out in the crash, and where it was a month before the crash.  Even if you argue there was news to justify it doubling to $180 pre-crash, there's really no good way to justify it going parabolic and now being worth almost 7 times as much in 9 months. 

That's financial magic or fuckery depending on how you view it, but has no basis in fundamentals unless you're functionally retarded and consider market momentum or gamma squeezes a fundamental.

And no, you can't price a car company as a tech company just to make the numbers look mildly less ridiculous - the technology sales are limited by the car units, so there's no way to justify a tech multiple as if you were selling software that could be downloaded by an infinite number of consumers with virtually no production time/cost.

This aligns with Daniel Kahneman’s judgement and decision making theory of there being 2 distinct cognitive systems that govern our decision making. 

>	The main thesis is that of a dichotomy between two modes of thought: "System 1" is fast, instinctive and emotional; "System 2" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates rational and non-rational motivations/triggers associated with each type of thinking process, and how they complement each other, starting with Kahneman's own research on loss aversion. From framing choices to people's tendency to replace a difficult question with one which is easy to answer, the book summarizes several decades of research to suggest that people have too much confidence in human judgement.

Feeling simultaneously content and worried about my solid gold bars at night.

Then when I’m feeling up for it, successfully trading some of the gold bars in person for something one day.

TA says this thing is going to pop next week. News is going to be all about PFE. MRNA decision is on 17th.  this should all be bullish for PLTR.

dont know if your 35 will print by Friday but I expect a pop into the 30s. maybe touch the ATH.

if it touches 35 I will open 1/15 $45-50 CC.  iF we pop that high then we will consolidate around 40s heading into Feb earnings. Last earnings was 52%  YOY quarterly rev growth. IF that number increases this thing is going to the fucking moon.
that is definitely one of the risks.... however one of square’s c-suite members jackie reese left square to be on PSTH advisory board, so many believe he could be making a play into a tech company if not even a fintech company

Or our brain, much like the rest of our body, is wired in perfect harmony to function correctly, but psychotropic drugs push one lever too far and we perceive reality differently
To me, $RYCEY does not look appealing at all - I'd say putting any money in the stock would be a total gamble. Adjusted for the distribution on Dec 1st, its low in October was around $0.60/share, and it's now at $1.66/share, around 250% of its value at that low. I couldn't imagine putting any money in the stock _after_ rising 250%. And even before Corona, Rolls-Royce was a financially engineered Frankenstein that developed inferior engines and was struggling to stay afloat. After Corona, they're saddled with many billions more of debt and all the other problems that you get with basically doing nothing for nearly two years. The other elephant in the room, of course, is that they basically only make money every time a giant plane flies, and nobody is going to be flying their giant planes until Corona is truly over. Domestic US flights, inter-EU flights, etc will come back far sooner than widespread transatlantic travel - and those shorter flights use far fewer RR engines. Look up routes for the big planes that use RR engines and you see routes like Dubai-Auckland, Tokyo-Paris, NYC-Seoul, etc. I don't think we'll be packing 615 souls in a cramped metal tube on those routes in a few months from now. Oh, and there's the whole Rolls-Royce scandal of "we couldn't sell enough engines, so we bribed officials in third world countries to buy them" which they just paid a billion dollars in fines for. 

$GIK is a tricky one. I like that they're actually building things unlike a lot of EV meme stocks that can border on fraud like, say, $NKLA. But that said, the question of which EV stocks skyrocket and which don't is a tough one, and a huge factor is "investor" (aka /r/wsb user) psychology. You're never going to get a cool video clip of retrofitting a delivery truck, and their CEO is some random guy with literally 381 followers on Twitter who wears badly fitting maroon (!) department store suit jackets. But that said, one thing I do like is that they're very well positioned for the current wave of electrification sweeping the US. There are tons of groups that want to buy something, and they want to buy it now: all the towns, companies, school districts etc that want to seem green and do something for the environment. Everyone else offers something you can buy years from now, but $GIK offers something you can buy _now_, and that is very appealing. Now, yes, you have the risk of buying an EV stock up 40% in an already pumped-up EV market, so don't put in money that you can't afford to take a serious haircut on, but I would say it has a good bit of growth potential. I'll have to take a closer look to decide if I want to put any money in myself.

Good luck on your investing journey, and have fun! Researching individual stocks really is an interesting and hands-on way to learn about the financial system and how it all works. Also, if you're new to this, I would highly, highly recommend the [Bloomberg Money Stuff newsletter by Matt Levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-09/there-are-extortion-backed-bonds-now) (when he's back from paternity leave, at least.)

Honestly ive been getting a lil bored myself. More and more been getting back to my old ways of just passively throwing money at etfs. Especially all of arks funds
I am saying let say you buy a 6 month leap...the appreciation does not happen in month 1 but in month 3, 4 or 5...Does the amplification of leaps value still stay above 3x in 3, 4 or 5 month...I doubt it considering the theta decreasing the value of the option.  So in this scenario maybe margin 3x or 4x makes more.

Ofcourse if appreciation happens right away fine.
same. scared my doc will think im a retard

I know it performs worse than just stock. But like I said I employ it for stock I would otherwise not buy. The other place is where I have a very strong read, i sell calls on tops and scoop them up at lows. Squeezes out a bit more yield.

upside or downside doesn't matter. the same exact logic applies to the downside. great, so the premium softens the blow if it goes down. so you write another call while it's down. then it goes back up again. but your upside is capped and you only get the premium, so you'd again lose out vs someone who bought and held (given RV>IV)

if you dont believe me you can backtest this in ORATS or any backtesting software. do it on TSLA, BABA, whatever stock. if you wheel'd TSLA the past few months you'd lose out on so much money compared to a buy&hold it's absolutely insane

So, I've been to my local GME numerous times, and it's always been a solid experience. I've also ordered from their site many, many, many times. They often have awesome deals on the most random-assed memorabilia that I didn't even know that I HAD to have. I mean a Star-Lord Helmet for 30 bucks? I'm in.

I want GME to survive and give ALL of us numerous tendies and memorabilia deals. That said, I ALSO want AMC to not shit the bed and get some life support until they can course correct or get bought out. We can make it happen :) 

Santa, if you're listening, we want motherfucking tendies, theaters, and nerd shit.

We're all in need of an Autist not a retard.

What's the correlation of the weekend POW vs upcoming market the following week.

Autists please advise
Pre-market exclusively.
The EV hype is still ongoing. Many have missed the initial EV train which already ran up by 100%/200%. Notwithstanding, I think what is important is to look for EV companies which are not competing with others directly. ELMS for one, is a first-mover in last mile delivery segment. Smart play of blue ocean strategy imo.

But you don’t take all the downside volatility. You keep the premium regardless. So take a stock like BABA, you can sell OTM premium for several percent-worth of the underlying. If the stock drops by that much you still break even.

I also understand what you’re saying, if realized volatility to the upside is greater you lose. As a short to medium term strategy though it’s very effective at squeezing out a few percent (if that meets your objectives).

I held BABA LEAPS, but after a strong run I took profits and switched to shares with covered calls. If it pulls back to what I think is a good level to go longer, I pull the calls back.

Your risk is correct. Even if you go pretty deep itm for your buy, a crash would destroy you. You're holding a decaying asset, relatively safe to be fair if your itm, but it has an expiry. If you were doing this in February you'd have had to diamond hand it through the whole crash and watch it get destroyed, and the post crash pump was beautiful but not something you should rely on in the future.

So basically if you're putting your whole account into leaps, it's a great way to get leverage and to pmcc, but it's not the safest. If we crash you lost everything. My shares I'm traditionally wheeling, however, will be fine. It'll look ugly as fuck while I baghold and wait for recovery, but it'll be alright eventually.
fuck, you jinxed it now. unfuck it now!

thats the thing; you take all the downside volatility with limited upside.

if it goes up more than the credit you received, great, you make money. then you write another call at a higher price and it finally goes down again, you lose more than someone who bought and held initially. this is what keeps happening if RV>IV which is often the case for volatile stocks like baba

so few people realize that options are a play on volatility and not neccessarily direction.

DIX is a measurement tracking dark market purchases/sales of stocks. A higher DIX value indicates large institutions are buying.  Higher than 45 suggests bullish market conditions for the next few weeks. 45 seems to be a key number. DIX can be viewed here https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix

VIX is a measurement tracking volatility. It *usually* is negatively correlated with SPY, higher VIX—>lower SPY. There are some exceptions to this rule

1) GME does not have exclusive selling privileges to the PS5. The hype is not the store but the product in which the most sold is on SNE direct.

2) Only reason people are walking into GME today is to get the consoles, nothing else. Their online presence is there but honestly crap compared to others.

3) you want to ride the hype to retardland? How about AMD... they supply the chips for both Xbox AND PS5. They literally have a monopoly on the console market.

Not what I was trying to say. I’m a conservative investor, so I wouldn’t want to outright own BABA in my portfolio. Up or down, it’s more volatile than my preferred profile. But with covered calls it becomes much less risky (though with less potential upside).

"Imagine buying SPXL when the market is overvalued", "Top is in. I loaded up on puts at close.", "PLTR is so overvalued, Jake Paul Morgan was right.", "Coronavirus hospitalization at all time high. Are you surprised?"

Europoors join in on the fun. Flat futures suddenly go to -0.65%.

Bears are foaming at the mouth now and it's getting weird.

"BULLS R FUK", "YOU BOUGHT CALLS AT THE TOP", "JPOW IS A FALSE GOD.", "I bought TSLA puts when the S&P inclusion news dropped. It's finally going to print.", "I WILL GARGLE ANIMAL SEMEN IF SPY HIT 350."

Or the rumor IS that it’ll crash, so buy?
the rate is significantly lower than what the credit cards would charge you. people who are financially irresponsible are going to take on more debt regardless, at least they provide a cheaper option for them to do so without snowballing out of control. how it works is that they dont charge you for penalties or whatsoever for late payments but if you want to take advantage of the cheap credit again, you get to pay it off first. my take on capital one banning payment on afterpay is they see it as a loophole to for people to not be charged the 19.99% compounded interest rate that they would normally charge people. i mean if it wasnt for the fact that credit debt rate is so damn high, companies like affirm wouldnt have existed in the first place.

It’s a good way to buy stocks that are more volatile than you would otherwise want to hold. But I agree with the point. I own mostly big ETFs, and do covered calls on risky tickers that I want a piece of.

1: Your photos are great, you need more variety. Close ups, wides, whatever. Just mix it up more. 

2: do you want to make beats or take photos? What do you wanna be hired to make beats or photos? 

Cause the people who need beats don’t want to hire a photographer to eb their producer, and the people who want to hire a photographer don’t want a beat maker to take their photos. 

If you want to do both, separate them into different websites. 


On your marketing note, you don’t need marketing. You take dope photos. Everyone wants a good photo of themselves. Go take every free photo you can. Target notable people in your area. Musicians, whoever interests you. They have followings, and need a stream of photos. Good work doesn’t need marketing. Word of mouth will take over from there, and you’ll start making bank.

I havent played with any GME yet, but wife and I were shopping today and walked by Gamestop in the mall and there were 5 or 6 people in there, not awful, but the mall was crowded as fuck so idk.

Then we drove by another one on the way home in a strip mall and I looked in as we drove by and there was literally 0 people in there while the parking lot was completely full of cars.

I get they have digital sales... but... after seeing that there is no way I'm touching it.

If you guys manage to make more money off of it then I'm happy for ya.
it's also a relatively new vaccine variant (mRNA) and there's a big logistical challenge with trying to get it out.  so yeah, if I had bought any, I'd want to let them go sometime between now and when the distribution really kicks off.

Not on Robinhood yet since its OTC. However, once it does get listed on the Nasdaq, this thing is going to take off. Not to mention, they are experimenting on multiple drugs including LSD, Shrooms, MDMA, etc.
Tbh I understand where those selfish people are coming from. Everyone is dealing with their own shit, and it takes a lot to bear other people's emotional problems. Plus happy and charismatic people pull other people up, and that's what they look for.

My stitch fix today was incredibly disappointing. 3 sweaters, 1 coach jacket and 1 knock off shoes. Not a single pair of pants and this is my 3rd box. The sweaters are pretty high quality though so I'll get another box and ask for a few pants I guess. The shoe is absolutely shitty though, vans knockoff and it makes you look poor.

First, sorry to hear that. Second, is your timely demise recorded? You should consider loans/debt, get as much as you can and throw it into 1 weekly play. Tesla is pretty volatile but you might not make much due to IV. Maybe wait for a juicy earnings play and buy 2 or 3 weeks out.
It seems really informative though, sorry for the down syndrome votes

You could replace Musk with more than a handful of other renowned celebs and your statement would still hold true.
How'd you calculate 10.4? Prospectus removes commissions/discounts from original per share fee putting it at \~9.65 iirc. The interest rate would have to be 4% in the two years to be 10.4. Who's getting 4% risk free interest? Lol

Honestly not as bad of a play than what I thought when I first read your comment. An 80 million market cap really intrigues me. With how retarded retail investors are (buying stock splits because now they can afford the lower number) and the endless liquidity I think any and every SPAC will pump to at least a 500 mil valuation.

Im a little over 5’11 almost 6’0

180 was with a 285x1 bench, 345 x 1 squat, 415 deadlift in college. Also second year of college 😂 I can’t believe the me from college anymore, like I could get shitfaced at night and come in and knock out a PR in the morning no problem. Wish I still had that kind of energy

When I graduated my long term gf broke up with me, started traveling for work etc I ballooned up to 260. I did get back to 190 a couple years later on normal dieting and heavy lifting, tore my meniscus in my left knee and had surgery, and then I never really got back into it. My knee is fine now though I just got fucking lazy

My whole life’s been a yo-yo with my weight, even though I could be in better shape, I guess I’m lucky that I caught what I was heading to early before I was 240 and/or 260 again. Like a month ago I was a size 38 and now a 36 just gotta keep my head straight

I’ve had my PS4 controller since the beginning, 7 years ago, and I’ve only dropped it twice on its entire life. Both times were a month ago because of Bloodborne (fuck you shark giants). I’m replaying TLOU1 and my L2 button was acting like trash that it was almost unbearable. I tried restarting the controller but no luck and was thinking if I need to buy a new one. I decided if I should drop it again on the floor so I did and now it’s completely back to normal.

Hell, I sat for a minute thinking I'd get more Scrabble points with retard. The truth hurts.

Yeah that’s a really solid strategy. Covered calls especially is just such a reliable way to generate gains. Definitely not as “fun” as purely directional plays but I would bet over a reasonable timespan you’re coming out on top of most everyone playing a direction.
Haven’t seen any estimates put out myself, but I’d be pleasantly surprised if anyone under 50 that isn’t a healthcare worker can get it before  beginning of June

I dunno I mean it is tsla so anything stupid can happen.  But I think if it rallies into the buy in big then look out for possibly a big reversal.  Who really wants to be buying tsla up here?  The big players look to buy in on weakness.  If it sells off this week prior to the buy in then maybe we see a buy the dip.  But I think I would be looking for a long trade at 650 break possibly Monday maybe a move to 700 or 800 into the buy in would probably set up a nice short back to 600.  But this is all just fucking speculation I have no fucking idea what it's going to do.  But that's my guess.  Buying it at 800 seems like a dumb idea if somehow we make it up there. There will be sellers that bought in at 460 and 500 ready to unload.

I know, it's fucking perfect, right?

When I first started I bought shares in spy. I left one in afterwards just for an easy reference to compare to my portfolio.

Obviously not the norm but it’s also the fact I bought a fixer upper and did the work. At those prices I can almost guarantee you’re trying to buy a move in ready house at or above market value which is never a good investment. Plenty of deals out there if you’re willing to do the work. I have my eyes on a few duplex’s but they’ll be long sold before I sell my place in the spring

I've tracked a few bots on here that try to sway sentiment, but this throws me off. 

On the one hand, OP posts poll after poll, precisely four minutes apart, day after day. Some of his responses in those poll threads are extremely over-elaborate, and he never shows anger. On the other hand, he is patching together complex information on SPAC tickers with relevant trade/merger dates and prices in natural language. His image patching is not as sophisticated.

I cannot tell if OP is the best SPAC-fomo bot ever or just a random SPAC and poll loving psychopath!

2 years ago sure but as someone trying to buy a home in Cleveland this year, its been a shitty situation. Havd been out bid on 11 houses. Last house I offered 280 on 260 listed and it sold for 340. The markets pretty inflated right now. Which is why your home is worth 20k more right now, not the norm for appreciation though.
Hmmm don’t do that buddy. Put the money towards your biz not options. Then when you make bank come back and yolo millies lol

You watch her as she brushes her hair. She’s humming a song you can’t quite hear and smiling to herself. Not for the first time, you wonder why this person chose you.

She turns. “What do you want for Christmas?” You want to scream *Save your money!*, but you only shrug. “Nothing, really.”

“Nothing?” She crawls into bed and touches your leg. “Are you sure?” Again, you wonder why this person chose you.

As she takes the weight of you in her hand, your mind wanders. To your puts. They’ll expire worthless, like you. After several minutes of failing to conjure your manhood, she asks, “What’s wrong?”

Stonks only go up.

My approach is 95% or more stocks. I actively trade covered calls on them, so I sell premium when I’m bearish, and buy it back when bullish or neutral. Gives me a chance to actively manage without short term gains on the long term position. 

The rest is a few percent in LEAPS and a bit of gambling money. My portfolio doesn’t move that fast as a result, but it’s worked well for me.

Agreed. More so, I want to see Cohen show these boomers what he’s made of.
I'm a novice at this and can't understand the screenshot. Did you trade stocks or options? Only reason I ask is that I've traded stocks and have seen a return of 110% in 6 months (small potatoes I know, wait till you see what I actually put in the market). I'm thinking of starting to trade options, but if this can be achieved by stock, then i'll stick with my current strategy and put in more money.

Hey nice! Fuck you
Im not overly familiar with the iv rank on tqqq so hasnt been a consideration. Im also literally all in on this thing and wanted to put capital to work asap so ive been more concerned with protecting my downside by never being just lonf the shares - have sold the calls immediately after i buy the shares to have that protection. 

If you are comfortable being just long the shares for the price appreciation, you could sell calls at your preferred strike then for obviously a lot more premium. Im also not allowed to sell puts, but i would recommend starting there so you can get assigned the shares at a lower cost basis and then maybe wheel from there. 

Im yoloing in a safer way (~10% per month) so you wont get wsb explosive multibaggers doing this. But this is the most aggressive theta strat ive been able to execute with good win rate. The most potent way to do this would probably be to sell covered strangles, in which case you could probably double what im doing but obviously there’s a larger risk of assignment and thats a pretty big capital commitment if it happens.
Dude. It’s brake pads.
[deleted]
Why sell long term calls? Have you seen what LEAPS can do? 
Wait for MSFT to hit 30 day, buy 1 year calls. It’s 30 day is most likely going to be higher at some point in the next 6-9 months. Hold as long as you can.

I’m inclined to agree with you, however in these markets I can’t be sure anymore.
There was a DD post of CRSR being extremely undervalued, held widely by big firms, and have a P/S ratio of 2, compared to LOGI which sells similar products at a P/S of 4. 

If you use google trends CRSR has been in an uptrend for years, and has peaked in the past month (holiday quarter spike maybe) 

On technical side it touched 32.60 which touched a gap support, and RSI is low. If there is no broader market sell off, I think CRSR will go meaningfully higher. 

Anecdotal side, my brother bought a Corsair RGB light headstand for 150 (not even headphones, it’s just a headstand) CRSR 🚀

Yeah...

Kind of gets to another point I’ve thought about recently. I call it negative stress equity lol. Even if you happen to overcome the tax adjustment with short term gains or if you withstand the urge to dump leaps before they get past the 1 year mark, the average person is subjecting themselves to a considerably larger amount of stress to do so. I think you also have to factor that into the overall equation.

Not really kosher on here but it does seem to come back to the “buy and hold” approach being the best overall for the average investor. Maybe throw in a couple calls here and there for fun but play with 5-10%, not your whole bankroll.

I’ve been in and out on the lifting side, the strength definitely does come back quick

I’m doing the Rapid Fat Loss version of a PSMF. It’s about 700 calories a day, almost no fats or carbs, just protein and fiber veggies with some supplements. I’ve been on it for a month now it gets easier as it goes. It’s supposed to be used for crash dieting for powerlifters and such but can also be used to kick off diets or other things like what I’m doin

I went from 240 to 180 from HS into college, that 180 I was fucking ripped and where I wanna be again. I initially kicked that dieting off with the PSMF so I’m repeating it again. I started a month ago at 212, was 198 this morning, probably closer to 203 just adding 5 lbs of water back

But even if I get back to 180 the muscle mass just isn’t the same as being in college and lifting every day feelsbadman

the most basic TA can help you pick entries and exits, don't go overboard with it

for swing trading I use RSI on the daily and 4 hr charts, I try to enter when RSI is low and exit when RSI is  high, but it is just an indicator -- you can do this and it can go the other way, it's part of a larger strategy

Lots of exploitation going on in India, in the name of pandemic. The family I work for is in high margin business as high as 35%. They earned a lot over the years and stashed their fortunes in real estate and other assets. Labour used to work in two shifts, with pandemic as an excuse, they laid off 2nd shift employees and asked the 1st shift employee to work both shift for same wages. Even though demand has already picked up. They lay off anyone raising their voice. I have a professional qualification and a senior and hence they didn't touch my salary. But it pains me to see my brotheren suffer for the greed of a few.

Post a comparison.
there's two different surgeries. both have low risk of infection but the one i'm talking about is they make a small incision to put an implant under the skin. it's similar to breast implant except has even lower risk of infection than that. I think you guys are thinking about the surgery where they ligate the ligament
I read both as “Retard”
This dude lol.  So your at 2000 shares x 5.00 is 10,000.  Assuming your delta is 99.9 percent. Depending on where you live that’s gonna be about 7500.00 after federal taxes.  Unless you have state taxes which would bring you down to roughly 5800.  Yea real close to million. I hope that’s not a yolo for you.

There is the risk that the price rises above the short call and he has to close both legs for a net loss, not a huge loss, but a loss nonetheless. The bigger risk tho would be if the price dropped enough, that the short call premium doesn’t cover the loss in value of the long contract. Hopefully the expiry on the long contract would be far out enough that the price would bounce back. But then you’re stuck selling calls so far OTM to avoid getting assigned below the strike price of the long that you’re not making any significant money. So it looks like to me the long side needs to be bought deeper ITM and the covered calls need to be sold further OTM to reduce risk so the return would be much less than 1.6% a week. If I understand correctly, basically a big move in either direction could net a loss. I think the max loss would be the difference in the price of the 2 contracts.

It's weird watching internet communities die and losing those "friends." You never really know the people but the community lives and breathes almost like a normal town. There are the known trolls and pranksters. The serious and the clowns. And a swift ban for disrespectful outsiders. This isn't about WSB specifically, but I think I get how the old-old schoolers felt. Their community got invaded and eventually lost its character. Nobody knows who's who anymore and the revolving door keeps turning. Eventually all identity will be lost and the place goes to the great archive in the sky.

I don't know why it feels so dramatic losing a message board I stopped visiting eight years ago. Maybe it's because we never followed through on that irl meet up and now the chance is forever gone. RIP old school oppo.

It's news about the company. Thought you may not have seen it and wanted to share.
Yeah it would, that's why I asked. I usually don't want to be long when that happens. Sometimes it's mild other times it drops significantly. I grabbed puts on RPRX this week for that reason but RPRX is a unique situation.

Say you bought 100 shares of a company @  $50/share. You can sell a call expiring that week at a strike of $50+* and guarantee you'll not lose money (on that sale). If the stock is moving modestly you can easily sell $56-60 calls expiring the following week for a buck or so and not have to worry too much by being upset you're out of your position while it's taking off.

*if the stock is breaking out or IV is ridic you can sell at strikes lower than your cost so long as the added premium is greater than the difference btwn stike and your cost

If you're neutral or even slightly (short term) bearish you can sell closer to or at the money calls

That’s why you keep them chained and gagged in the closet. Feed them through an IV and have them folding clothes 24/7

I will be 100% transparent... as a guy who sold TSLA too soon... these prices scare me but still adding to CMPS. There are others but most are still penny stocks (100-500m market cap)that you can find on other boards. 

Next year ATAI Life goes public and I will get more of that (I have some pre ipo).

Again, I sold TSLA too soon so I guess it will all go up.

Just do what I do. Use one garbage bag for dirty clothes, and one garbage bag for clean clothes. No folding required.

Yeah but I need to see how the price moves premarket to know what strike I’m gonna buy. If it moves up again past where we’re at bow I’m going to go with the 22.5s for later in the year. We stay relatively near 19.20 I’ll get more of the 20s for Jan.

not too ambitious. GM is doing all sorts of EV shit so it's hard to say when news comes out but it will. anyway you can always sell the options earlier when they go up like 60% or 100% or so

this doesnt look like options at all. it looks like you were holding momentum stocks like NET, any cloud/tech, from March. nice but why say it's from options? if you were sitting on TSLA calls since march like you say in the comments you'd be up like 2000% not 200%

lots of momentum stocks have gone up 200-500%+ since march, did you play stocks or options? if options how is the gain the same as if you did it with stocks?

True but some of my best days are bear days.  Wednesday I made 25k and I was shorting tsla.  Thursday I made 12k some how buying puts in tsla even though it barely had much of a sell off.  I traded through the sell offs in March as well profitably.  I'm not just buying calls on meme stocks every day and praying.  Hell you can do that in this market and it can still not work. Just look at PLTR when it was at 32.

TIL bears can make money in this market
I wonder what about when controlling for how far out the money the strike is, IV, underlying market cap, open interest, volume, etc. I get the basic logic of it - the majority of calls expire worthless, and the gains of those that expire ITM arent enough to compensate for the overall net loss of premiums on short term call options... but there are still so many variables to consider. 

I wonder if you just cut out the way out of the money options how much of a difference that would make because given enough time even a small drag like cheap far out of the money options is enough to, when given enough time, make an account go to zero. Lots of interesting nuances and subtleties to consider I would think.
