Sometimes I feel like a retard for blindly following the advice of some random on the internet.

[But my CIIC shares are up 50% so who am I to argue with results?](https://imgur.com/2SuDEHM)
didn't read shit  
ALL IN BABY

Bought 200 shares and barely understand what it is. Something about batteries.

So we buy THCB shares?

SECTOR ROTATION FROM CIIC to THCB Confirmed!
WSB runs this stock now.
Jesus Christ.  
My account is now 60% EVs, or EV related shit.

Dude thanks to you I made so much money on CIIC, Ill follow you anywhere
Should I sell CIIC or hold?
Lol I cant believe I finally followed the DD of this sub.  Im destined to get fucked on this, OP.  I know it.  You know it.  The meager and blind know it.  


YOLO
If this is under $12 at market open I will drop $500k and post proof.

DCAd AH and I could only get 40k common to fill. Proof: https://postimg.cc/HrLn7bmX

Jumping in for 100 shares
Warrants ticker is THCBW correct
Thanks you intelligent fucker. You made me money on CIIC. 

Loaded up THCB. Riding your SPAC waves.
Also, what's your exit price target for this? $20s?

EDIT: you answered the question in your post. My bad.
I have no idea what is going on, but fuk I am in
50 shares in, what am I doing
What is the whole 10 dollar thing with spacs? How does that work?
You retards moved the price 3 percent.
4100 THCBW at 1.35
Never bought a warrant in my life and now I own 1500. Good luck boys.
I saw your dd on CIIC. Bought some shares instead of weed. 10/10 decision. Would buy THCB shares but already balls deep in pltr for the long haul - got no more dick to give :(

Edit: Fuck it low floor risk taking all my CIIC shares and dumping them into the THCB. Double my weed money bb

Appreciate the work. I'll do a dive in myself after I look into it tonight.

#ALL IN BB 
Solid find. I really like this. Agreed that it has far more room to run than CIIC, let's rock and roll.
bought at the top, 1000 shares @ 10.50

you made me bands last tile, hope youre right again retard
Sounds good, I just put 2k in on an internet strangers word that theres no downside... I might be a retard, but Id rather be rich and retarded than lower middle class and smart!
In for 800 warrants as a punt 
#HOLY FUCKING SHIT IM IN
Just went in on 500 shares
I like when you speak words I dont understand. locking in 1000 AH

Edit: Went 1500 shares on a margin. YOLO
You have earned the WSB autist stamp of approval. I will follow you until I lose money, then I will call you a pump and dump con artist. 
Yep Im in. Still holding CIIC though, Arrival are a decent company
Im wondering if the green dick in the 5m chart is from this post....
It just spiked. good call...
I am tired of missing out of gains, and for that reason, I'm in.
I like it. Nice call. Surprised it has not rocketed yet as it is both a play on SBE and Chinese EV stocks.
Tldr 

Im in for 500 shares
Blind leading the blind, fuck it Im in
Got in CIIG at $15, just sold most of my shares. MY HOMIE SAID THCB, I'M IN 650 SHARES
Dumped my entire 401k in this after getting ciic at 16 bless your soul
Blind leading the blind...I'm in
Average volume is 900k

&#x200B;

Volume today is almost 4 million.

&#x200B;

wow
In for 30 shares for the lolz you beautiful retard.
150 shares, YOLO?
Another one I read the other day: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvast-talks-public-via-tuscan-025740433.html
Im up $22k on CIIC, so why not. Go big or go home - Im in for 5,000 shares.
First time blindly following advice from an anonymous internet poster. In for 1200 shares @ $10.50! As of right now, might be the first of many . . . Up to $11.26 after hours!
100 shares easy
Just read through everything.  Im in for 500 at $10.52.  This may be a dumb question. But is the risk still implied if you buy stocks and not warrants?  Im ok robinhood so no warrants.  Should it still hover around $10 no matter what
300 warrants fuck it
You had me at EV - bought 100 warrants
Just bought in. You threw me a solid with CIIC
Blah blah blah... 


I'm IN
just from the name alone i know its gonna get high.
This is literally the thesis for the CIIC play except it's even earlier
 I'm in for 20 shares.
You deserve a medal !
you killing me dude lol all my stocks doing lovely. should i liquidate and move positions or just add more money in
im in at 95 shares at about 10.52ish .. im strapped in for the ride
I like my odds here so Im depositing $200 to put in this. Maximum loss of $10 with max gains of $100-$200 being decently likely. Thats one thats worth going in on.
Just bought 1000 shares. Let's see what happens
I found this one Friday and feel like Ive discovered gold.  Good luck everyone
Didnt even read and Im in 350 shares
In for 40 shares only ( new to bring a retard, can't go full retard yet). What's your sell off point if you don't mind me asking?
*pretend i am new,* what exactly is a warrant? You made me 400 on CIIC already which for a college student is lots of booze
Your a fucking genius man
Sometimes your balls just tingle reading a good DD and thats when you know u gotta go in balls deep. This is a good DD and i dropped 10 gs today and its already up 5% AH.

Thank you lord autist
Its already up 12% from opening bell.
No idea what youre talking about, but I just bought 30 shares and 70 warrants. New retard has joined the gang!!!
In for 40 shares. Lets go boys
200 shares 
Okay but you owe me $4 if merger fails. 

Jokes aside. Your DD on CIIC actually made me a decent bit of money so Im in. Did you already exit your CIIC position?
dude wtf this stonk is up 4% 

now i have fomo
To the moon op
I'm in for 100 shares at $10.50, same goes for GIK.
In on 2000 warrants and 300 shares
CIIC was legit. 

&#x200B;

Got 335 THCB shares because I'm poor.
i bought 3070 shares because i did not want to read and 6 hours later i noticed you said 30|70 split... hrm..either way reading is over rated...thaank you
Im selling my house for this so I can all in
Put 9 on it boys, last chance to win my blind daughter some better food or its beans again !
bought another 1500 shares just now after hours @ 11.47
I picked this up at 10.50 and it was already up 10% at about 7pm. Good job pumping this thing already boys 
Man, you single handed sky rocketed the price of this stock to 11+

You understand that if this works again, next time you will have the authority to pump any low volume stock you want.
You had me at EV SPAC

Well, its only money, Im in for 100 shares.

Im in with 200 shares at just under 9
Didn't read the articles but fuck it im in
Just bought 150 shares. Hope you're right!
How easy is it too recoup the 10? Would shares just never drop below that cuz it's what they're worth and i could just sell whenever?

I wont have money for this until tomorrow and itll probably be at 11.50... Im debating if it will still be worth it
I trust you with my life
I just read two articles on it and found no projection of merger finalization. It is entirely possible I missed it. How did you come up with two weeks from now?
Why shares and not calls
- just realized they might not have options but havent checked
God damn it. 100% in.
OK i read THCB bought 10 stocks and came back so id give a shit about the DD
50 shares in, what am I doing
bought 100 shares before reading this - glad it's getting some more attention :)
Fly me to the moon  I bought 1k
Great one. Just put 25% of my portfolio on this. Let's ride!
Bought a few shares a bit ago, Ill see how your play runs out.
Fuck it im in. Sold the CIIC I acquired today for THCB, lets run it to $20
My broker doesn't allow me to buy this wtf it says it's blocked.

So basically in Holland you need an EID IN DUTCH TO GIVE "INVESTORS" A WAY TO COMPARE STOCKS. 

I just follow papa op and it makes more than their retard investors.
This guy deserves to be listened to, he made us all money!
I'm in
so its 20 dollars on sale for 10 until december. got it. loaded up.
Yeah the timing of this post and the THCB chart checks out.
I like it. Pissed I missed CIIC. In here for a small position, shares and warrants.
Going in on this fellow Retard
Hi SPACman, quick thanks for getting me 50% returns with CIIC. What are your thoughts on the SPAC $LGVW and Butterfly's ultrasound tech?
Bought 250 shares. Yolo bitches.
Just grabbed 126 shares. Lets ride!
Lets gooooooooooo

https://i.imgur.com/r5R7AW9.png
Ok I'm in for 125 shares
>EDIT: **it is NOT a cannabis/weed stock. It is a SPAC to merge with a EV battery maker.**

Woopsie
this mans DD is legit boys pile in
I got 1k shares when dood mentioned this last week, now up to 2200 shares and up 500 already... moving a little capital to webull so i can yolo into warrants
Thcb stands for thick bae,
You definitely want it
I just want to say thanks again brother for the awesome fucking play on CIIC!!!! I made $2000 in less than 3 days! Is it time to cash out or hold for a bit? I saw that Cramer basically called it out on his show, so Im thinking its time to take profits, right?
yolo'd my account on warrants. took profits from PLTR today, thanks for the DD!
Thanks...bought 1k shares...did some cursory DD and looks promising...let's see what happens
Rock solid DD. So do I sell some of my NIO (over 300 shares, avg. $37/share ) and yolo into this SPAC or wait for my next paycheck (which takes another week) and yolo that into this play? Autism intensifies.
Well damn. I might have to throw more money in this bitch.
Went with the warrants.   Higher risk, higher reward.
Picked up a starter position to see how it goes. May add warrants later. http://imgur.com/a/nawSnoV
Im in! Lets go
For every 5 cents THCB gains I take another pop...
Going hard AF
thanks bro @ /u/computerTE1996
Bought $100 at 12:30 today. Thank you.
200 commons at 11.30 lets fucking goooooo
The crazy part is they have a liquidation date of 12/31/2020 (get back $10 per share) if the merger doesn't go through so there's very limited downside risk. I really like this trade because it has a built in stop-loss. +2,000 shares
Bought 100 shares of CIIC after being in SPAQ and reading your DD. Thank you for your service, up 65% in 5 days lol
I love that this website is a modern day pump and dump scheme.

 Bought hundreds of shares.
In for 40k common shares just over $11. Lets do this retards! https://postimg.cc/HrLn7bmX
I don't know about the financials of the company, but the stuff you wrote about the batteries are wrong. LTO never replaces LFP. LTO is anode material and LFP is a cathode material and a battery needs both of them, so you only replace anode with another anode material and same thing for the cathode. Conventional anode material in most lithium-ion batteries is graphite, so it is possible to replace it with LTO. This improves the power capability (charging time) and life of batteries, but you lose energy (more batteries needed to cover the same distance) compared to graphite. Also, for cathode materials LFP is cheaper hence the low cost not like what you said about swapping stations. Finally, for EVs most common cathode chemistries are NCM (most EVs) and NCA (Tesla). LFP is also used, but I would call it the most common. It has lower energy density, so it is used in larger systems where volume is not as crucial as in smaller vehicles where you need to pack a lot of energy into small space.
First off please tell me you werent born in 1996.

Secondly your link to the ROE is cringy as fuck. That is referencing the spac shell company, not the fucking target company. Half that shot for these companies is inaccurate. Good god. The fact that this has several hundred comments and not one person has noticed this speaks volumes.

You are a retard. That said I like the company so lets ride.
1,000 shares in a heartbeat due to asymmetry and endmarket growth. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
In for 100 shares
In for 30. On the train
in for 50 shares / 100 warrants. thanks for DD
I love that this is close to NAV and the target company is solid. Picked up some commons - thanks!
In for 250 wish me luck
Sold to the man with DD!
FUCKIT. Im in.

Lol thanks to you i made some money  i
i'm in for 100 shares!
This guy knows things I dont and it makes me money every time so far so Im in.
lol I am in, missed out on CIIC.
Already got 2000 shares of THCB, might add more depending on how it goes, though i think their merger deadline is coming up? OP can you verify this? I think i read it somewhere they only have a month or two to make this work, but not sure if thats true or not.
In for 500 shares. Lets go bby
Thanks bro. 

Doubled my money on the last one so I'm fuckin in.
In 100
yup, why not.  I'm in.
Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, but were looking at Tuscan Holdings?  I couldn't find anything on microvast
When is the merger to be announced ?

Nvm
fuck it. Going in
Spacs are free money if you get the timing pretty well. Even if you don't, the odds are in your favor
For those who want to get the details about the THCBW (warrents) you can find that info there: [https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-19-002379/](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-19-002379/)
i just bought some
Whats the % chance this doesnt go through?
Thanks for dinner, I can now afford more Wendy's tendies if my wifes bf allow me to take the car
Wtf this Moines today so ciic money going to thcb?
Sounds good to me random guy on the internet. YOLO ALL IN
It's an EV With a hint of WEED stock hybrid
Real robinhood!
Uh ISS. Theyve found out about our tendies. Bullish?
Fuck, Im in for a 1000 shares.
Why do you always DD stocks that don't offer options? :(
fuck it I'm in
Picked up 300 shared @ 10.50. Even if shit hits the fan, the price floor is only 50 cents away. A maximum of a 4% loss is the best worst case scenario I've held
So essentially if I buy a warrant I would trade it just like purchasing a share of the stock? Or is the price Im paying for the warrant equivalent to a premium on a 11.5C in 2026? As the underlying value of THCB increases this premium THCBW increases just like the option would. Is that accurate?
How long do merges usually take? I can see this deal falling through and this DD being useless.
Why can't I find THCB on a stock list? I'm using 212
Have to wait 7 days for funds to clear on Robinhood am I fucked
How do you figure out the terms of the warrant?  Read something that indicated this is 1:1 ratio, $11.50 per share is that correct?
Can you redeem cash for the warrants if it doesn't go through, or does that only apply to the common shares?
Any major OEM/auto partners backing Microvast? Can't seem to find anything on their website. A competitor like KCAC has VW backing, and the two are arguably direct competitors.
THCB? I cant even find their website ?
So if I was to but $20k worth of shares and it falls below $10 without the merge how would I redeem to get back $10/share?
>it is NOT a cannabis/weed stock. It is a SPAC to merge with a EV battery maker

On Robinhood it's description for THCB:
>Tuscan Holdings Corp. Common Stock, also called Tuscan Holdings, is a blank check company, which focuses in searching a target businesses in the cannabis industry.

But that's the right one to buy right? It just says that because it didn't update properly?
Im a freakin retard

In for 300 shares
buying THCB or THCBW?
Your edit says its not a cannabis stock but I keep reading that its in the cannabis industry, what am I missing?
I bought 187 shares at close. Lets go retards!
I'm a retard what are warrants
First time following a DD. In for 1000 @ $10.81
anyone know a european broker that features this stock? I've been using etoro so far and it doesn't have it. Thanks in advance for your help!
How long to hold ciic you think?
First time buying from listening to someone on this sub! Lets get it!!
What the fuck is a warrant
remindme! 3 weeks
certainly a better play than my spy pytz
So how fast do you want to get out of these plays?
Whats the difference between THCB warrants and shares?  And how do I go about purchasing them on RH?  All I see is THCB the stock
Is it crazy Im considering buying based off of how many retards upvote positive comments and give awards
Im all in! I just made 1k in one day with your CIIG recommendation. I should have bought more shares.
300 shares, 700 warrants. What did I just do?!
So, do you think ciic is at the top now and reposition Into THCB?
Why does the company only have two employees lol
already up 500$
Good enough for 300 shares.
Are warrants not available on Robinhood?
It's going to plunge now as I buy in
We have to keep this guy a secret!!
What's the difference with THCB and THCA? Looks like two different mergers?
how do you know that they are going to do merger agreement?
What is the catch? If the market doesn't like the deal or they mess up the merge somehow, stocks drop like a rock?
Is it too late for ciic? My platform doesnt have thcb yet :(
15k-66/33 split between shares and warrants

Lets ride!
Warrants get wiped to 0 if merger falls thru right ? Im omly trying plays that have a chance of 0
Too late to go in tomorrow morning?
OP whats your opinion on HCAC?
The website looks like some compsci students wordpress page. It's got broken links and super generic filler content. It's got Chinese scammer vibes.
why would a weed company merge with a EV battery company
Whats your thoughts on NCAB?
Fuck it I'm in
Im in with 330 shares at 10.62.
To be clear, its called Tuscan holdings? On Robinhood it says its a cannabis company?

And this is a free money play?
See you guys in 2 weeks i could only get like 56 shares ;d
How do we buy warrants?
I'm in just for fun. BRRRRRR
so should we buy warrants or no? when i read 30/70 split i thought you meant in terms of money put in so i got 300 shares and 4000 warrants but now that seems pretty risky
!RemindMe 1 week
Fuck it im in
I'm going to buy warrants for the first time on it. Only got shares on CIIC last time but I'm a retard and want some leverage. Anything special to know about warrants? I see the strike is 11.50 5 years after merger and they seem to be pretty similar to a call option on a single stock.
I cant find this stock on trading 212, any ideas why?
I only got $3k left I dont know what positions to reduce to put more money into this, VZ is probably not worth holding in small amounts since its a dividend machine right? In order of market value: 
150 MSFT, 25 TSLA, 50 BA, 500 APXT, 200 ICLN, 100 PFE, 50 VZ, 50 INTC, 50 VTRS, 10 PLTR

VZ is my first one to kill honestly, I know thats a lot of MSFT but it gets me through bad days of other stocks and Ill have to pay taxes on it if I dont rebuy
How do you get the warrants?
How do warrants work?
In for 400 shares!
Should I put 4k into thcb, or 1k into each thcb, gik, lgvw, and apxt????? 

Edit: I as in a friend, I'm asking for a friend 
Lets ride
remindme! 14 days
>NEW YORK, Nov. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Tuscan Holdings Corp. (Nasdaq: THCB) ("Tuscan") today confirmed that it has signed a letter of intent ("LOI") related to a business combination with Microvast Inc., a market leading provider of next-generation battery technologies for commercial and specialty use electric vehicles ("Microvast" or the "Company").  
  
What the fuck am I missing here? This isn't a rumor, this is the news
Looked into their annual report (9/30/20). Looks like this is a ride or die SPAC with a limited life time...

>The Company will have until **December 7, 2020** to complete a Business Combination (the Combination Period). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) **cease all operations** except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to **pay franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any)**, subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Companys remaining stockholders and the Companys board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Companys obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. **There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Companys warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period**.
whats the difference between shares and the warrants?

did i make a mistake buying shares?

sorry im retarded
https://www.pv-magazine.de/2020/07/02/tesla-effekt-in-brandenburg-microvast-baut-europazentrale-in-ludwigsfelde-auf/

Edit: Use the Translate Page function, retards.
What are your thoughts on GIK?
Do I buy THCB or THCBW? Sorry I am a retard
I'm a retard, what does this mean:

> like most SPACs, you can redeem shares to $10 cash if it fails through, which is unlikely to happen.
Question. Is it THCB or THCBW? And i can't find the ticker for microvast?
Warrants not on Rh?
Why does Robinhood say its a cannabis stock?
so do i have to buy a share of THCA and then a share of THCB to get paid 10$ back if merger fails? i dont get it lol i am stupid
Say less
No options at this casino guys
So wait, this isn't the THCB on RobinHood!?
whats thcbu then?
Thcb literally mooned
In at 200 shares you had me at EV
Nice dd
I'll buy in once ownership changes. If they sign the merger deal and announce that management will be replaced  (Like Trevor Milton and Nikola) by a competent team then I'll be all in. If they don't replace the management expect more self dealing and fraud in China.  Until then I'm waiting on more news until I buy.
u/ComputerTE1996 , I got 50 shares of dkng. Do you think this is going to do anything exciting in the near future, or should i sell and put into this? Ive been considering letting it go, but whats your personal opinion.
No options
Can you wise folks please enlighten me as to how to perform this ritual called DD ?
Genuine question... Why are they so many different THCBs. Theres also THCBU and THCA... which is also Tuscan Holding.
!RemindMe 10 days
Do you mind explaining the SPAC and the $10 stock floor thing?
I'm in NGA, you should too
I can see THCA and THCB, is B the warrant?
Go in now? Or wait one or two days after it went up 7% today?
Lol green candle is 100% from you guys
This company is being pumped and dumped. Literally everywhere.
XPEV up 20% today, LI 15%

No need to look for share only SPACs.
no options and for that reason I'm out i dont have enough collateral
Doesnt let me buy warrants? Saying you can only liquidate it
I was thinking we can basically buy any empty spac now for $10 like newborn acquisition inc they did not move all week last week and today they jumped 10% because people are just buying empty spacs and waiting it is like the tech IPO period every ipo doubled until it did not. Just ride the wave.
Chances stock drops below $10 after merger? Plz dont hurt me for this noob question senpai.
Remind me in 1 day
The market cap is under 1b, this is against WSB rules.
What are warrants
LGVW > Microvast
This company has two employees...
Dont they only invest in weed? Thcb?
Yep, riding the wave.  Just keep rolling with it.  It'll work until it doesn't
I'm scared, I bought 1,000 shares and 5,000 THCBW
This mother fucker got me into CIIC before it went to the moon! I bought in on THCB before seeing this post today and now that u/ComputerTE1996 is in Im stoked. Thanks for your direction on CIIC, big ups!
Same here. I only spent $1000 on ciic because its some random guy on the internet, but I was able to sell it for $1400 today and so now I spend $1400 on thcb
Bought warrants, up 40% today. I am pleased.
I made 70% return on STOCK on CIIG
way up AH as well
this is the way
Picked up $20k. Ill drop another $20k each day it doesnt tank. Good luck to us!
I fucking love all of you bastards <3 <3 <3
Just show me the ticker
I am a retard
Can't be any worse than corn.
Can I offer you some  to sweeten the deal?
Hundred here...
200 shares at $10.5 on my end
I think they make like the gas tanks for electric cars or something. I'm in.
you start at a couple hundred, take profits, buy a few more in the next thing to run. rinse and repeat.
I did just snagged 250 at 10.43
Yessir this post just forced me to buy 200
Isn't that a pot company
why does it say it's a weed/cannabis stock?
Lets fucking ride
2k shares, lets go
Me too, if it ain't broke don't fix it i guess.
I love the way Chinese EV moves. It just grinds up all day. No major dips or spikes, just 1% every hour
SPAC is like some kind of new way to launch IPOs/mergers for cheap. Or maybe it's some kind of code name for Elon's martian base. Either way I'm in.
it's just 2PAC with the S backwards
SPAC=Space=To the moon
I am a retard
I sold 90% of of CIIC.
Same thing, I thought I was here for the lolz, and here I am, buying a stock that I barely know what the company does
Theres a shit load of hype on EV stocks, so just ride the train
That might be a little too much you retard
Wouldnt fill everything AH but I got 40k common. Its go time. https://postimg.cc/HrLn7bmX
You retard, have my upvote!
Then buy HCAC
Cant buy AH?
Welcome aboard
You boarded an econ passenger, you leave a first-class autist.
same lol
Ah fuck. Wish I saw that a moment ago
WTF are warrants?
yes
Yes
I am actually a retard
Also interested in your take on this
Not enough lol buy more
Lol fucking perfect
Essentially before the merger occurs you can redeem your shares for ~$10. This floor goes away after the merger is completed.
Upvote for visibility
Shares are redeemable at the NAV of cash in the SPAC's trust.  Its not always exactly 10, but around that.
Hopefully we have a solid 10% day tomorrow
Wrong ticker. Its THCB
I don't think know what to hat is and I'm probably gunna buy it tomorrow
You don't need weed when THCB has THC in it.
Hell yea
Retard power baby
send it
Do you like the long term prospects of this company? Titanium sounds too good to be true. It charges so fast. If it is so good why doesn't everybody do this? Is there something magical about their thermal patent?
Wrong stock or typo?
Lets see what you find
Is this a stock that can be held on to for long term play? Or is it a pump and dump kind of scenario?
Your last sentence sold me. I'm in.
Theres almost zero downside pre merger. Your shares are quarantined to return 10 dollars a piece should merger fail. Once the merger is complete it can fall below your 10 dollar entry at any time like a real stock however.
500 here!!
Dopeee
How do warrants work?
The volume spiked significantly after this post so probably
Seriously, fuck this boomer buy and hold  shit. Risk it all on the hot meme stock of the week
This one actually has pretty good financials and tech.
Nice job on the ciic.  I got in at 14 and out at 17 :( 


I did the same thing and jumped right in here after
The power of retards lmao 
- a proud retard :)
warrants can go to 0. Stock should never go below 10 (until after merger)
Fuck it bought another 300 warrants
welcome, just be patient on this one
just stay away from the real crack like tesla
Same 250 here and then some warrants haha
Yea, he did. Mentioned it in a reply earlier here
same i might sell some of the warrants though and switch to shares bc i dont really like too much risk
Warrant is basically 11.5C expiring 2026
Can warrants be sold for a profit similar to shares? Sry, this is something new to me.

Debating between warrants and shares right now.
Some brokers dont let you trade warrants. But yes, the ticker is THCBW.
Im personally super retarded and I sold all 40 of my CIiC at $23 to buy 120 of the one hes telling us to buy now
I manged to buy in at 9.0 Does that give me extra Points?
If the merge fails you contact your brokerage to do it
Cant buy orders aswell
youo should sell everything you own and cop warrants
It will be 20+ in a month
You spelled wife wrong
They are calling a vote this week, they would have to sign an extension by early December
Get warrants instead, THCBW.
My lawyer, he had sex with my mamma...why?
thcb = share
w = warrant
U = share + warrant
Sometimes you have to take a test or whatever to enable "complex stocks", that is how it works on degiro anyways
already ran up quite a bit. Lumify and Clarius are better than butterfly IQ too
Apple is fucking lame now.
Get into this ASAP imo. Nio might dip and you can buy back in
They will likely sign an extension on Dec 3
Lucky for me I didnt read this so Ill continue to have confidence following OP
Thanks for the input but who cares lol
We are retards remember
> That is referencing the spac shell company, not the fucking target company.

Mega fucking lol. Yes, we should have been looking at Microvast's financials instead.
/u/ComputerTE1996 
Yeah it's the 7th of December but they will be extending it by December 3rd. Who fucking cares, this retard gave us some DD. Go all in
dude I literally posted the positions
yes
Only in recent weeks tbh
ELI5: What happens if I buy 1 thingy of THCBW?
0
This is literally at the very bottom already, buy warrants
Yes, but if THCB trades above $18 for 30 days after the merger, the warrants can be called. So youd have to sell or redeem at that point.
Theyre likely going to file for an April 2021 extension. Deal should be completed before then, but it can always take longer.
Its only available under the invest account. Not ISA.
use a real broker lol
Its only available under the invest account. Not ISA.
Depends, have you bought yet
yes
I think Fiat Group is. Doing some more reading still
Who gives a fuck. Were in this for the short term tendies. Fuck the future
It's automatic. And it's 10.22 not 10 I just found out, even better.
Yeah rh is retarded
> THCB

RH has not updated this yet.
Means the pigs can kick your door in

I got 3
Trade republic in germany got it
I'm using Degiro and the ticker is available there.

I sold. Check

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzkpv1/i_made_the_dd_on_ciic_last_week_now_i_am_moving/?sort=new
Its basically worth share price IF the merger goes through
rip
I got only shares. 500. No warrants
These retards seem pretty rich so Ill become one too
Look what happened with CIIC. Why would you fight momentum (and thats momentum thats just begun)
You just did business
Ye
CIIC is the SPAC, not the actual company
no
Why? The more people that buy the bigger our company and stocks get. Let's spread the word!
I have no idea what THCA is. Probably the same difference between NIO and NIU.
very likely, nothing is 100%
Fuck yeah. Hop on this train before it leaves the fucking station retards.
It won't fail, they will sign an extension
What are warrants?
No
I don't like canoo
It's a SPAC, they don't need a website really
It is not a weed company lol. Just a SPAC.
RH never updates shit
THCBW
hold, easy
Don't hold INTC lol
A good brokerage with a lot of investment classes
They are going to sign an extension
Warrents are risky, always are. Can be worth zero next year. Shares can always be redeemed at NAV value, usually around $10 (if its the standard SPAC structure). This can be done even if they dont find a target.
tldr?
Upvote for visibility
I'm not sure what the fine details are surrounding these specific warrants, but think of them like calls. Shares are safer, if everything goes to shit they'll still be worth 10 dollars.

I'm pretty fucking retarded so it's possible something I've said is incorrect.
Fuckin English please. Were retards, only words we read are Moon and All in.
I bought 100 shares after reading your comment. With SPACs I didn't realize there's no downside as you can redeem it each share for $10 if it fails. 

Exit target for me is in the $20s. Literally doubling money.
I'm looking into this too. Need some GIK DD!
half half
THCB are shares with $10 floor. TCHBW are essentially LEAPs, no price floor (can lose it all)
price can't drop below $10
go ahead a sit a few plays out champ
Tuscan originally wanted to enter the cannabis industry and so their blank-check company is listed as such on Robinhood.

>Tuscan, led by Chief Executive Officer Stephen A. Vogel and President and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Epstein, raised $276 million in March 2019 and said it would initially focus on finding a target in the cannabis industry, but added that it wouldnt be limited to any particular industry or geographic region.

They changed direction and ~~are in talks~~ signed a letter of intent with Microvast, an electric battery company.
Just buy thcb. 

Thca has nothing to do with this
And if it's not, where are you guys buying this?
it is
>THCB 

 

Tuscan Holdings Ord Shs

$THCB 

?
If you think this is moon, wait til merger gets announced in the next few weeks
Who the fuck cares. Name of the game is short term bounce. You don't have to hold it for years.
That's what they say when I made the CIIC DD post.
Warrants are basically options. THCBW is essentially an 11.5c expiring in 2026 or ~2 months after merger is completed depending on common share price.
Different components, thc will make you high and cdb will cure cancer

THCB, THCBW
no, thcbw is the warrant, idk what thca is, but you want thcb shares
It's just starting to run. Check the chart
How can you dump it if it cant go below 10?
NIO and PLTR are everywhere too, are they pump and dump?
who cares
warrants
Sit this one out.
From what I understand, which is not much, if they mess up the deal or the merge is shit for whatever reason, it will drop bellow 10. Basically the company it is merging with has to justify at least 10 bucks a share otherwise bye bye
A lot of stocks being mentioned here are below 1B, in fact almost all new EV stocks
It is a SPAC
Try reading
This basically has 0 risk (4% MAX loss).

It is at 10.4 right now, the lowest it can go is 10 (you can redeem cash for 10$ each share).

&#x200B;

I got in CIIC at 11 ish, people bashed me cuz "CIIC didnt have options".
Risk on this one is asymmetric though. Some opportunity cost and -4% if bloomberg is wrong, because of the $10 floor.
How do warrants work?
Um to give me a sense of scale of your heroics/autism, how much money do you currently have in the market?
No... youre an autist
A smart retard...or a retarded smart person.
I like your autistic words, magic man. Im in for 200 shares!
How can I make minimum 6 figures from this information? How much I need for initial play?  If I make, I promise to donate some money to choice of your charity. :)
im a balls deep bag holder in  thats what prompted this comment
Did 250 and some warrants for fun
Me too. Risk on this one is asymmetric, $10 is the floor and worst case its -4% as long as you only buy shares.
Jesus Christ cant yall read its a SPAC for EV batteries. FREE MONEY
Its listed wrong its not. Its an SPAC
im in until it doubles
already at 11 bro, we gonna moon
I luv u
In the land of the retard, the one brain cell man is king
Please answer. Would going 80/20 warrants be a bad idea?
Thanks man start a website or something so we can follow!
big mistake lol
Do you think it will drop in the future or stay stagnant?
I think they harness the power of THC and convert it into battery power for EVs, or something, I dunno, I bought 10k worth.
RIDE the TRAIN. I'm so up on NIO, XPEV, FCEL (not chi-com I know) the last 10 days it's unreal. Ride the wave.
Why too much? 9% downside risk and unlimited upside?
you just gave me an erection
When? Now? Or after.
I usually buy 100 too, but felt good so went for 150
just bought 100 myself
Would also like to know
Warrant Buffett? Just buy them
Yes
https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/stock-option-warrant.asp
 An you not purchase the warrants on RH?
Thanks!
What about hcac?
Am retard, if merger doesnt occur it cashes for ~$10 also right?
Wait what? Then why wouldn't you buy every single SPAC that comes out for like $10-$11? You have almost no risk. 

Also, how do you redeem? For example, on Robinhood.
Upvote for being gay
just need more tards to buy
The warrants are THCBW.
Typo
I'll snag 100 and join you guys to go with my shares
It's the dumbest market I've been a part of and I wouldn't trade it for the world.  Too much fun.
Profits are profits. Congrats nonetheless!
500+ warrants club
I was planning on holding CIIC for a while but after it rocketed up today I sold.
Somewhat European style though (can't exercise anytime you like), but usually they have to be exercised in 30 days after some condition is met or they are worth 0.01. Like X days > $18 after merger and you can and have to exercise is very common. You have to check the S1 for each ticker to see what the rules are, search for "redemption" in the document.
How do you buy them?
Warrants are more high risk high rewards. It basically lets you redeem a share at $11.5. I will all in warrant once announcement is confirmed, right now I suggest half shares half warrants.
Do I need to get TCHBW or will THCB perform the same?  
Im not nearly as autistic as Id like to be, *but i can learn*
THCBBW
Nah that's a good move
whats the difference? will one make more money than the other?
Can u explain warrants for the retards here? Are they like similar to options?
0 idea what a warrant (also 0 idea what thcb is but i trust u g)
Fuck my life I'm too retarded for that shit. I won the first test though. I am on Binck
Alrighty, I think I'll go with THCB then! Appreciate you putting in time and thought to help us all out
You convinced me with that instant response homie. Fuck it, I'm in.
where did you see you get $10.22 back instead of $10?
Too late now, were in this deep
Yea I went full retard there.  My bad
If the stock price is 11.50 USD or more you make money. 

Roughly it is like this:  
(Stock price - 11.50) x number of warrents = your profit 

If stock price is less than 11.50 at expiration you lose your investment and you can call yourself a fellow retard.
You holding onto CIIC or you sell them at the price they are at now, hoping they drop again?
WeBull not letting me buy warrants, bought a 100 shares
Got it, thank you my fellow retard. Im in for 500 warrants with the play money
What movements do you typically see to warrant prices of an extension is filed?
Yep I just found it 
I was going to try CFD....
Such as? I'm trying here...

TIA
Only allowed me to use 1k up front so thats all I got, is there a way to get the rest?
So if I buy $20k worth shares today and lets say tomorrow before a merger it hits $5 and I sell them back at $5 how will the broker adjust this or what happens? I have RH btw. Any input will help, thank you
Thanks buddy. You should start like a youtube channel or newsletter or something.
Makes sense thanks
Decided to use degiro because I already had an account there. Waiting for them to process my bank account which may take 1-3 days. Hope it's not too late by then xD Thanks for the help!
You think ciic still has any room to go though? I'm still holding some stocks. I see it's up 2 dollars postmarket atm. Might get in on the new play too though.
Based on the hype from Cramer I still think there may be some rise tomorrow. Thoughts or should I just cash out my 40% increase from CIIC and go to THCB?
Follow up question. Why the 30/70 split to shares/warrants. Im thinking of just doing the shares
fuck it im in
THCA is the molecule in weed before it becomes decarboxylated via adding heat. Then it just becomes THC.
i bought 1 share of CIIC. Now I just bought 100 shares of THCB.
Let's wake up to 25% up pre market tomorrow
Damnit well im in warrants anywAys highest risk i could find
Guess thats cos of the skateboard? Or the management? 

I find their subscription platform to be a fun gimmick but yet cant really see it working long term with the masses.
Does a merger almost guarantee a big pop? Im basically scared of it merging and then it drops below $10
hey guy, thanks for last weeks dd, helped me a lot. Are you holding CIIC long term? or have you rolled most of your position into this like i have? is it too late to buy back into CIIC?
Theyre on a downturn I thought it was an opportune time to pickem up
[deleted]
Whats the process of redeeming? Lets say I buy $20k worth of shares at $10.65 a share and lets just say for some reason tomorrow it hits $5 how would I go about getting the $10 if selling through my broker will give me less than half my investment since thats what it is worth?
i read around and got it

thanks brotha
I'm also in as of this morning. I think we will see a pop in the next few days (or next week at the latest)
Whats the process of redeeming? Lets say I buy $20k worth of shares at $10.65 a share and lets just say for some reason tomorrow it hits $5 how would I go about getting the $10 if selling through my broker will give me less than half my investment since thats what it is worth?
Fuck me. The actual stock itself cannot go under $10? My cunt self doesn't understand because it seems too retarded to be true.
Lol shit sorry I'm new. Can you explain?
Awesome info. Im all in. Thank you
rip ok i get it now. thcw is the warrants ticker and its basically an options call that lets me buy thcb at like 11 bucks right. i can still sell thcw like i would an option without excersizing for profit right if it goes up
Huh?
Im still confused as to whether or not it is the THCB on RobinHood though? RobinHood says its a weed stock but OP says it isnt!?!?
Cannot see the warrant but theres volume on the Tuscan holdings true
Yeah you're right.
Well downside risk is now 10% but whatever, that's what you get for being late to the hype train. But these guys can't just magically offer more shares or smth so the price drops if we pump it too high here in advance right?
They are shilling the warrants.
Irrelevant. THCB is a garbage SPAC with questionable Chinese management.
But I understood that should the deal flop, you get paid out a base $10 per share? So the only exposure you have is the price you pay about $10
All of which are P&Ds, clearly shown by the price action right after your post.
Yeah I'm liking SPAC plays so far.  I'm getting in at maybe a 5% risk worse case scenario, but I'm seeing 25-50% pops pretty easily

I'm just buying shares
Could you explain how you redeem for 10$ each share ?
[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-largest-microsoft-365-data-120000230.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-largest-microsoft-365-data-120000230.html)

&#x200B;

APXT is in a similar situation right now. Close to NAV, just announced today, ancilliary cloud space though. I also pivoted out of CIIC and SBE, valuations were getting very out of hand.
If you think SPACs are 0 risk you're wrong. They are redeemable cash for $10 a share BEFORE merger. If the merger goes through and the market doesn't like the result they can still tank and you can still lose your ass.
Technically less risk than that because if I SPAC doesn't close they return the $10 / share plus accumulated cash interest per share.
Wait how can you redeem if it goes to 10?
In for 20k warrants just now. I like this one.
Where are you buying these? I cant find it on my app
How would we redeem if it fell below ten?
How do u redeem for $10 if fails?
so are you 30% shares 70% warrants or 30% warrants 70% shares? and whats the difference?
Fuck if I know
Warrants as that provides leverage. Each warrant allows you to get a share for $11.50. So basically see it as an option to buy one share at $11.50 strike with a five year expiry. Warrants sell for $1.59 right now TCHB-W. So to essentially control the risks and rewards of 10,000 shares you can get that for say $16,000 ish. This isnt a perfect analogy as warrants start to get throttled a bit at $18 or so usually as the company can force redemption. But close enough. This of course isnt investment advice and do your own research. This is high risk.
This is the main point here. If you can handle a potential -4% in exchange for 200% opportunity, then do this.
How do you figure that?
So the stock can't go lower than $10 ? How's that possible?
Now kith
no, just cause an autist gets something right once does not mean he's bound to make good picks forever. that being said i'm in for 180 shares
Hard to tell with this EV craze, I already made over 150% on CIIC. I am moving on to THCB, way more rooms to run.
Too poor to give you an award, but you deserve one 
Well if the market doesn't like the merger it can also tank the stock post merger. Also howtf did you get 500k and not realize the importance of diversification lol. At least spread it out among other EVs and memes if you must, TSLA, PLTR, XPEV, LI, CIIC, MOON, ICLN, QCLN, etc don't put all your eggs in one basket
Holding for $18+ hopefully!
If this doubles Ill send you a $100 gift card of your choice. Root for me!
ASAP
Don't like Canoo as much, I'm sure it will run up a bit tho
Yep. Warrants become worthless.
yes, that is likely

the warrents can go to zero though
You cant trade warrants on Robinhood. And youre correct, buying near ~10 SPACs is very low risk.
Sign me the fuck up then!
Welcome aboard 
Get a real broker
I don't think you can on rh.  I believe 2 years ago people were buying warrants and didn't know they could end up losing the entire investment
i dont understand warrants. if it's 1.50 right now and THCB is 10.50. I don't understand how much leverage it is getting. i know you're working hard to shill THCB but im' hoping you can help a brother out. 

on schwab, there's no details on the warrant like options have strike or expiration. so how are you doing the math for warrants?

TLDR: where do i find exercise price and ratio?
Thanks! Bought 70/30 shares/warrants, hoping for the best.
The downside risk of buying warrants is limited to the premium you pay up front yes?
Warrants are higher risk higher return.
Thanks b
Warrants have different terms depending on the SPAC. The most common term is 1 warrant for 1 share. Buying a THCB warrant gives you the right to buy 1 share of THCB for $11.50 (strike price) around 1 month after the merger is completed. 

If THCB trades above $18 for 30 days after the merger, the warrants can be called. If they are called you must sell the warrants or pay the strike prices.
The warrants will go up as the stock goes up. So kinda similar to options,  but not really. Purchasing a warrant gives you the right to purchase one share at a fixed price of $11.50. This is from the THCB filing: 

 Each warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination and 12 months from the date of this prospectus. The warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption.
Dont listen to me though because Im dumb as fuck who just happens to also have said fuck it, Im in and bought 200 shares
Awesome. Follow up: I see $11.50 in the SEC filings. However when I placed the order, it shows up as this: "TUSCAN HOLDINGS C 26 WTSWARRANTS EXP 04/01/26"

What is the 26? I thought the strike price was $11.50?
He sold 90 percent of his position of CIIC, now it is not speculative anymore, if you believe the company you stay for the long haul otherwise you move on
An April extension should be bullish because it means they are on track to close the deal. The real thing to look for is a Definitive Agreement. Warrants should move above $2 once a DA is released.
Apply for free trial of gold on RH. Cancel after getting funds.
market is retarded, it could run higher but I don't like the valuation now. THCB is safer
Cramer read my DD, he is late
Sure fucking looking like it baby
the announcement of the merger will cause a big pop
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzkpv1/i_made_the_dd_on_ciic_last_week_now_i_am_moving/
Downturn... more like being phased out
You get $10 cash per share if it fails. Unlikely to fail too.
Gone? We get the cash back no?
THCB are the shares. THCBW are the options, not available on RH bc it's not a real broker. microvast is private, no ticker, is merging with THCB, so buy those shares. but you shouldn't rush to invest at all if you don't understand what is happening ("sit a few plays out")
if your on RH, just buy THCB. microvast is private also i think
thcbw you retard
This is the company op is referring to
THCB is an SPAC. Its a company meant to be a merger. Originally it was meant to merge with a weed stock but it changed directions as it announced its merger with Microvast
I dont use rh cant say sorry
if there is no merge, yes, you get the money back. If the merge happens and it is shit and people starting selling their stock and it goes bellow 10, you have no protection.

Basically you have protection only before the merge happens, after thar you are on your own. And a merge is not guarantee of stonks, it has to be a good merge.
Solo, ayro, sbe, just to name a few off the top of my head.

Even GME is under 1B
These SPACs feel like I'm exploiting some kind of loophole that hasn't been discovered yet. How is it this easy to make money with so little risk?
If merger fails, they just return $10 for each share you have
Their CEO is named Jeffrey Epstein lol
I bought a 100 shares of this an hour ago.  Valuation at $2b.
After merger meaning down the road once the new company IPOs or immediately after the vote for merger is finalized?
Whats the process of redeeming? Lets say I buy $20k worth of shares at $10.65 a share and lets just say for some reason tomorrow it hits $5 how would I go about getting the $10 if selling through my broker will give me less than half my investment since thats what it is worth?
You could just set a stop loss tho??
Any decent broker should have THCB
basically the warrants will move 2x the stock
profit of 10k is 20k for warrant
You just discovered one of the main interesting features of a SPAC

Before merger, you can redeem your shares for the NAV price (~$10) at a specific day. So it will never be much lower than that, otherwise its arbitrage to just buy, wait and redeem at $10 at a later date. After merger the floor is gone though.
that being said im in with my student loan
>just cause an autist gets something right once

You only need to win once if you bet it all.
What do you reckon I should do with my 550 SBE shares? Currently up +85%
I would never hold this post merger. In for a quick 20-40% pop and Im out. This could easily go to $17+
Im rooting real HARD baby.
Ill snag some tomorrow. Really liking this SPAC plays
Im with OP I passed on Canoo. Even listened to their call today and was unimpressed.
Id argue its more likely than not that THCB completes the business combination with Microvast.
What is the likelihood of that happening in this case you think?
>You cant trade warrants on Robinhood

Um... so that means if I bought my THCB shares from Robinhood I cannot get my $10 back? :sad face: 

Sorry for the dumb questions.
How do you obtain warrants?
Where are you guys buying the warrants?  RH?
I got Fidelity homie.
> didn't know they could end up losing the entire investment

How's that different from options? Aren't warrants basically like long term options except they are issued by the company themselves?
Bump for visibility. I have Schwab as well and am retarded
All SPAC warrants have a $11.50 strike price
Yeah warrants can be total loss. Shares can't go under 10.
Where does the $11.50 strike price come from? 

And why must thcb be trading above $18 for 30 days? Is that the only way outcome where one makes a profit?
This this is the way. That's what I did with his ciic dd. My only regret is i didn't liquidate my entire portfolio and dump it into ciic to make an easy 90%
Right, thanks for posting these.
Alright. Cashing out right before close and going into THCB!
only for shares, warrants go to 0 if there's no extension of merger deadline
Thanks for explaining. And no I will not sit out. I will go full retard and put everything I own on it
yeah
Ah yea, of course, since then its practically shares of the merged company and not the SPAC. Question is, how likely is it to drop below $10.
I think this guy is a retard but SBE is over $1B now
Mentioning other rule breakers doesn't help your case, kinda makes it worse tbh
Because everything is simple when youre retarded
SPACs are fast to public trading and the market is insane right now.
Automatically? I dont have to request to trigger anything?
How long does the return typically take?

Sure Google is my friend but you're smarter than Google
***if merger fails***

keep in mind if a merger goes through that is not a good one the stock can still tank and you can still lose your $10/share
Why not go hard then? There must be a certain level of risk associated with this.
Can the warrants be redeemed for anything?
The one thing worth noting is that if the merger DOES go through and there's no buyer momentum, the $10 floor drops out w/no guarantee it gets back there (e.g. HOFV, FREE, and a whole bunch of other SPACs). That being said, this is and ESG so it's probably going to do better
He goes by Jeff
Yeah to me it doesn't seem unreasonable with the existing revenue and CAGR they have. It's not pre-revenue like others. I bought about 2500 shares haha, rotated out of CIIC and SBE as they have much less room to run, and put options are asymmetrically pricing in a significant drop similar to other SPACs whose valuations got really out of hand.
Id personally just set a stop limit at 10.20 and 10
Guess I gotta find a better one. Anyone got good suggestions
Thanks for that, I'm new to SPACs. So after merger it could go below? But before that I'm safe? Do they tend to crash after merger usually?
I'm guessing Robinhood doesn't let you do this ?
everytime someone mentions student loans I think back to the painful time I paid back a student loan cause I thought I wouldn't need it
Generally you'd be right, but in this case OPs last winning play was only a 1 bagger
sell
Godspeed then lol
I'd argue that commons makes more sense here, since the risk is asymmetric ($10 floor). You can even buy it safely on margin and get 2x leverage if you want.
No, I believe you can still get the $10 back. Warrants are a separate entity.
Add a w to the ticker when searching for it
Apparently you cant find it on robinhood, I use E*TRADE and Schwab, can be found on those platforms
THCW is ticker, Robinhood doesn't allow warrants is why I said that
So basically safer than options lol
1:1, strike 11.5
Why cant they go under $10?
Warrant terms are decided by the SPAC. If the warrants arent called, they expire 5 years after the merger. They can still be redeemed, normally around 1 month after the merger.
Lol itd be insane to go all in because of a reddit post. But yeah it wouldve been really nice in hindsight. 

Hoping for a big pop with THCB.
Screenshot of positions.
It is a risky play, we barely know which company it will merge to, let alone if the merge will be good. Usually you are betting on the board of the spac, in this case is Yolo and I don't even know who they are but got my stocks
Yeah but it wasn't
Not automatic. You would have to ask. Process varies. Not an expert but I know it's not automatic from reading previous threads in another sub.
*Let me add, it depends if there is a deal going through, you get a choice to redeem at trust value(and you would only redeem if it's a shitty deal) If there's no deal then it may be more of an automatic process because the spac would cease to exist. In this spac's case, they were supposed to finish by December 7 or cease to exist. They have a meeting to extend that deadline to April 2021. You can read about it here https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/thcb/secfilings?subview=secarticle&guid=14502597&type=313
This is entirely true, but doesn't make for retarded fun.
This is not even true, lmao. You always have a period of time after announcements to redeem your shares for the redemption value.

edit: I don't think my post was clear, if they announce a target you don't like/they drop from the announcement, you can still redeem your shares for NAV. However once the merger is complete you can no longer do this, but you typically have months to do this...
you can sell it before the vote or exchange for $10 before the merger
SPACs have 2 years to find a target so in some cases you are potentially parking money for a while. Opportunity cost, etc. In this case if they announce in a couple weeks you are good. Or you might buy in above NAV and they pick a shitty target and lose value like when CCIV rumor was DirectTv
no they're worthless if no merger.
500 warrants gets you an etch-a-sketch
Jeff Epshtein
Yeah I added 900 more after looking more into it.

Seems legit.
TD
Dude I'm old as fuck and I envy you so much. You can literally throw money into anything in the stock market and like 20 years from now you'll be a millionaire. 

Just don't get into debt to buy stocks.
https://postimg.cc/HrLn7bmX 
I mean I can buy right now and my max downside is 9.5%. Not many stocks offer you that. I'm interested that is for sure.
I agree. I have 60% warrants 40% commons.
Ah got it. I enjoyed your Ted talk. Thank you.
When I purchase a warrant, what is the price that I agree to purchase a share for if I exercise the warrant? And when does the warrant expire?
It can be found on TD too
As a SPAC, they were sold at $10 a share and if everything goes south will be redeemed to the current owner at $10 a share. It's just how it works
https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/07/06/special-purpose-acquisition-companies-an-introduction/
Thanks that made some sense. Not fully understood but I just bought 200 warrants. 

So if THCB pops off and hits $18 does that mean ill collect the difference between the stock price and strike price of the warrant?
Yeah. I put 30 percent more into this than I did ciic. Hoping this one does a quick $30 pop and I'm out. Gonna use the gains to become thetagang and collect premium
True
What happens if there is a merger?
Thank you
I don't have the patience for that (yet). Maybe once I start hitting losses in my account I'll pull out but so far so good. Only "invested" what I could lose and still live Ok for 6mo (w/ college) w/o a job (ik I'm not a TRUE autist but the main reason is I don't want to disappoint mom by going bankrupt at 19)
LMAO my man make it a new thread on this post so that others can see it as well
Apparently its a 11.5C (dont know where OP got that strike) with 04/01/2026 expiration. Found the expiration on the stock description after I placed the trade
Thanks for not calling me retarded.  How does that work with Robinhood?   Does it just get credited to my account?
Intrinsic value of a warrant with an 11.5 strike price is (Stock Price - 11.50). Before the warrants are able to be redeemed, they normally trail intrinsic value by a bit.
Im probably expecting $20 a share and then Ill get out. I gotta learn theta because Im still dumb as fuck but just want to make money
Well before the merger you get the option to redeem your shares for 10.xx if you don't like the target. So after the merger that 10.xx floor is gone, and it might drop below $10, or like NKLA it rockets up to $90 haha.
FWIW, this company looks like it's not going to go bankrupt. [They have a lot of clients](http://www.microvast.com/index.php/solution/solution_pr). And the titanium type of battery is the only kind that can be charged so fast. 

My only concern after looking through this company's website is that not much has been happening last couple of months. But maybe it's because they were preparing for this event.
e stocks still pumping?? Literally all my options positions are blasting even further the last 30 min. PLTR, NIO, XPEV

Excuse me while I puke over selling my PLTR calls on Friday
To make this pump and dump process to run at 100%, we need to split the WSB sub into WSB US Edition and WSB Asia/Europe Edition. So when we go to sleep, retards in the Asia/Europe pump up the stocks that weve been pumping hard during the day while we sleep, and when they go to sleep, we take the torch and continue to pump the stocks while they sleep. Repeat and rinse

That said, this pump is insanely scary. Gotta ride this mf while it lasts though.
Weed stonks ripping. They're all garbage, but I'm warning you now, it's time to hop on early before these go on a stupid run prior to the MORE Act vote and Biden administration.

I made money today and I'm pissed  wtf is happening to me...
For the first time since knowing to care, I'm in pretty deep. I feel like I yolo'd. I took profits and sold 90% of my shares, deposited more money and reallocated like 40% of my portfolio. Now I'm 90%+ options. 15%+ of my portfolio expires Friday. 

I'm either going to puke, or, well wont feel at ease until I sell tomorrow. It wasn't an all in no DD yolo but if something bad happens (thank god he didnt chose warren), I'll be fucked and back where I was early Sept. Pray for me. I didnt tell my SO, couldn't even admit and confess it to friends who trade.

Smoking a joint in honor of APHA after hours
It hurts knowing I coulda made life changing money if I sold my stocks and YOLOed into EV options lately.
Anyone else getting the vibe that these EV stocks are running up like all the weed stocks did a couple years ago? When the rest of retail buys into these stocks, get the fuck out.

I think we take our brilliant markets for granted. Imagine being British and trading on the FTSE
LGVW EXPLODINGGGG
Who misses the days when we were making donations of charities because tendies were flowing hand over fist?
So i made 150% in an all in on XOM FD which no one believed in.

Then i put half of it on the AAPL dip. Why the fuck couldnt there be a dip on anything else
Imagine being an MM holding like 4 billion in AAPL or something and these 3d design companies keep gapping up 25% daily

Averaging down on my puts that expire this week was clearly not a great idea

BABA stocks need to be higher.
Cheers to the dude that had 900k in CRSR and convinced me to buy $25k in shares last week
Still cant wait for the AirBnB ipo

I have this feeling that there is an agreement by both sides not to panic people about how bad the economy really is right now, and that one side is going to break that agreement and scream about how bad things are on January 20th.
Softbank is back
Ever plan to buy something when price drops down to a certain price but when it finally gets there, you get scared? 

That's how I feel about gold right now.

1. The [price of cheese plummeted this week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/cheese-prices-plunge-as-lockdowns-bite-into-dining-business?srnd=premium).
2. DPZ crushed sales expectations last earnings report, but the stock sank [because of increased operating costs.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/08/dominos-pizza-dpz-q3-2020-earnings.html)
3. What accounted for most of the cost increase? The high price of cheese. 

Calls on Pizza?
Whos buying tesla calls tomorrow
So /u/ComputerTE1996 is our THCB gang leader?
Apha calls, thcb stocks and warrants and hcac warrants got me so pumped for tomorrow. Please don't fail me.

Realistically, how many days of 10-100% gains before we get handed the rug pull?
Is swing trading Spacs the new way forward?
Hear me out

PTON... but electric bikes. HOLY FUCK that shit would rip 600% in 2 weeks
If you missed on RIOT, check out MARA. Gonna reach 20 soon.
All in TESLA tomorrow, biggeest of EVs will pop
Is it legal to make money this easily?
Planned on buying PLTR this morning. Wife and son are visiting her mom so I slept in and forgot, fuck me.
please remember this comment when ICLN hits $300 in 2023
THCB to the moon 
Good day today bulls!! I imagine most of us made gains thnx to PLTR and TSLA. For once, I caught THCB early enough as well thanks to that kind retard. Now let's see what happens next
Got THCBW without even reading about them. Hope i didnt fuck up
THCB gonna MOOOOOOON
Get on THCB now or forever get fucked.
My dad bought 3000 shares of THCB today. This boomer was Ford all the way. Please show him the way to tendie land
Money is everywhere with these meme stocks. In all serious though guys dont get too wrapped up with them. Remember to take profits and play with house money. Who knows maybe its a bubble maybe its not. Glad everyone is making some dough!
PLTR is slated to become it's own country
Just take a second and look at the sentiment around here. Everyone is being nice, even the losers are just mildly salty.  Why why why would you ever want to be a bear and hope shit goes down?  Those are like the kids who volunteered to be hall monitors back in the day
THCB 
Up 34.43% for the day - thanks BLNK / CRSR

Rug pull tomorrow for sure, WSB isnt allowed to be profitable
PLTR, thanks! another day or two like this please!
So EVs are gonna be priced in for the next 20 years?
Today was fucking AmaZing!!
XPEV is fucking nuts holy
THCB to $15+ get innnnnn
This place is now Pump and Dump HQ with the Chinese Division and SPAC Division.
THCB is 11.25 after hours???? holy moly.
I have a bunch of lists on Robinhood and the two that are always mooning are the Meme and China ones
How certain are we that THCB is the one merging with the battery maker?
Cramer called out our meme stocks, hes all for it...I guess the partys ending soon
Missing out on this FCEL rally will go down as one of the biggest regrets in my life. When I'm on my deathbed I won't be thinking about that girl I didn't ask out, that experience I didn't do when I had the chance, not getting divorced sooner, I'll be thinking about not getting FCEL when I was watching it at $2
THCB baby
What's the point of having a job if I can just own pltr stock
Holy shit everything related to EVs is fucking
#GREEEEN
If y'all playing meme stonks long, I sure hope you have some retard OTM puts lol

Gonna have a Sept 4th extinction here when NIO/XPEV/BLNK have a -30% day
I THOUGHT U FUCKS SAID THE MARKET PRICED IN BIDEN WIN LONG AGO. LMAO NONE OF YALL KNOW WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT. SMH. ITs pRiCeD iN
For everyone saying NIO/XPEV/LI are overvalued...  TSLA is more than 3x their combined value.... 

China is banning traditional vehicles and backing these companies.  They are heavily incentivizing purchasing EVs and id assume they would rather have Chinese companies make bank than TSLA, wouldnt you?

Not really seeing the bubble case here. There will be shit tons of EV sales in the next decade and barring an engineering disaster or major financial scandal, these companies are going to be right there with TSLA.
Mango Concedes. Buy-Them Chinese EV Stocks 

retards on WSB keep writing "gamma squeeze" as if they have any fucking clue what they're talking about
Aight, All-Time-Still-Red Gang on me:

If you find it difficult to stomach some of these yuge gains our brothers are making, remember it's not a race, and you will never meet any of these people IRL and their wealth doesn't affect you in the slightest.

Don't FOMO into something stupid unless it feels good. 
There's enough digital money to go around 
i gues we /r/penystocks now lol
Can we please all focus on 1 stock and talk about it? 

Palantir pumped 17% today because WSB focused on this stock and on this stock only lately.

We need to do the same. 

Please organize and start talking about one decent stock with good posts and DDs. Others will follow. This way we can all get rich.

Please spread this idea as much as possible. I'm going to sleep.
ARK buying LGVW. Hell. Yes. Glad I got my shares today.
Why spend 4 years in college when you can get a degree in 3 weeks from WSB?
Who's buying RIOT tmr?
GUYS I Have a WEIRD problem..my options keep going ITM. What do?

#SAMEDAYLOSSPORN
I lost money today. Im certified retarded
Sigh sold PLTR too early, but I jumped on to CRSR. Paper hands always gets me
So I guess the rug-pull is scheduled for tomorrow then right?
XPEV after hours party dont turn down the music
all shorts and bears destroyed today... what a day, chinese EV's fukin killing it.. to good to be true
Y'all got tesla calls yet?? Or going with the poor man's/bootleg LI, NIO, XPEV etc??
Nasdaq needs to get its shit together tmr 
XPEV is being manipulated to discredit Elons comments.
I just with I could instantly buy every dip and sell every top as many times as I wanted through out the day.
XPEV can hit $100 EOW... think about that for a second.
CIIC still memin?
Diamond handing 11/27 NIO, TSLA, and PLTR calls. Hopefully having a thankful thanksgiving.
Always buy the MSFT dip.
My target price for BABA is 300. I really hope my 1/15 calls hit,I would bust a thousand nuts
Yellen in the house bois
tomorrow is the day for XPEV puts aint no way in hell this keeps going
Peter Thier basically bailed me out of my failed HLYN yolo in September lol
I've officially had 3 different gfs call me autistic. None of which were referencing this sub. 
I never thought communism would pay me this well
jeesus every SPAC related to EVs/batteries are going up AH.
I bought PLTR 21c 11/27s then got busy at work and didnt sell.

Am I fuk?
How can Roblox not fucking moon with all the hype surrounding it? Literally every kid who touches it gets so addicted. 

Needless to say I'm going in FAT, and when I do I'll buy my lambo with Robux.
Feel like Im the only one who bought PLTR puts today. Definitely retarded
This sub is having a surge in garbage tickers with no options available
PLUG
I'm not cool with all this citron slander... it's not okay to insult the mentally challenged 
Very strange how any mention of THCB on this sub last week got you downvoted into oblivion, but suddenly its being pumped until no end today. Flavor of the week I guess. The warrants Had a similar run last week before cooling off a bit. Looking to get back in warrants around $1.30 (sold today at $1.50)
What is THCB
No news? BLNK just popping for fun
lol blnk and ciic 10% ah... hahah
RIde the fucking EV train bois!
Bought 100 PLTR 21.5c 11/27 this morning at 0.55, sold at 0.55, dont be like me, dont have paper hands
OK BLNK is getting stupid I obviously love riding this wave (+31% for me today) but why are people still buying?
ANDREW LEFT, OPEN UP  YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR CRIMES AGAINST WSBYOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT BUT ANYTHING YOU WRITE ON YOUR SHITTY CITRON BLOG MAY BE USED AGAINST YOU IN COURT 
Forget the moon suckers, were blasting to the Sun. Ill see youll there.
Tomorrow I'm buying BLNK 25p because management would be retarded not to do an offering soon. This is a billion dollar company with less than a million in revenue last quarter. The had 2.5 million in *revenue* in 2019. They also have to increase that float before things blow up in their faces for good.

Just offering 5 million shares at 25 would improve their cash position 15 fold.

/Retarded valuation is another reason but I'm looking for more viable, technical reasons in this enviroment.
Apple and Amazon teamed up to fuck me over today. My two largest positions :/
I feel like XPEV has to fall back tomorrow, but I sure hope it doesn't
God dammit another Tesla roof came flying off
You know what's better than making $2200? Making it tax free in a Roth
Aight anytime now apple
I literally have no idea why i bought 1/15 Apple calls and 11/27 Spy puts today... Im fukd
BLNK was $12 a week ago. Nutty
FCEL ADDED TO SP500 
Its easy to be nice when youre rich. I dont know where I heard that but its so true
  
Edit: its from the movie parasite
I am so far up my ass in calls right now
Who is swing trading FTEK and FCEL with me????
Loading up on FCEL up until earnings lets go
XPENG.... da fuq??
THCB AH hours action is crazy
I dumped a ton into FCEL but then fell asleep.

Best mistake ever.
Can you imagine how much more the Nasdaq would have been down if it werent for TSLA masking the bloodbath in FAANG today?!
Lmao CIIC I love you I dont even know what you do besides print me money
God i made so much money Amazon today /s
Where do you guys think PLTR opens tomorrow?
Do I care why KNDI is up over 8.5% AH? No. Do I care to know? No. 
Will it print? Absolutely
This is a New paradigm. Stonks only go up
holy shit SBE relentless after hours
ZM CALLS GAYBOYZZZZZZ
Zoologists are worried that Bears may get extinct!
When was the last red day you guys saw? I think mine was Monday before the election.
Slammed at my real job, and got family coming into town. I just went all in EOD on 12/18 and 12/24 PLTR calls. Ain't got time to watch it all week.
What do we have to look forward to then boys? roblox? airbnb? What else
I swear to god I bought MSFT like 4 months ago for 208 and thought it was a no brainer. 
P/L 2$
Today didn't suck!!
Feels like there will be big actions on China trade and Iran between now and Jan 20th
My move is to hopefully not regret holding my PLTR and COTY calls overnight
DIX so small
Im going for MARA , seems like its still going up tomorrow
I sold all my shares of AAPL.

I was dead money.

Now its time to go deeper in EV 
Lmfaooooo I made more money today buying FCEL stock at 4pm than I did playing options for 4 weeks god damn options are awful
Where my $360c holders at
What sector is left to moon after evs?
Imagine holding AAPL anything though?
THCB I have no clue what it does but I bought from that post earlier and its mooning
Fcel is on fire
Fuck you cramer lets see your AT, dont tell us how to play Robinhood
Whats the hype around THCB
THCB, BLNK, SBE,  CIIC, SOLO

...

Which one should I put all my money in
I usually avoid meme stocks but Ill occasionally jump in when WSBs on a streak. Last time i jumped in was ALLY after SPCE. Maybe THCB is my next victim.
I really dumped my $5 FCEL calls for a 100% gain last week when it hit $6. My hands are literally toilet paper
ENG
PYPL
NIO
BABA !!! 
Lets go bulls! We eating!
Will GME hit 20? Still time to hop on that train?
I think I'm shedding some of my meme stock holdings tomorrow and doubling down on best buy, apple, and alibaba
All this green is going to make my Cyber Monday/Black Friday buying rampage the best Ive ever had. Thank god for covid
Current state of meme investing: EVs (NIO, TSLA, NKLA), SPACs (CIIC, THCB)

Edit: forgot to add PLTR. It is its own category.
What in the holy mother of pumps is happening
Tsla futures are welcoming new president elect biden, also known as Mr.clean

Bears r so fukd

JPow has until 2022, this man is hellbent on getting SPY to +100% by the time hes out
COME ON APPLE PUMPPPPPP
Selling them AAPL covered calls for the past few months got me buying a new jelqing device
A lot of you here probably wont survive the eventual bubble popping. But for now, we ride to the moon and we laugh at all the gay bears.
Trump just announced he's going to start working with the Biden transition team. Tomorrow = 
Fcell is up 50% today, is this natural growth? Can I still buy calls on this tomorrow and expect to make money?
So wait... how is Trump conceding **news**?

Was the market pricing in a significant likelihood of Biden not being the next president?
 CIIC   

Up 10% AH!
100% loading up on spy puts. Ive seen 360 before and it wasnt the Xbox
bought so many spy calls expiring Friday during the dip today I might be 10x tomorrow lmao fuck
Wait so the explosion in ev stonks was because trump insiders knew he was conceding?
Why is AAPL mooning AH?
It's crazy how POTUS tweets out something like "okay, im going to stop fucking around" and the market booms lmfao

im going to miss this volatlity with POTUS-elect )=
tomorrow better so fucking green that we create a new shade of green i swear
Buyden pump
How much boomer cash is still sitting on the sidelines?

Now that presidency's uncertainty is fading away BABA should be printing till christmas
[deleted]
After September lil crash, I left the market and got in exactly 10 days ago. Thank you PLTR, CIIC, and SNOW. Loaded up on THCB and THCBW for tomorrow.

ACB up +17.43% instantly after Mango's tweet. HOLY SHIT!!

EDIT: +21% NOW
Last time I saw AMZN move like this after-hours, it ran up almost $100 the next day.  Congrats to those holding 3200c
[deleted]
Puts are dumb unless theyre really long dated or used as a day trade. Holding puts overnight expiring in less than a month is retarded. Who do you think you are? Bear God Burrrrrrry?
JoeyB taking us to dow 30,000
Missed an extra 4k in profit today because I was a bitch, can never keep my emotion out of shit no matter how hard I try....
Looks like weed is back on the menu boys
not going to lie. 2 weeks of pump is making me a bit uneasy.
And to think I have 25k wrapped up in RKT. fuck me
My move tomorrow is to go buy a shotgun after selling my PLTR 20$ weeklies for a 30% gain
APHA!!!!!! 

FUCK YES. if it goes to 20 CAD by the end of the year (it wont lol) Ill buy some random fucker off here a PS5.
remember VALE gang from battery day? Im not completely retarded so I bought long expiring calls and am up 700%. VALE gang
Yall ever peeing and then you get this weird tingle thing where you gotta shake your head?
RH needs to process my TCHB yolo already!! I'm not tryna miss blast off!
I wouldnt be surprised if its hulking green at open and then immediately dumps like it did in August.
I am fully loaded in BABA calls today!!!
Hey Siri alert me when thcb has options
So are Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen gonna fuck or what?

What are we buying at open tards
I'm feeling sick knowing I missed this ev run because I was too afraid to fomo
OHH FUCK YELLEN IS BACK
BRQS THCB PLUG to the moooooooooon 
Vix going to 0
So do SPAC stocks just turn into the companies common stock after merger?
Kinda stoked, I'm no big dick trader like most you autists, but looks like I'll meet my personal goal of getting my brother-in-law a PS5 for Xmas with tendies I made.
ya'll got any more EV plays? I need more exposure. I already have FCEL TSLA XPEV LI NIO and BLNK
We have a SPAC and EV bubble going at the same time lol.
So I guess people pumping ENG came up on top? Up 60% after hours
Going to LOAD THCB and then I'm going to sit back and relax and watch my account explode
There we go LGVW
Imagine all the Money sitting on the sidelines waiting for the tech bubble to pop over the last few years.  Imagine all the money getting pulled out in March and Feb due to Covid that is still sitting on the sidelines because of recovery uncertainty,  Imagine all the money that was waiting for election uncertainty to cool down and a clear winner was announced.  Imagine how much money you are going to make December 2020 $$$$$$$
Im new to this sub but I bought $500 PLTR at 18$ cause you retards told me to. What do I do now?
Trump admin news == bullish for BABA
Sector rotation into that reefer 
Trump has bend the knee and says he will cooperate with biden to transfer power.
Even the immovable BABA is moving AH. Hopium springs eternal
You gellin'?  I'm gellin' like Yellin.
US transition starting. Are we going to mars this week?
I cant believe our new saviour is a 
Its days like today that make wallstreetbets great. Love it when we all win together.
Lmfaooo bears are so fucked I love it
Sold CIIC on the opening spike today 
NIO and XPEV making me tweak, need to buy more tmr morning
Been loading up on Telos Corp $TLS. 1B market cap and just IPOd last week. Massive growth potential.
In shambles again, and missed all the massive run ups. Unreal
After Elon mentioned XPEV I wanted to buy calls today when it dipped from 61 to 57.....

IBKR said I had used 3 day trades within 5 business days and therefore I could not even open a new position. New broker so I didn't know.

XPEV 75 now.

This is always my life with this gambling game. At least I still made 15% on my whole portfolio.
If there was a ticker named DEEZ id buy the fuck out of it
This feels very June'ey.. we saw the same bullshit in June with literally 100's of shitty tickers up triple digit percentages for days at a fucking time.. so ridiculous. Everytime i think i've seen it all, the market finds new ways to amaze me.
Fuck it. Bought 5k shares of LGVW .
FOMO'd back into PLTR today after taking nice profits,  I picked up a PLTR 1/15/21 $20c for 3.21 this morning and then sold a PLTR $25c for 2.20 an hour later and used the premium to pick up 15 shares at 19.99. Feeling like I should have just thrown the premiums from my january debit spread into a weekly call tho
Avril Haines tapped as Biden's top intel Chief. She is a former consultant for PLTR. Interesting turn for those thinking Democratic Pres would be a negative. Looks to be a positive at the moment.

[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-picks-avril-haines-director-national-intelligence-n1248626](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-picks-avril-haines-director-national-intelligence-n1248626)
Sold $22 PLTR and $57 NIO covered calls. DID NOT EXPECT THEM TO GET HIT ON FUCKING MONDAY. Probably going to sell my AYRO calls to buy the CCs back for a loss and let me LEAPs runnn.
I keep saying SBE has more room to run, got to keep the cars charged
CIIC should have options soon, right?
My best gains are when Im not able to look at the markets all day
Is it too late for LGVW lmao, seems promising and it's not EV
When will pltr get price target upgrade? Ik eval is running off future growth currently
Did I just perfectly time the bottom for AAPL? I think I might have!
Fuck it, screwed up my last student loan on that September crash bullshit 

Staying in lawschool just for another $10k in living expense loans... throwing that bitch in a yolo and either making $100k or going broke. Idgaf anymore
I might start hedging. This pump is just too much
Some of yall obviously still dont get how this works let me explain it for you:

Buy calls until SPY hits $362

Buy Puts once SPY hits $362

Rinse and repeat
Think imma ride this wave tomorrow, sell everything and enjoy a stress free Thanksgiving.
Whats the DD on THCB?
Part of me wishes I didnt pull out of PLTR like a lil bitch but cant complain about 1k in profits really.
GM supports the EV market, EV stocks to the moon https://twitter.com/afp/status/1330972639708508168?s=21
I feel like those have have money in EVs are all feeling high/euphoric right now. And then there are those that short those company....
ICLN to 25 EOW after Trump concedes, finally.
Anyone know why ACB is up 20% after hours? My portfolio thanks it
just like august where we can go to sleep and wake up knowing our calls are going to be green
Anyone buying that GOLD pullback? The stock, not the metal.
Wait is moon an etf set up to just trace wsb?
Stocks going down fer sher
If WSB was pumping GME like it's pumping EV stocks, we could have that squeeze by now.
Another industry prime for a bubble is the mental health / psychiatry field. This pandemic, along with our lifestyles in general, is wreaking havoc on people's mental health. There's a number of publicly traded companies with novel treatment positioned to benefit from this emerging boom.
reading Yellens wiki page.


Apparently if she has access to money, its a bad idea to buy puts on major US stocks, SPX calls are the way
END THE FED. IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
The apple bribery thing is hilarious
My 12/4 530c tsla calls are going to fucking print tm
Anyone going to have trouble sleeping tonight? Cause I sure fucking am. Shits too good.
Is CIIC something we continue to hold or take profits ?
Selling CC's now is basically cash gang with extra steps.
im old enough to remember when tesla was at $60 pre-split and thinking fk that is too expensive. yo ass was prolly in kindergarten.
Weedstocks booming?
TSLA
What the hell happened to weed stonks?
ICLN $30 by eom

Where do you see NIO at EOW?
Irrational run to 3800 aaaaaaaaand go
Nikkei mooning
Softbank knows everyone will be sitting at the  table this week eating and drinking in their hovarounds  talking about EV & weed stonks. Talk their family into investing and then itll pop!  Enjoy the gravy while it lasts.
I own xpev, pltr, nio, crsr calls and ciic stocks.  Am I going to be rich?

So ive been trying this thing where when I see stupid shit i wanna yolo options on but i dont have enough money for any good strikes, i just buy 1 or 2 of the stock itself and make a couple bucks instead of totally losing it on retarted otm options that i can afford. It kinda scratches that itch while the rest of my money is tied up on my main plays. Who knew? Im coming back baby!!
Guys this wasnt trump conceding. It was GSA making a decision and trump trying to save face with his tweet.
Me wasting thousands on FDs but bending the charging cable on my iphone 6 to get it to charge properly = 
ICLN?
Will the great AMZN wake up tommrw or will it be another day, another disgrace..
Took a small L on TSLA calls today, sold for a loss and switched to NIO, up 160% at market close and seeing this AH number makes me believe I will recoup all my losses and everything will be okay.

XPEV is the new NIO, NIO is the new TSLA, TSLA is the new AAPL, and AAPL is the new trash.
I sincerely thank THCB DD guy and hope to see you in Valhalla.
Can anyone who was on WSB during the pot stock bubble in 2018 tell me if we've reached the same level of retardation in EV stocks yet?
Whats it like losing your virginity? Asking for a friend. I slay so much pussy myself

Oh wow that follow up tweet of Aight well transition was very unexpected. Its over. He got his base rallied and his narrative set for his post-presidency media career. Hes bowing out now, finally. Holy fuck.

This is the boomer life. No more stressing over options fluctuations!
THCB?? Thoughts?? Have 3k to drop tmr

Im a bear til I ran out of money, which is tomorrow. Lol Im not throwing any more in this market.
Did WSB really moon THCB, that is amazing

Alright I have a lot of money in FCEL somebody tell me what it does now 
Still wondering when that PLTR news is going to come out. Todays movement was pure sentiment.
Can BABA please go up
My moves tomorrow?  
A "movement" after my morning coffee..

Been buying AMZN puts at open for about a week, scalping $1k in the first few minutes/hour. May do that again, but with AAPL.   


Sold some Cathie ARK calls today at a 150% profit, but sorta regretting it; might buy back for 3/19s after the next TA (T&A?) opportunity. RSI high rn.  


But, on Friday before early bell, AAPL leaps it is. There will be some FOMO frenzy.
SPY leaps are a seriously under appreciated yolo. You have all the reliability of a nice diversified investment with the leverage of options and the tax cost of long term shares. And you maintain more liquidity vs holding shares to have more fun with in the short term. 

Idk why I havent gone in on these until now but it is a really solid piece to add to your portfolio
woah mates today was wild. basically just an escalator to the heavens
been holding 2 pltr 16c since 16$, and im about to exercise these bitches this week.

AAPL Pre Black Friday Special Calls now 60-90% OFF! 
Today reminded me a lot of September 2nd
BLNK going crazy
All those idiots who bought Tesla cars when they could have used the  money to buy TSLA stock.  I can't imagine taking significant money from my brokerage to buy some high ticket discretionary item. The thought of selling TSLA or AMZN to raise cash makes my stomach hurt.
looks like the market doesnt give a fuck about citron anymore
BLNK up 13 percent AH. Like damn haha.
Definitely going in on FCEL tomorrow!
[Eh, not too bad today PLTR. Still going to 25 by eow.](https://i.imgur.com/r7aUlp6.jpg)

We should be putting masks on our asses to prevent the spread of Covid through farts
Janet Yellen Queen of the Damned, Countess of Tendies, Dredgen of Memes. Deliver us to ATH.
Cramer creaming himself on Twitter talking about our favorite meme stonks, this may be the top boys :/
Sauron hangs dong
Fuel tech? Why is it up 180%? Up 60% AH. And hedge funds and institutions be trying to blame retail for this insane shit.
Who heard that glass explode on CNBC
I put $1K on CRSR last Thursday and I'm doing well so far. How much you think I should put in PLTR on Friday/next Monday? I put money in Robinhood but it will some time on Friday.
I just bought 18k worth of AAL puts at the end of today. Yolo

DIX move is scary
Where is the gain porn at? I know some people here walked out with a couple baggers.
Tesla is literally holding the Nasdaq up with all those big tech companies dumping..
More BAIC stonks, reduce FCEL stonks. More APHA stonks.

IWM already up 0.50 AH. 
I've been driving an EV for two years now and have been praising Chargepoint since day 1. Still a lot to improve infrastructure wise, but way head of the competition including Blink, Electrify America, EVgo, etc. Tons of Level 2 chargers everywhere including business parks.


Chargepoint/SBE's market cap is still only $1B?! Holy shit I am retarded for not investing earlier. Even if dips come, it's going to keep running imo.
There are definitely some fraudulent EV companies riding Teslas coattails, tagging along for the ride. The question is which ones are total scams? Need to look into this.
If we open %2.... Im going to cry
This week really feels like weaponized autism ngl
Is this the most money you ever make in a day since March?
I am not even worried about CRSR having a red day at this point (because I cant remember the last time it had a red day). I will be more surprised if it doesnt go up by at least 8% every single day (which it has achieved at least in the last 5 trading days)
EV FUCKIN MANIA!!!!!!!!!
So is THCB a bad buy because all of you are talking about it before the potential gains?
Can THCB run to $50 like HYLN did?

Welp tomorrow gonna have the biggest catalyst imaginable; ORANGE CONCEDED
So Janet Yellen will probably be the new Treasury Secretary. That means we can potentially have double the Fed printer capacity. Get ready boys for S&P 5000. If we get there I will let JPow and JYell have there way with me in a sordid monetary three way...
Pltr pumping cause creepy joe wants to analyze your data
13 percent drops after hours with no news should be illegal
Im so fucked
NIO well gonna reach 100 end of the month
APHA, AMC, PLTR. 

Which of the three has the most gas left in the tank?
Shouldve rolled my sbe 30p to 40p

what is the next memetic IPO? Roblox? AirBnB?
Where are my zoom bulls at!?
is ENG the next meme stock in the pipeline? I got into NIO late, PLTR early but I wish I was earlier. Is ENG the one?
is xpev the new nio? a 33% run in a day is literally insane. I like how Nio is more conservative and consistently runs a respectable 11-12% on a green day. I don't know anything about xpev tho so is their run up justified?
Are these after hour prices for PLTR even remotely believable?
Mango gonna act like a good lil boy? SPY to the moon!
How much we thinking HCAC is going to moon this week?
What are some plays for tomorrow? Im over my quota of 3 day trades so either buy tomorrow and wait for wed to sell, so enlighten me WSB. Already happy with PLTR, but any others?
*pokes ZM with stick 

Do something...
Does pltr make EV software? Whats driving this ?
I really cant believe that it actually appears that the market is going to hold the momentum it gained on election weeks stupid as fuck pump.

Whats even more stupid is I know the second I say, ok I believe you and go in on SPY calls, it is going to drop because thats what always happens lol.
MR. PEANUT THIEL GONNA TAKE US TO 22 AH
BABA after hours??? Today was a rest day I hope.

Still have the 2/19 290
Anyone eyeing weed plays tomorrow?
When do I sell my 20 pltr calls. Expiring 11/27
How hard to get into hedge fund? Imagine manage somebody's billion as part of a team.
Im BABA doesnt moon tomorrow.....
Should I sell my AAPL and buy NIO stocks n sell wayyyy OTM calls to you autists?
Holy shit LGVW.  After hours pop
Mo Money, more problems? Yeah.

But no money, you got problems too. So if I am gonna have problems either way, i would rather have the kind of problems that money brings.
Any reason FSR is not joining the EV party?

Too late to buy in BLNK? Someone talk some sense into me.
Im gonna need this market to maintain optimal big dick energy.

is it still too late to buy EV stocks?  
also which ones should I pick up tomorrow?
If only I didnt lose all of my money in the September massacre I would be up thousands instead of hundreds
holding tuscan holdings and longview. Sold Crsr earlier today thinking they peaked at 44. Oh well. I have a bad feeling about this week, not going to do no yolos until friday
Will this ev bubble pop? Is this even a bubble? I remember reading an article on how Tesla was about to go bankrupt early on. Just feels like all it will take is an offering from one of these ev companies to send things back to reality.
CIIC wtf
Tbh I'm kinda beating myself up as I invested most of my savings in BABA in the mid of the dip with avg of 278 instead of PLTR. Rational thinking was telling me BABA is a better choice cuz of highly undervalued and all those things mentioned in boomer economic site plus I have no idea what PLTR really does for a living with just some basic tech stuff. But jeezuz fking Christ just look at PLTR god damn I want a piece of that +15% or even more since I've been watching it at 14$. FOMOing is not an option cuz again, cash all tied up in BABA.
Its all EV talk. When does the bubble pop? Probably tomorrow because I went in this afternoon. Sorry guys.

Im at a dilemma, I sold PLTR at EOD because I was worried about the RSI being above 80, but the RSI has been up since Nov. 5th on this. Where is this going EOW guys?
I want some money to play these daily EV run ups, but its all tied up in ZM and TSLA. I have FOMO but also unwilling to exit my positions yet. 

TSLA 12/4 $505c

ZM 12/4 $412.5c
I deadass sold a few 10c BLNK 1/15/22 calls in late August. Tell me it happens to the best of us all you want, but I just want some fucking rope rn.

Thx whoever talked about DPW today
LEAPs are so boring bros...I know its the smart way to play but seeing 15% gains when the underlying moves 10% is wack.
So am I hitting SPY 363 tomorrow?
I love how AH already has more action than the entire market day
Bruhhh mango down
I think Trump genuinely believed they could challenge mail in ballots to the supreme court and win. He surrounds himself with incompetence.
Futures r mooning

Feeling cute, might limit up randomly later idk

This god damn peanut company better not *fuck me*
So BA puts at close were a bad idea lol
DKNG with that juiiicy $100 price target 
Wouldn't it be better for the market if we had two presidents? If you think about it they would constantly be competing for our love thus enabling the market to thrust via free market competition.
SOAC is a McKinsey SPAC and several senior managers at Rivian were once at McKinsey. fyi

I could not be happier to cash out on my PLTR calls and just be holding shares rn. Might have to get some more calls this week. But fuck even my shares are printing
You guys are sleeping on HP. Up 14% today and theyve got earnings after close tomorrow

Which other EV has a 5 bagger in it.? Not touching nio or xpeng
So how do I go about taxes with robinhood gains? 40% all time do I just go to someone ans they tell me what to do or something?
now that the wash of Monday on Thanksgiving week is done, and lots of money players bigger than the lot on wsb got in at lower prices on the dips today, most likely tomorrow is moving day...as in, the markets begin their general drift upward for the week.

I really feel bad for bears :( hope we dont lose all of them, theyre needed for a healthy ecosystem. Bulls cant eat without bears around. 

But I understand if you need to take a long vacation
I will never understand retail's infatuation with ACB. Screwed shareholders with a 12:1 reverse split, constant ATM Dilution raises, miss guidance regularly, and any sort of green and the SP outperforms every other cannabis name by 3x. It's comical.
Man this week is going to be so green and I love it. Dont get me wrong it def shouldnt, but fuck it baby stocks only go up.

Realistically, is it too late for PLTR?
Long-time APHA holder. It's actually a good company but it doesn't run as fast as shit like ACB. Just be aware depending on if you're a share or option person.

Bulls celebrating on a little 6pm algo news pump are about to learn what it feels like to be a bear.


Every time there is bearish news AH, the markets algo crash, then go green within 5 hours or so.


All that pump did was find the reversal point, which unsurprisingly seems to be SPX 3600


EV bulls gonna eat tho
/r/coronavirus hating on people who are traveling to see their family, these 20 yr olds who are mostly visiting their parents who are at most in their 50s not exactly high risk for covid19.
this market aint natural
QE has been the cause for the past 12 year pump. What happens when it ends, though?

When the Boomers die and the bill comes due, are we in for a multi-decade bear market like we saw between [1966 and 1995](https://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart)?

Seriously, this entire market has been fake for **years**. Stocks and the economy are now completely unrelated...

How does this end?
Too many ppl making money on dog shit stocks. Rug pull coming 
NIO 60c 11/27 & PLTR 22.5c 11/27

Retards got played by Soros. He deflected and damage controlled when he got exposed holding PLTR using his media minions. Meanwhile, he hasn't sold yet and made $$$$$$$$$$$$ while retards cry about morals and ethics. Now, the story is getting memoryholed.  It's cool tho. PLTR to the moon!

As someone who thought they were too late for CIIC and Palantir, only to see them go up 30% after the point in which I decided NOT to buy... There's plenty of time for THCB. Not too late at all.

Liquidate your whole portfolio and buy PLTR calls.

Now if BABA can just hold this after market move through open tomorrow

THCB merging with Microvast, gonna be a solid EV play that hasn't popped yet but will.
Must be the EV bears that keep downvoting here every single day. It never gets better, bears, I've been there.
I love being in a play that nobody else here is talking about because it makes me quite sure its going to print instead of dump.
When did this turn into wallstreetpennystocks?
Donnie on twitter claiming this doesn't mean he's conceding, just that he's allowing GSA to work with Biden team for now...

>I want to thank Emily Murphy at GSA for her steadfast dedication and loyalty to our Country. She has been harassed, threatened, and abused  and I do not want to see this happen to her, her family, or employees of GSA. Our case STRONGLY continues, we will keep up the good...

Need MSFT to go up at least 1% this week...any more would be a blessing.
all y'all complaining about missed opportunities so I thought I'd just add my biggest regrat other than not buying PLTR calls. I applied for free money from the government and as part of the package they gave me loans and grants. now here's the retarded part. I could have just used my student loan as 0% margin (for the 4y I'm in school), but no, my retarded ass paid that loan back right away because I thought I didn't need it. Now I'm trading on my broker's shit 6% margin.
Holy Blink
How are yall blind to BLNK...  
Anyone playing FUBO? How much more room to run do you think it could have? Only been watching for a few days seems like it will continue to move though
Wow! SUMO up 7% at 10am only to slow bleed to flat by close

**Name a more fucking iconic duo**
Last week, I blindly followed some suggestion in the daily thread to buy PLUG 12/18 $29 call. it just doubled in value since then. Probably should sell it ... or do I ride it longer?
Blink up 60% lol
BLNK saying fuck all put holders...holy shit
Apple 119 11/27
CLF IS GOING TO FLY
GEVO 
LEAP ITM vertical/debit call spreads on PLTR are stupid cheap.

Like 1.05 to enter a 15C-12.5C spread, for a total pay out of 250 per 105 capital entered if PLTR is above 15+ on day of expiration which is jan 2022. thats a 2.3x bet that PLTR stays marginally bullish on a year time line. you can move the needle closer to 2.5x 2.7x the closer to ATM you get, to being a 3x if PLTR just goes up 5% more and stays up in the next 13 months.


Free money? Its only priced like this because the IV is so high that the extrinsic value is dwarfing the intrinsic value.
That feeling when there are no OTM calls for BLNK
CLNE is the next stonk to take flight

A lot of people's retirement contributions assume assets will grow at 7% forever. These models were. Developed in the 80s and 90s and averaged back the past 30 years since WW2, which was a historical anomaly. Growth my flatten in most of the world in the next century and people may not be able to retire.
Wtf lol shit is still mooning. FTEK and DPW are insane
BLNK chill bro. You gonna bust both my nuts.

I made more selling puts today than I have made in the past 2 weeks buying calls. I might use this method for slow and steady gains. 

Can't wait to think I have it all figured out and get wrecked by this friday. 

What is another good way to look at things or a strategy to add-on to this.
Just saying, not sure what can make us crash other than market corrections at this point with vaccines within sight. Bullish market until Biden gets in and then warp speed.

Unless the vaccine causes the zombopocalypse

I'm surprised I haven't sold my NIO 45cs for 2/21 yet.  I sold my 25c 11/27 for like $100 profit each like a month ago like a total pussy.
Profit is profit That's what I tell myself when I sell 35 PLTR 20C 11-27 for $1 at noon when it hits $1.65 at the end of the day.
Wtf is FTEK lol
Beat the S&P X12. I'll take it. Good day.

Ya'll need to start talking about CLNE, it's beginning to take flight
Well that's interesting. Avril Haines chosen as Biden top Intel Chief. She is a former PLTR consultant. I would not be short this stock in the long term.
Thank God my sbe didn't hit my limit sell jeez fucking flying ah
Ive got two safer tax free savings accounts, both of which have about a 1k more money in, yet Ive made more profit from buying meme shares in my investing account. Who the fuck told me ETFs would make me a millionaire, absolute drivel

ENG over the hump. From the looks of it, they have solid fundamentals. Felt dumb fomo-ing in at 2.03 but feel pretty good about the next week.
Who the hell keeps buying PLTR? I mean...buy away but theres no way this is institutional big boy money. Fomo ftw.
Just throw a dart at a penny stock in the clean energy/EV space and become rich. Its degrading but hey, what isnt these days.
You guys see that huge order put in on PLTR a little bit ago?

PSA DPW has a working capital ratio of .36 and Debt/Equity ratio of 12.4. If you want to make money off it buy options. They're **nearly insolvent** so expect them to issue a lot of shares to raise cash into this rally.
What play is a free %100
Imagine being able to buy XPEV under $50 all of last week
What are finance nerd's feelings towards Yellen?
Is this the SPAC and EV boomtastic boom of all booms? Is tech dead ?
These after hours got me feelin like 
How does the price of the spac shares influence the market cap of the yet the purchased company? 


The default is $10 right but what if the spac shares are trading at $25 when they purchase the company? Does it just translate simply into a 1:1? So if the spac market cap is $300m then when they merge that $300m will just be added onto whatever market cap the company was previously valued at?
if ev dips tm, im liquidating all other positions and BUYING THE MOTHER FUCKING DIP
so what do you guys do with your tendies? assuming you realize them

so Trump basically conceded. and with the AZN vaccine news which can be cheaply distributed in the 3rd world, the market will probably need some info abt manufacture and distribution of the AZN vacine and move fast to price in a full reopening and world recovery. the only other big positive news would be the JNJ vaccine but that is not expected for a while

In the meantime keep buying TSLA for a month as it's likely to run in anticipation of the S&P 500 Index inclusion [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jx4hl6/sp_inclusion_and_the_tsla_hug_of_death/)

Question for Robinhooders:

If ive legged into a call debit spread (wrote calls against my long calls to lock in profit), do i need to leg out of the spread or can i just do a credit spread at those same strikes (buy the number of contracts that im short and sell the number of contracts that im long)?

Basically im wondering if RH knows if buying this credit spread cancels out my debit spread.... or if itll just open the credit spread as a separate position.

Imagine buying XPEV calls for 11/27 or 12/4 at the beginning of the month. That might be one of the biggest possible gains in a month I can recall. Even TSLA's past face-ripping rallies typically needed a couple months to get into several thousand bagger territory.

Wonder if huge crash coming or just crash in Tesla with rotation to other techs. No way finance and energy hold up s/p..unless I underestimated the power of retail retardation

Isn't the rule that when the needle goes closer to 80 or beyond you start selling, and when it is close to 20 you start buying.

What do you guys think?
Jake Paul is doing MMA? Is that real?
Have Cuomo in your thanksgiving prayers for facilitating a market pump like this.
What is the deal with THCB? Are we throwing money at cannabis again lol?
Its interesting how this game changes. Frankly, the absolute hardest mode for this game is when you have a sub 500$ bankroll. I had to claw my way back up from 200 at one point and its the god-damned hardest part. Its really hard to make good moves when you literally don't have the money for them. Once you have between 500-1k, that's like 'enough' to start making smart plays.
Ok I have 6k to throw somewhere, somebody tell me where to send it other than Palantir bc Im already balls deep in that lil slut

Unbridled enthusiasm is generally when the bubble pops on meme stonks. Every single time WSB gets all hot and sweaty about a stock is exactly when it goes tits up... Locked in my gains at close
Made $1,800 today (47% gain) on TSLA, SPY, and PLTR calls I picked up before close on Friday. I think jumped into what I thought was the dip on AAPL at 9:17 AM, to slowly watch it eat up my profit and end the day at -$1,300, leaving me at $500 profit for the day overall. Feeling pretty retarded. Fuck apple.
Question: Why do EV stock go up?

Answer: Because they don't want to let you down.
unpopular opinion: we're dumping tonight/tomorrow, approx 2ish% on NQ, 1.5sih% on ES, 3-4% on IWM.
Ok, so EV pops, then..rotate back to tech?

Trump conceited. 

He hasn't conceded yet (not officially), doubt he will ever, but at least this opens up the bureaucracy to flow.   

His last stand could end up being a govt shutdown Dec 11, I doubt this petty fucker is done fucking shit up.
Bro everything is up a shit load. Gonna have to take profit tommorow.
My biggest problem with the new Star Wars trilogy is how they basically reset everything and ran it all back. What I wanted was a motherfucking New Republic, a New Jedi Order and Luke, Leia and co. running things and dealing with new and interesting threats. And sure maybe some Imperial remnants hiding in the outer rim.

Instead we got the same old, only 1 Jedi left, and a small group of rebel heroes fighting against an evil empire

Fuck that shit. I will happily fund a redo trilogy with my Softbank FDs

Hi all, 

I have decided to start my own ev company. You will be able to wear it on your feet and there will be wheels on the bottom of them. Max speed will be 25mph and the vehicle is very environmentally friendly. You can even drive them on the highways, bike lanes and even sidewalks. My product is more reliable than Tesla when it comes to maneuvering and it simply looks better. IPO date will be on November 31st of this year. I hope youre ready for the hottest product in town.
I cant believe no one is talking about FCEL or CIIC, Im up 80% from last week

Difference between options trading & investing.

Investing you can hold forever if the price aint right, but if the price aint right on options trading  you lose all your money lol

But you can win a lot if you trade right through options. & by a lot, I mean a lot. A lot a lot.
Feel like tomorrow will be a sell the news type of day. Guessing sharp up at open, then proceed to drill the rest of the day.

I understand that a lot of stocks are going green with the vaccine news being great and being able to buy stocks at a great steal. 

What I dont understand is how CCL is continuing to climb high when they literally

A: are on the verge of bankruptcy (took $4 billion in high interest junk bonds)

B: just diluted their stocks

C: wont be fully operational until late next summer

D: have been experiencing decline profit from the year before and just had a meager revenue growth (just almost 10%)

I understand other cruises being fine, but Carnival really handled their finances the worst. 

I bought puts on it when the first vaccine news/Biden results came out. When I saw it dip on the stock dilution I kept half of the contracts thinking it was either gonna stay the same, nose dive down further, or just go slightly up. 

Instead after the first dip (10% dip) it jumped back up 6% which is confusing as fuck.  

Yes more good vaccine news yay. The economy though isnt just going to go back to normal immediately. People have debts, have to get jobs, and slowly phase back to normal life. With Carnival still burning cash I dont see how they will be profitable for a good while while paying off these high interest loans.  Which then puts it at a greater disadvantage than its competitors. 

In short, Im a gay fucking bear when it comes to CCL and I hate how autist bulls push it up.
I closed my BLNK position at +$100 because somebody in discord said its gonna dump 
Just took Rams +4, Aaron Donald about to rip Bradys dusty head off
the europumpers are gonna BUY HARD. they mostly hate trump.

NIO 6/2021 $150c
To be honest with you I feel like DPW is going to explode. I think it will be $20 by eow.
Your opinion on AAPL movement tmro?
If ACB can do that thing one more time before January I will be loaded in dough
If I have capital gains on Broker A but losses on Broker B, losses in B can be used to offset gains in A, correct?  (up to 3k?)
Whats everyones normal strategy for day trading? Weekly calls in and out? What/when do you look for for an entrance and exit?
Fuck, I panic sold SPY $360 calls because I was down $1k.  Id probably be up a grand tomorrow. 

Side note, still ended the day $9,500 positive!
Is there another decent app for watching futures? The Investing.com app is a piece of fucking shit.
What to buy for easy tendies tomorrow?
I find myself looking at Porsches on red days and kicking myself that the money I lost would have bought this Porsche or that Porsche. I dont bother looking at cars on green days because I imagine myself becoming a billionaire and owning Porsche dealers and fucking mega yachts.

Sold all my BABA positions at open for profit, and felt clever. Waiting to see if sympathy scare from Mango upper decking whatever he can before he leaves office hits China Stonks before re-entering. 

That said - Im worried about January as without stim the evictions and missed mortgages etc are going to be very very significant. Any big brains have predictions on what that will affect most of all?

Small caps are going crazy. However, if it repeats like it did the last 2 weeks. Today is the high for the week. Theyll oscillate but I think itll rest around this price by EOW. If not, well, Ill lose out on some $TNA gains but Im okay with that.
What will be a 10 bagger tomorrow that I can buy at open and close by EoD? FD obviously

Why dont people just buy spy calls at close every single day. The amount of green days v red days is like 10 to 1.
Only lost money on AAPL today! But I bought a bunch of OTM puts eod to offset. Literally everything else in my portfolio is bigly green until the inevitable rug pull when my over leveraged ass is gonna end up in the dumpster just like last time. 
Tsla up or down tomorrow? They are so unpredictable. Last week I had calls. Got mad and sold them late Weds morning, right before it started pumping.
Puts on INTC!
Calls on /MES ?
[well shit Tim Apple, is this why you red?](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55052540)

DAMNIT.... should've really diamond handed those 358 to expiration... then exercise them AH :( guh
Biden won the election! Pajamas just realized this, so we pump:

***US President Trump tweets case strongly continues and believes he will prevail, but in the best interest of the country, he recommends GSA do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols and instructed his team to do the same***
so corona is gone?
From all things being priced in I wouldve thought Biden being president "officially" (for a lack of a better term) would be IT. Based on the futures I was dead wrong
Damn, I miss when ppl were giving random awards back in September. Now, they're gone. Must be bears in their high times. Now, they're broke. 
All I see is green green green no matter what

Honestly though retards what market cap do you think NIO/XPENG are going to achieve in the near term

Just got back in after several months on the sideline. TSLA 11/27 530/535 put credit spread. Thoughts?
So around the end of October I decided to go in on some leaps. Decided then to go big on one company and small on another. Ended up with 5 PLTR 5/21 $20c at a cost of 0.50. And 20 RKT 3/19 $21c at a cost of 3.45. Fuck you RKT you piece of shit.
who else looking forward to tomorrow... but god damnit, sold my wed 358 Calls I got at the bottom today for \~20%, if held prob be 100% tmr morning. Oh well my weed and EV calls will print! tooo the fucking moon

Why does the robinhood graph cut off at 6pm when the market is open until 8?
Am I dreaming?
I didn't think ACB would get above $7.50 for awhile after their proposed stock offering at that price.
WEW SBE may break $40 tmr morning at this rate.
We were green even while Trump was pulling his BS...wtf is gonna happen now? I like playing puts sometimes but doing so these days is like throwing money in an incinerator. Fuck it. At least my long term holds are looking good.
Was looking at weed calls today expecting a shift. F
I need to turn 2k to 6k fast. Give me solid plays.

Stonks only go up
Unless the SEC unavoidably delays it, I say the HCAC/CNOO merger gets done no later than the end of next week. I say that because they're revealing the last mile delivery vehicle in early December. I'm sure for marketing purposes they'd rather be trading under the CNOO ticker when they do the reveal.
would you take internet coins as payment for your onlyfans tapes?
Gonna watch FUNFF keep climbing.

But I experienced first hand manipulation with YY in the last few days. After the Muddy Waters report, the stock was pinned at $85 for days.  
  
When this bubble pops, it's gonna be scary.
Okay, serious now. What are the odds that we continue the rally tomorrow? Dow does better on vaccine news obviously, and SPY was weighed down by tech. If tech rallies tomorrow do we have a shot at 363?
Lol. Left is now attacking BLINK

I have a bit of a riddle for y'all:  


On Saturday I was driving to the store at 10:30 PM going exactly the speed limit, there were 3 lanes and only one other car. The car, a Subaru, was driven by a California hipster (it seemed).  


The hipster got on my right side and rolled down his window to try and talk to me. I ignored him cause I thought he was just drugged up or some shit. Then he drove a bit ahead, put his hand out the window and started gesturing five, zero, five, zero over and over. I think the speed limit was 50mph but there was no traffic at all.  


What was he trying to tell me? Was he warning me of cops or some shit? I've never been gestured with that, lol.

I sold two covered calls for TSLA against my shares for $465 when it was at $453. Then I rolled it out by a week to $485. Then I rolled it out by a week to $505. Then I rolled it out by a week to $515. Today I rolled it out by a week to $535. These two goddamn calls started out at $300 each and are now $3500 each. Looks like tomorrow I'll have to roll them out again. Half of my gains are locked up in these calls now. But I kind of like it. Eventually TSLA will peak and I'll get to keep this huge-ass hedge as profit.

EVs are cool but arent they bad for the economy. No oil jobs, less repairs on EVs means less of a need for mechanics, self driving cars likely means less crashes which results in downturn for insurance companies, also self driving cars take away jobs for taxi/Uber drivers Its gonna cut jobs across the board.

Guys I might have gotten caught cheating on an online test. My teacher Zooms us during the test and makes us put the camera towards our desk where we write on the test. My friend took the test so I just had the answers up on my phone out of frame of the zoom. So everytime my teacher would look away during test, Id look over at my phone. He put up a 0 on the grade book and emailed me asking for me to talk to him after school. I think he recorded the zoom and probably saw me looking in a different direction, possibly even seeing the phone. 
How fucked am I? Whats my excuse if he screenrecorded the zoom? Why am I saying this in the Wendys subreddit?

Low key sad that I wont be able to trade tomorrow. Traveling :(

Same thing on Friday too. Hopefully my positions are safe until Wednesday at least.
Besides EV related plays and some SPAQ. I loaded up on Macys calls. Potential 10x-20x weekly baggers.
Let my $crsr 12/18 55C fucking print. BRRRRRR
Yo why the europoors fucking these minks like fuzzy fleshlights? Yall want aids-covid that is definitely how you get it
When will RKT and JNJ go back on an uptrend?
Biggest rug pull in history of nasdiq tomorrow
Holy fuck I will be rock hard the day PLTR dies and I can ejaculate to retard loss porn
Should I sell my TSLA calls. Holy fuck shit keeps going up. Scared im getting greedy
Lgvw? Thoughts
Should I take out another pay day loan? To go balls deep in XPEV at open again?
anyone use parler? don't want holocaust deniers but also dont want rasputin censoring me
When the ev bubble finally bursts, TSLA will be the only one standing
Too bullish in here tomorrow will be fucked.
Yo, the stock market is gonna go down in the spring. Why? Because it's overvalued as hell right now. Average P/E ratio for SPY has historically been around 15, but it's at 30 right now. The economy isn't going to magically rebound right after the pandemic ends. 

So why aren't people selling? Because of the way taxes work. You get taxed a lot less for gains from a position you held onto for over a year. A lot of big investors bought in when SPY was around 250 back in April/May and have already made a lot of money. If they sell now, the gains would be a lot smaller compared to if they sell it in April/May, so they're holding it hoping the stock market doesn't go down too much in the next 5 months. Once we hit the spring, people are going to be a lot more likely to sell if there's bad news than they are right now to lock in their gains.

I wouldn't recommend buying puts in specific companies though as investors probably won't sell all of their positions. They may hold on to a few stocks that are doing well at that time, but SPY puts would be a good bet. Maybe not yet, but soon. Thoughts on this hypothesis?

Why are we pumping?
PLTR AH gamma squeeze. $21.60 rn but will probably open lower
Please American man, the radical left are coming to take your liberty and drink the blood of babies, you must take it upon yourself to join the militia, take arms and consume RGR products. Buy RGR guns now the commies are at the gates. RGR before 18/12, forever RGR.
Alright guys.

I lost an embarrassing amount of money trying to short the market. Primarily because I was betting on the market dropping during election week.

Im trying to get it all back.

Thinking throwing my last $50K at SPY 370 calls a month out will be a good start, what do you guys think?
The market literally has to crash tomorrow for me to stay solvent 
Shorting **THCB**
#FIRST
Fuck  , but this pump AH is insane.  Reminds me of February right before the big dump.  

Got me nervous about my calls.
Chances of a Tesla dip to get back in 
PLTR getting rekt AH
Yes I know Im retarded for not understanding the basics even tho Im very new but I have a question. 

On CRSR I put $1k on Thursday ($36 per share) and now Im at $1230 so far ($45 per share). If it becomes a $100 per share how much would I be approx be at?
Lol
Yup
5th
Anyone in BE?
$$$$ BLNK to 35

Buy more SBE, CRSR and SLYV
Sold my APHA $6c 1/15s for a tidy 116% profit, unloaded a small part of my AMC $5c Jan 23, and hopped on the PLTR train. I am riding this shit to the moon.
Personal income set to decline 0.5% wednesday. TSLA puts tuesday EOD free money, minimal theta
ehheh up 6.9% today! its a sign!
Again, those of you who shit on NKLA for months, thanks for making my calls so cheap. Really helps me feel like a stable genius right now for loading up more and more. Thanks for the gains, retards!
Is stocks app on IOS slow or something? Says PLTR is down after hours and RH says its up

I cant find a good reason not to go all in on airline calls tomorrow. Anyone got a good reason?
[deleted]
Black dick is better than White dick.

Change my mind.
New to the stocks game. What are all these "calls" people are talking about. I'm seeing "call" on 12/18, 12/19, etc. What does it mean and what are the dates?

are they basically saying a stock will be a certain price by that date?
FCEL is the biggest piece of shit
Janet Yellen has the most boring voice.
What happened to that post about spgg
What is spy opening at tomorow?
Selling PLTR for RIOT good or bad?
Not another day of Dow Jones being up. I'm fed up with this.

The *NSYNC generation fucking sucks lol even Gen Z hates millennials. Fook outta here

Yall arent gonna make money on WSB. Its for memes. You need to find and join a discord to learn from the pros.
That being said... plenty of time for THCB
Once you realize this it's a game-changer. You never feel like you have to FOMO in ANYTHING. There is always another play, another sector, another hot stock. It's as certain as death and taxes.
Good plays are like buses. Always another one coming
amen brother
Great ted talk for new retards out there, youll eventually get used to it when you gamble long enough. Were all miss out on some trade
The truth is anyone with half a brain cell left sees the insane EV run ups and thinks it's too late, there's no way it can keep going up.  They think they are the contrarian investors at this point, spotting obvious tops.  When the truth is everyone looking at these charts is thinking the same thing, that it's a bubble ready to pop any day.  

And that is exactly why it will continue to .  The real contrarian play is seeing these insane run ups, and continue buying the top.  

It is only once the former doubters and bears finally capitulate and fomo in will the bull run be over, and the contrarian position will finally swap to shorting.
Amen brother, I'm up 62% today but I feel like shit (which I really have no right to be) cuz I know I could've made more had I picked different tickers or held some of them for longer, bruh
Its true. Proper risk management in your trading plan does not mean lack of conviction. Just in the last few months I saw dozen of these trends. If you dont blow up you will make it
Hi Jay, my name is Clown and i bought (and added) EV puts on TSLA, XPEV, NIO, LI.
HCAC is on deck for a run up
Still going, apparently.
My name Jeff
lots of room in ARYO
Hell yeah
Im proud of you son.
Your mom and I, we never doubted you
Lol same. I made $800 and I'm still mad I didnt make more on pltr. But then I keep reminding myself I made $800 while working at my reg shitty job. Fuck it profit is profit.
oh for sure dude, but what can 3k buy u tho?
Facts. I just had my best day, but I kept thinking about more $. Gotta reevaluate myself lmao
Same. But only on the broker app.
Charmim ultra soft ?
Pissed I made *only* 2k today when I couldve made 4 by not selling at open.
now you know how it feels to be a billionaire
I lost 3k today, I know how you feel
I made half my student debt in a week and the only thing I can think about is how to grow it into a house
holy... can relate
I feel the same about selling NIO when it was at 54. Oh well
One day youll hit it big my friend
13k today. Feels like Monopoly money. Half my money in options
sold my wife to follow you, we better cash out.
Should I pull out from CIIC?
Would it be retarded or autistic to use all my margin to buy shares?
LETS GOOO!!!!!!
you deserve a medal!
Checking in, 50 shares 2 warrants buying 20 warrants at open.
i got 100 shares
Godspeed you fellow autist, my only regret is not buying more.
Whys it gonna moon?
Why aren't you buying it now?
Already 5% up AH my dude
Same I think
Fuck that sucks man.  

He probably has pltr puts that piece of shit.
Listen here mate, you keep stacking your PLTR calls behind your wife until you become a millionaire with a huge a yacht, lambo, 2000 finest hoes, a mansion, and a couple Rollies then you go to your wife and ask  how much for a night with your boyfriend
Big gain day then
Well damn bro hope you're doing alright
God damn man hope ur good
Better just lose it all now so that whore wont get any of your tendies in the divorce
Sorry to hear that man. If I were in your shoes Id take  your life savings and throw it in a yolo. If you hit it, you will keep your current wealth despite having to split your new winnings with her. If you lose, less money for her in the divorce.

Every night as I watch my wife sleep next to me, I fantasize about this scenario playing out. Almost wish this ish would try me like that...
Well, with your winnings today, you can *buy* yourself a new wife...and wife's boyfriend all over again!
Sorry this hear, get a drink.
Ask him for your allowance and invest it all in more calls.
Bullish
Ask him for his picks on the market
Get a girlfriend so it balances out :)
Sell, get writing on paperwork that  moving forward your stuff is youre. Hop in on leaps
Shout out to Andrew Left at Citron. He's like the King Midas of short sellers. Everything he cries about turns to gold.

"It's insulting to call BLNK an EV stock" - Citron headline

BLNK up 48% for the day.
KNDI let's GO!!!!!
This is what happens when an entire depressed generation is given technology
When you read about the dot-com bubble. Its exactly that but a whole lot faster. Anybody who says otherwise is either too young or hasnt actually read in-depth about it.
It is the textbook definition of euphoria.
Again, there is literally *nowhere else* for the rich to park their money. It's either this or real estate.

but we didn't worry about options fluctuations today.  We just watched it moon.
Life is so nice and easy on this side. No stress ever. It's like your sitting at the beach drinking pina colada every day
3some with the printer
Yellen gonna peg JPOW and make Biden watch.
not enough permabull clowns alive to pump the amount of open calls
I dumped some of my Faang stocks today.  I still have some other more conservative investments, but it seems all the money is in EV and stock hit hard by Covid.
SHIT thats the ticker to be looking for?
"I just don't get it guys. I'm buying solid companies like AAPL and these retards just FOMO into whatever is green and profit"
Lmfao 
Oh god that channel is a sleeper. This channel is way more fun!
Its hard not to when ciic is up over 60% today
Holy shit you have almost $200k in NIO congrats! Huge gain!
Big dick poppin and little shit stoppin, or whatever TI said
nice mate. that's what I'm hoping will happen with PLTR when i decide to trade my options for shares
You deserve that flex. Well done
52 week low is 1.82
Thats some serious money, congrats
Good question, Analfister69420
did you buy puts on MJ and EV stocks before friday's close?
Bought 100 shares but now I'm thinking shouldve gotten like 400 at least
Bro, do it regardless
Puts on your relationship
My ex broke up with me two weeks ago and suddenly my portfolio started going up. Brother take the money over these hoes
Get out asap
Puts on your self esteem
Calls on you giving her head
Just hand over your gf to the bears and they will do the rest
Based on other autists experiences this week, breaking up is the path to tendy town
Felt the same way, still bought a couple calls just to see. Glad I did.
I was DOWN 50% in the first week of Sept.  after today i'm up 94% for the year!
Congrats!

Got to have money to make money. Sucks being a poor.

I bought AAPL calls this morning, though the rest of my portfolio almost made up for the losses there.

This bubble is ridiculous and I love it
I bought 187 shares of THCB at close and some more CIIC.
CIIC is MOVING
That's a fresh ticker, what's NBAC?

This is hearsay and I'm making it up ***wink wink*** but it's not happening.

This sounds like cannabis 2 years ago.

Edit: actually this whole EV rally feels like cannabis pre canadia legalization.
its only Monday
Been a great few months for that imo
Amirite?! Or a stock split so us peasants can get some whole shares not this fractional shit
lol its stuck.
AMZN is rkd, crap is flooded with chinese garbage, CS is no longer customer centric, my last couple of interactions were a black hole just to get a few dollars refund gonna cancel prime and be done with it.   Only thing holding wmt back was ecommerce now that is in gear they are the new AMZN, distribution, clientele, personnel, everything in place to moon I can see them at Costco valuation of course with splits incoming $200-300 by 2021 eoy.
Jim harbaugh is a close second
He gave 100 M not 1 B. But still. Also he put in like $18 million into Texas the last week and that shit proved futile too. 

Yea. His political instincts are atrocious. He should just quit.
Sounds like the average tenure of a dummy in this sub but losing $10,000 instead
His goal was to make Bernie lose and trump lose .

He won buddy and the billion is nothing to him. 

He spends a lot more money than just Florida . He almost caused GA to turn blue in 2018 and is on the verge of success now
Shame cause he was a great mayor
He paid enough to have influence with the Dems though.
He spent a 1b to keep Bernie from being pres and he was successful.
Manlets when will they learn?
It's not like all those dinosaur car companies aren't making/going to make EVs aswell.

These market caps for EV are ridiculous (yes gay nio bear here)
And where are all the companies who make predominantly petrol cars gonna go. Just gonna step aside while a couple of newish companies take over the world?
They will be there when they need to be.
got 100 shares before close.. lets see where this goes
450 shares bought at noon.
jesus once it was mentioned on here it pumped 7%
Check out THCBW too. Rose over 30%

See you tomorrow when you open your new account. Let me know if you need a referral link for robinhood (we both get free stocks).
You have to be a bear, but god speed fellow retard
yep,
I can only get so hard
So how does the floor price work? If the merger doesn't go through you just sell the stock for $10 a share through your broker?
sweet. can't wait to FOMO in at $20.00 at 0930 and then lose 50% by friday

im starting to feel the same. actually.yes. yes i feel the same.

Dude I said this last Friday and said fuck it because I was salty af. It paid off big today. Hope you get the same high I did when I opened my account
9/10 of the clowns saying shit like that dont own any puts. If you buy puts I can at least respect you. 

If youre constantly posting about a crash without profiting off of it just so you can say see I told you so youre a fucking loser.
Ill be there when it does though
Tried to jerk it earlier and couldnt orgasm really pissed off I gotta stop jerking it so much
Take me with you
Youre gonna get fucked so hard and then look back at this and realise how naive you were. I was there trust me. Be cautious
Just wait. 

It'll bite you in the ass shortly.
Thats how it starts. Start with 5k. Turn it into 30k in a few weeks. Debate quitting job. Correction happens and youre down to $500. Guess what stage youre in...

Are you saying ZM will go up this week?

>We're still in the middle of a pandemic, with unemployment numbers that continue to be historic.
The economy and stock market decoupled in 2009 with the onset of quantitative easing. Arguably even before that, but it was 2009 when the divide between Main Street and Wall Street began to widen to a chasm where people couldn't help but notice it. It's only become larger since and with this mega bubble we're blowing....there may be no turning back. The market is the economy now, at least until all the boomers are dead.
Lmfao
Youd prob be rich af rn but that was a reasonable decision. How you gonna pay rent w Bitcoins? Most landlord are boomer cucks

That is a gross oversimplification of MMT. There are limits to the amount of USD you can theoretically print even under MMT. 

That being said, I still do not buy MMT in the slightest, but I would like to learn more about it before I can say for certain it is complete BS.
MMT is less retarded than mercantilism which dominated western economies for centuries.
Best Green Day in awhile
Today was definitely a good one. Futes looking good too!
What a week and a half
How.....
 like, how?
#boomergains
Yea
Amen
And thank you Andrew Lemon for creating a dip for me to buy more - appreciate it.
Cocaine is a helluva drug
EV market retarded, but making bank on cyclicals are retail won't quit. That being said I'm going to keep day trading stupid meme bullshit until the crash...
Lol that is literally the mantra of the bears
It can - there were plenty of stocks that took a dip today...
There are going to be some serious bagholders one of these days. Wouldnt sleep in, Ill put it that way lol
My thoughts exactly... dating back to Nov 4th already. 

I am on the edge.
already felt like today was a blowoff top but judging by AH action they might do another tomorrow.
I'm buying more warrants 9:30 am
Yes
>TCHB 

is there any news to drive the price up ?

I gurantee 3/4 of the stock that moved today was because of the DD here
Wtf is a blank check company
What time to buy tomorrow?
i dont want to hear those words ever again son
 But once it moons, oh baby will it moon
?? My warrants are already up 50% on the day and thats before the after hours pump it had
Any idea when options are coming?
WEEKS?! WE AINT GOT TIME FOR THAT
What price do you think it hits after merger announcement? Will it pull a CIIG and hit high $20s?
750k  in XPEV retire on Wednesday
Annnnnnd it's gone.
So all in on PLTR leaps. Niceeeeee!
What did you learn to protect your profits?
Damn and here I was so proud of my $3k gains
I already bought some shares but Im getting sketched out since youre pumping this so often bro
THCB 
I love you
thank you!
She gonna be a thicc bitch
Its a fucking rush. Youll be back
eventually you get desensitized!
See you at 9:30
Same, made $1500 today off PLTR and TSLA and I'm now like fuck, I could use that for Christmas presents and gay shit but also if I cash out, TSLA will hit $700 and PLTR will hit $45
> never touching the stock market again

What a liar - you've had a taste, you'll definitely be back
Stay, staaaaaaaay. Turn that 2500 into 25k!
I do it for the fun of gambling
Youll be thinking about this all night and wont be able to sleep. See you tomorrow at 9:30.
Sounds like you need a bump bruh
Being way up over night stresses me the fuck out.. Especially if I could have sold for like a 1000% profit that day

Losing 5k sucks, but its not near as stressful
Emotions get dulled once you've made a bunch and lost just as much multiple times. It's still exciting but it's not the extreme excitement or fear you experience the first time or two
Whats a stock? Bro you gotta try options, they are easy
jerk off whenever in doubt
 need more tendies 
Taking profits is never a bad idea. For me, its about managing risk  what am I comfortable losing? That amount increases as my profits increase, which I think is healthy. However, it does tend to distort your sense of monetary reality over time, as you might feel sick about losing a couple grand in a day, but not really view it as a major loss, where if you had an unexpected car repair that costs $2k, youd be gutted. You have to be really careful that your stock market money stays *real* to you.
See you Monday
just a number on the screen. gotta make sure you read other peoples DD about the same company, then go on r/stocks and do it there too. then put money in and look back in a week or two 

Holding till 10 years
Now go and pay 500k-600k taxes you owe to mother merica.

+1
Finally dumped my March 150 calls
Theyre already peeking their heads out saying futures are about to be rug pull
You dont need college if you can trade well.
You've said it out loud. Take yourself seriously. Tossing out your college education is the worst kind of FD. No joke reading this encouraged me to delete my reddit app right now. 

See ya everybody.
Honestly same. Right after my systems physiology exam this morning I was trading. Trading with a fried brain gives you extra chromosomes though so thats a plus
Someone else that remembers the golden week

Thats the whole plot of the big short. Daddy Bale was right in realizing there was a bubble, but he had to wait so much that he could have made money being a bull in the meantime
That's what I decided too. Stocks only go up from now on as far as my stocks choices go
Word on the street is MMs hate when people make money on shorts
Bears.

In.

SHAMBOS.
Imagine?  Thats definitely a reality for 25% of the people here, sorry to say they are FUCKED, I almost bought BA puts but didnt pull the trigger thank God
All my spy gains are going to get destroyed from my ev puts... I can imagine
I have puts but also am balls deep in EV. I still think were gonna crash soon
But theyre all so high? What are the entry points? Like example strikes and entries
Not deep into margin? Okay boomer.
Im negative cash
Weak. At least -10%+ cash or you're not even trying to play.
The way
2025 for sure.
lol bro its juuuuuuust gettin started
It's not $30 is it?
Nah
Only if you hate money
Im loading the fuck up tomorrow.
Im getting more shares at open. Holding until it reaches at least $17-$20

Should I go all in THCB or half THCB half LGVW

Yes
Both, diversify

Lmao almost same for me besides my long term stocks. Works till it doesnt right? Haha
Youre rich
Same
At least you didn't buy into a holding company that's about to turn into an EV company
remember not to wear it for > 20 minutes
I mean it definitely is insane historically
People in r/stocks and r/investing content themselves with basic 6%-10% annual. Its not bad because its easy to be that safe. But this day and age demands far more if any of us are actually going to be able to retire comfortably

TL;DR safe money dont make money
Lol. Thats like.. 2 day gainz mang
Lmao dont pick on em
Thats what happens when your brains are fully developed, you can only act retarded.
A year? No ones got time for that shit, I want it now. Ill probs be dead in a year; gains.
CIIC moved nearly that much in a single day lol
Do you have more?

Aal leaps..it is still down alot compared to other airlines..will catch up soon.
Take a look at LIT, lithium ETF.

https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/lit/

Optionable with low IV.  Its lithium producers and battery makers.
WTF,
something is wrong with the bull calculation
Ask your therapist, he probably has some risperdal to help with that
It cant perform worse than Baba, I bought 2k of warrants and actually up 400$
Pretty much the same I kept adding and ended up with shares and warrants by the end of the day.


We're up 4% ah so not complaining
I'm basically trading SPACs nonstop and dumping all profits into PSTH. You get into THCB yet? Up and coming meme stock
Same. I need a flair that says "will suck dick for SPACs"
PIC bro it's the future. Look this bad boy up and tell me if this isn't going on a Jupiter mission
I might wctually hop in on this. I am coming after you if we shit the bed

But its close to 10 so not too much downside risk hopefully
MM are probably going to rape us when the market opens, though hahah
Thats the WSB way!
Right there with ya brother.

Is a meme stonk good for long term?

Yes
XPEV yah. If the rumoured P5 is $150k rmb Teslas gonna lose for sure
NIOs market cap is 1/6 of TSLAs...theres plenty more room to run
Theyre both good but kinda expensive rn wait for a nice pullback/correction.
Just ride the wave dude, if it falls hard, sell
Oh we realize it... we're playin a game of chicken here and we aint sellin
You will regret selling when it goes up even more
dont sell, i sold ciic at 23, been regretting that for the past hour
Yeah it's fucking insane.
Big dick over here
11K into 60% stocks 40% warrants here


What is it
we are gunna be rich rich
Is it that bad tho?
THCB only bro
Yeah probably tomoz will be a low gainz or slightly - ve day. That's to be expected after a monster rally
Bullish
oh fuck imagine the market reaction to Trump conceding
This is fcking bullishh lol
yassssssss pls
SURE

There was a reporter analyst on Bloomberg radio today that basically said we havent even seen euphoria.
"What about the shake....they don't need dem"

"Just a bowlful!!"
Got some $9.0 $ACBs today, let's gooooo
What was your cost
No way to lose money today.... Unless you bought LGVW at open. Can you guess what I did at open.
Good lord I hope you exercise
And still sitting there with cash in your hands
Its the only time Fomo works
And then they upgrade PT's 


You betting more on shares than you did with options though?
Just buy 2-3 months out from expiration close to the money and sell when it goes itm. Ezpz
Shhh..
Lol the irony
Rolled my 250% NIO options into NIO stocks on margin.  no complaints.
Same
i've found more success augmenting a portfolio with options to speculate or to leverage into more expensive tickers with ITM strikes
Yeah dude cruizer and plug trek

Great EV companies!
Is it EV? Looks more like some utility contractor or something. I bought a call when it was +90% today and it looks like it will actually print. Should have taken the gamble and went all in.
Buy and hold TSLA. Got it.

It's fucking magic is what it is. This is the true sense of the holidays. Kicking it with your fellow idiots making BANK talking MAD SHIT to bers bc they are FUK!
this is the way
How so?
What if EV isn't in a bubble 
Give me one reason why it would pop

When did you buy?
Next week
The only long I have. Sold lotsa puts @ 250 when it was 252. That day was WTF. Theyre either going out of business or up.
Yeah, probably shouldn't call random people retards in the real world.
Or they do, it is just that the same word can either be a compliment or an insult.
The terms puts and calls have entered my modern day parlance way too much. Sex store running out of jelqing devices? Puts on them!
Our time has come
i hope so cause i have calls that i want to sell
I hope HK is leading our market, they opened over 280
44k to 105k
I'm not self employed but I matched with a girl on tinder who was

Chinese EV battery company.
Buy now in AH, 10% risk ain't shit
Yeah, THCB picked up momentum really, really, really fast today. Wondering if MMs and whales are gonna catch on tomorrow or not... could be an easy scalp
Yes!

Decided to be a gay bear with BABA
That means buy
I mean he has a point, this bubble could burst for BLNK at any point.
Me
November is worse than spetember and october for me, especially because of these choppy days. Not only choppy but tech is slowly bleeding as well. And then AAPL took a big hit today as well, so....
Yes...baba, spy puts from friday, spy calls from friday, apt calls. Mara, CNK, and cript0 coins offset loses so came out pissed down only $700. I think Im done trading spy altogether, I always lose money on spy regardless if its a call or put and itm when purchased

Always stick your finger in first, do you even gloryhole?
Reminds me of shitcoin years earlier "This is just the beginning"
If it's good enough to screen shot, it's good enough to sell.
You're not wrong.
Rotation into dem in the WH positions which was bound to happen as soon as positive economic and Vax news hit?

Ugly for bears
Every time you feel like selling NIO bring up the TSLA 5 year chart. TSLAs competition my man.

You would have 8x21.90 contracts cuz fuk math
Apple is worth $2 trillion bud 
It'll be like the robot company in i-robot.
That dude needs a ban. Fuk that guy

Moon was last week, this week is Mars
Add KNDI. Up 30% today on 0 news
Why would they be impressed by $17.42 plus margin
So you not in the negative?
I dont associate with the poors
Dont tell anyone you invest. Last thing you need is someone asking you for tip then blaming you when the shit hits the fan
Homie, Im down over 30k, they wouldnt ask me for shit at this point.
Cramer suggested FSR over NIO a few weeks ago. Lol
Dont feel too bad, I jumped into Solo and Apple... we can feel bad together.
lol even HYLN pumped... pitty pump but still got one turn in that pussy lol
Learn from it, often if one stock in a sector isnt performing well like the others, most of the time theres a good reason for it
You do realize 5bagger means they hit 50 a share right?
But its already shot to 11+ AH can you really hope to corral the autism in here? I personally think this has better legs than most EVs that are running right now. But it was your DD so do you think there's a better entry rolling up to Dec 7th?
Until all vehicles on the road are EV
End of 2035
6+ Months.
a SPAC is a SPAC but an EV SPAC is a 
Not sure what it is but got in for 250 shares LOL
Freeeeeeeee moneeeeeeeeyyyyy
Its a blank check company merger with a EV battery maker based in Texas. See DD : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzkpv1/i_made_the_dd_on_ciic_last_week_now_i_am_moving/
Some pump and dump small cap stock
ITM calls it is
Then closes at 0.00000%

It's so great... (\*wind noises from gaping asshole\*)
Dude Id buy you breakfast if true.
Cant blame a kid for dreaming

Sounds like something a dog faced pony soldier would say
Just let the retards miss out lol
I'd like to point out that if the merger happens, the price can shift below $10. It's not likely, but it can happen.
That makes sense don't they make most of the cars in the world?
Elon won't stop until it's 100%
Makes sense, they sell 1% of the cars
Painful isn't it
For real, I am running out of cash to buy
dont buy puts, just hold your cash if you're not buyin calls
you havent learned the first thing about stonks. 

they only go up.
Just start praying to Lord Jerome Powell and he will guide you to overcome the repentance
Just stick your dick in it and let it ride u fuckin pussy
Honestly the smart thing to do is to stay cash til the unwind starts. It won't be all overnight so have some alerts on tickers in mind for when it starts. BLNK is the one I'll take the biggest position on probably.

If you buy puts you'll get ass fucked by even 2 days of flat.
Okay, so what's happening here is emotion is fucking with your head. You need to flip that around. You need to treat "the market" as a group of irrational people. Basically just imagine 10,000 random Floridians and ask "what would they do?" Think logically about the emotions of other people.

As inspiration, just follow any stock dude who believes in following the trend. Look at the money they make. They'll never show you losses, so you'll feel like you can't lose and that should stop you from thinking it's always the top.

If none of that works, then you are truly a reversal play investor. Start learning how to play reversals (it's a real strategy that many professionals follow; not joking). If your only insight is "whelp, it has to go down (or up) eventually" then you know absolutely nothing about playing reversals and need to start from the beginning.
Think of it this way. 25% chance you get boned on a weekly where you lose it all. These calls keep returning 100% lately. If you only use half of your money then you will be rich as fuck even if the bottom falls out. I was a bear and turned 7k into $600 over 4 months I switched to being a bull and I turned $600 into 7k in one month. If I lose half who cares.
If you want to buy a bottom PAAS or gold will likely bounce within the week.
I also pay this fella $20 a month for his chart picks. 1/4 are 2x baggers 1/2 are good gains and 1/4 are fucky. My best plays were picked by him.  


[https://www.youtube.com/user/stoztrader](https://www.youtube.com/user/stoztrader)
Stock market doesn't work like that anymore. Pump on the rumor, pump on the worry, pump on the positive news, pump on the negative news, pump when it happens, pump after it happens. Every event gets like 7 pumps at least.
People were still optimistic.
The markets transitioned to buy the news and the news were buying is no trump coup attempt
It'd a euphoria market. Everyone is just sotting there waiting for an excuse to buy. Doesn't have to make sense.
There was a chance, even a tiny chance, that Trump would keep this charade going and cause uncertainty all the way through January when the runoff elections for Georgia happen. 

This move to concede projects that Trump will bow to GOP pressure and focus on those senate races instead of use them as leverage for getting his way. 

Basically, small uncertainty removed in regards to peaceful transition of power, and also increased odds of GOP holding one or both of the senate seats up for grabs in Georgia.
Think so
it been a meme stock dawg
thcb
lol u bought 4k of shares... damn I only got 1000 up 50 bucks lol
The next meme stock lets go
lol... yes hahahah we're our own hedge fund
thats a fact
Don't underestimate WSB's meme potential.
Every ev is pumping ah
20+ when merger happens.  Maybe.
>I picked up the warrants - THCBW.  
>  
>Also own EOSE which is another battery play formerly a SPAC.
How does it feel
Youre not alone
Not too late brotha, hop into some of the SPACs that havent exploded yet - NGA, NBAC have a lot of room to run
More OTW... more going now. Always the king ding-a-ling's run up to S&P inclusion. Get your money transferred and buy something.
How
How do you value the FUTURE?
Stop, I can only get so erect.
fuck apple its for boomers get into EV at open ride to close = free money
This is the way
Whats the expiration?
Could still gap up.  Depends where the rotation goes.  Even AMZN  got a move on
I feel like a dumbass
buy leaps diversify get sleeps
Read about spy calls on here bought 5 at 270 each having no idea what option was. Went up a lot the next day, I bragged to my wife. Then straight down fast. Didn't know to sell them they expired worthless.
Yea because I finally started trading options august 28th.  Fucking September wiped me
Most people quit when it goes that poorly the first time
Yep. Bought a $800 SPY put at the bottom of the March crash and it expired worthless. Then the addiction started.
I lost 2k buying XLF calls in may off some random retards post here
the fact it was tsla says enough. focus on cheaper stocks.
Call that European ambulance then...but not for me
My ba calls about to be a ten bagger
What more could an autist want?
My Jan calls like how you think.
Oh, stop it, you
Pleaseeeee
On god
Pennsylvania still has to certify the votes. Maybe Biden wins again Wednesday.
Play the pattern and buy vaccine stocks for the next pump
Dec 10. EUA granted to Pfizer. Dec 11, Pfizer being distributed to centers for use. December 12, Pfizer being administered to Medical staff at covid centers and at risk patients. All while inbetween now and then will be news of Pfizer 10M doses created. Next day 12 million. 14 ext. All the way till it happens. As soon as it stops. Moderna! Pumps will not stop.
KNDI can hit 20 end of month for a smaller pay in as well. But YEA to my NIO calls as well!
You son of a bitch I'm in
Fuck it im in
Aapl with the continuation dip to 100

Baba with the sideways action

Fomo into EV is the play
Im pretty sure if I added it up AAPL has probably cancelled 10% of my profits all time at least, idk what it is with my decisions going into it. So at this point idc if it goes 300 EOW not playing it, its fucked me too much too often. But good luck man
Seriously that was stupid as fuck. Hope it has a 5% day tomorrow at least
Preach. Have no money to average down so we just getting railed. But if we can make 280 by Wednesday Ill be ok 
Just Chinese stock things I guess. TSM also tends to move big after/before market, makes timing very difficult
Same brah
BABA
FAANG? How soon we forget.
Amazon.
Like more EV
Nah. Going to reinvest in EV thats only doubled in the last month instead of quadrupled. Those still have room to run.
Wisest words of the night
Like Apple and Amazon
Take half. Let the other half run.
Ev party is just starting, joe b green deal gonna pump this shit to mars
In more EV that hasnt run yet *cough* HCAC *cough*
HCAC is the way

I personally sold the last NIO I had at open. It hurt to see the gains today, and I sure hope this doesn't end up being like not buying Tesla at 300 in March pre split, but I just don't see how NIO is at 55 rn.
How are EVS getting re-re?
Just set stop limits. My entire portfolio is up 36% with NIO carrying the brunt of it,

You should try buying different things.
Definitely need to take a break. Youre worse than a monkey starching its ass.
Right there with you bb. The worst part for me is id be up a fuck ton if I werent such a pussy ass bitch two weeks ago and sold my calls and shares of xpev
KNDI let's go
I did. Hopped out of NIO. Came to this reddit channel. Hopped back in a few hours later without much pain. Thanks to you guys.
TANH up almost 65%. Just wish I had bought more this morning.
GET OPTIONS, NERD
Nice buy.

No theyre just the only stonks that are fairly priced that we see. After a shit ton of growth since corona the FAANG stonks need a lil breather before they can carry on fucking
Yes. Im afraid so. Theyre the new consumer staples.
They absolutely are
Am I missing something?? It says it only went up $1
Stop with your THCB shits
Yeap we have gathered enough power to become a force. We are the many.

Back at late-August levels! I was just saying this felt like a similar type of euphoria

We aren't even at Dec 2019 levels of greed yet lol

I dont have anymore money
You are invested world wide!!!
Why not buy now?
he conceded?
Wtf I love war now
Why would you kill yourself for buying in and selling at almost double
 Nah dude thats a solid gain
that's a solid gain, nut up
You get in, get your $$$, and GTFO. Pat yourself on the back for a job well done and move to the next trend.
Confession. I was in Nio at $5 and sold at $6. Bought back in at $30 though
Quit now, your brain aint right for this
Wow weak mentality 

Dont sell next time
Bought in again today up 65%

Hong Kong price x jack ma head circumference^2 = US price
Doesn't really work that way, just pay attention to the percentage.
Multiply baba HK price by 8. Insert that number in HKD to USD converter = usd price
[9988.HK](https://9988.HK) share price x 8 then convert HKD to USD.
At the open it hit 283.39 USD, if were even close to that tomorrow

Use google dude
Theyre leaps.  Way too early to bail now.
Top is in tomorrow. Thanks for the heads up.
Market will correct on EVs and move back into tech. They are leaps, keep em
Fuck that, memes are going to be good.

Creepy Joe is going to make a come back.

Short DD?
lol... fuck that noise we going past ATH now boI
ahem, I like to call it ORGANIC GROWTH.
I was in and out. Ill play with day trades but holding overnight or buying in after 20%+ days is how you lose money.

Nah not for Bears. I think they extinct now
These three gotta have their day soon. I just joined them, Friday and today
nvda, baba, and rkt haha

It is still not too late to switch.
Get into ev!! Time is now!!!
Hey bro I made 20% day trading MSFT and it got me enough cash to buy another 100 shares of PLTR
Sell and put into ENG we gonna moon $10 EOW!
I totally did! Sold at 23.5 - nevertheless, gains are gains. Hope you hop off on the moon
don't ask questions. just buy....... it's a chinese battery stonk. they probably power xpev and nio who the fuck knows. it's chinese EV and stonks only go up.
Something about a battery lol. Its another SPAC
I assumed it was a weed stock and looked it up. Still not sure.

I think it has something to do with Tusken Raiders.
Insider info here folks
was just thinking that
Is that you? Masayoshi sama?
4.5k THCB shares here too. LETS FUCKING GOOO
nice.  I bought into THCB and HCAC at lunch, too.
Merger is being announced early December
I keep thinking its THC like weed
I'll be sitting at my computer at 9:30 waiting to take profits. But then of course I'm also okay with a long position. Charts show potential. Even if XPEV dropped 30%, we know $70 is attainable next year.
All made by GM, Ford and Tesla.
You wanna be part of this legacy.
Made by toyota and none of these companies will exist
Because its got a giant fucking cock and it knows it
Jumping off the express train half way to your destination. At least put your winnings into another EV stock.

Congrats/F
Orange fuck can still mess it up with the next temper tantrum
I bought at AH but based off of no information and I was feeling some big d energy
Now. If it slips slightly tomorrow it'll tank at worst to ~10.00, but if it flies you just lost out massively.
AH
probably gaps up AH and before open. I would just get it now and hold til 30.
HCAC thank me later. American EV
Which ticker?
That's an OOF for the bulls
wtf does this mean
Oh boy, here we go again.   justifying their poor moves. Look up the guy that based all his moves off DIX and GEX. REKT...
Lol
100%
all the way high
Hopefully above 25 by 1/2022
Remember something is always better than nothing. I lost 99% cause I was greedy
Hey man you never lose money locking in profits to early tho. Theyll always be another opportunity.

Memefolio DD is newly hyped in daily discussion threads so this is a surefire winner
Yes
If it helps I too have 1000 NIO shares I bought at $11 and I did hold.
RKT is such a terrible stock. My wife and I are originally from Michigan so she refuses to let me sell the shares from IPO day. What dead fucking money. She wont even let me sell calls because she doesnt want to lose them. Seriously. 
Not really, only 2-baggers.  IV is pretty high
I set twitter alerts for Citron so I can buy all  of those dips.

I mean the smaller ones are great, but TSLA does buy the fucking Lambos fo sho.
yes
I think so
Dont do it yet. Sold all my BABA, my biggest position, last week knowing Cheeto is going to try to fuk Chyna. Doesnt matter if he can or not, matters that the rumors will keep it down. 

Look at all the Chyna stonks that may be affected. They will be flat or close to it until the transition.
Rofl

Wtf was I thinking selling covered calls on my shit at close.
Heavy breathing intensifies
more and more of the world is moving towards greener tech
Today I made 10k. First time ever. I'm re-thinking everything, especially my job.
It better be my calls bled all day
fuck yea bro, right here with ya. especially today I got some calls and it feels really weird with all the shit going on and wejust trynna make tendys
yes and YOLO unless you wanna be a wage cuck
Yeah I'm pretty sure most people here are both:

- Started trading this year

Dude I sold $22 covered calls, but I mean profit is profit
lol i sold those when it was flat-lining at $20. i'm worried too
You done goofed
You have nothing to lose
I sold a $23 covered call.
Start hitting those spreads man. Been doing that lately and honestly. Yes lil less profit but my god Ive been consistent on it.
Whats the difference with the warrant?
Same boat but feb
Did the same at the same time, not down a lot, thinking of doing the same... except I am straight on PLTR (because when I got it, it don't do shit).
 Which ones?
I'm a simple man. Someone posts SPAC capital letters, I buy 100 shares.
Ppl still play AAPL?
Just put your money in BABA like a true commie bastard and make money like the rest of us. AAPL is over valued even at this price, better off with MSFT tbh
I got some of those!!!!! Let's goooo
Ugh I want to buy some at open
Could only grab them in my ira sadly. Tastytrade cut me off. But grabbed 500 shares also
>Butterfly do make Rockets fly.  
Im in.  But it was flat most of the day.  Hoping it goes up.
Unless youre trying to lessen your gains for tax reasons or something Id skip rkt
$30 was the price I said I would sell at.  

Was joking with the Mrs at dinner that maybe I should bump it up to $40.
i came
Stop be greedy! Lets start at $39 first.
Whats the news?

Just go monthlies bro
RIP to your puts.
Oh, that was you! Thanks. Havent seen that ticker on any other posts in here. Ive been trying to tell everyone about a stonk called NIO.
BABA $290 EOW
Scope HCAC. Hasnt run yet
How long will this last lol
Tan to the 
Trump is trying to make sure people dont think there will be a bloody coup so that the market wont price that in and will soar. Otherwise the market would have it priced in until biden was inaugurated and then it would soar under Biden which would make trump a sad panda

This is going to be the next prpl
that stock is suspect as fuck
And if it doesnt, buy me a ps5?
NIO AH is looking hot


Bears are extinct
Just wait for history to repeat itself, as it always does.. those people dont come back from it so thats why you never hear from them on here
Not true. Its much easier to be a Bear. Not if youre shorting ETFs & Memes. But most real Bears dont. U might be a little early sometimes but when youre right, kurtosis takes care of the rest. Recent example: I was early on NIO @ 1SD, sold a 11/20 36c on 11/2. As time went on @ 2SD sold 4 11/20 47c on 11/12. Made up everything & a whole lot more. Been a Bear for 10 years, in the most absurd Bull market in the history of the planet & have never had problem making tendies. In fact, from 2014-2019 one of my biggest winning short plays over & over again: TSLA. That stopped for a few months, came back on the table after the split. But your gauge is based on broad market moves. There are plenty of short plays everyday & theyre easier to pick than u think. Sold NIO12/18 55c. Lets see how they turn out. Not scared. GL, M8!
Buy LMND. Its going to be a meme stock in 2021
Narrator voice: ...
quit describing my situation :/
Fucking retards
Shhhh dont tell them ITM means automatic as long as it doesnt drop
Most people here buy weekly FDs I imagine
what else does it mean? it mean in the money so sell sell sell dumass
Why do you recommend it?
Took my last doses on Friday with a buddy.  I am bummed I am out now and only do it once a year, but damn.... amazing.
Whats the comedown like from LSD?
wud be real nice. i know no one with either.
dont fry your brain on that hippy shit
All the way up
that would be great so i can sell
Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of stonks
Li auto next????
Jeez, to the moon 
GME tomorrow.  This ones for all those fucks who laughed at me when I said I am holding GME.
You're not crazy if everyone around you is stupid
You get numb to it
Yeah, that's why you gotta learn quickly and move to LEAPs. You can still make day trades, but it's better when you have those boomer leaps in the background giving those guaranteed tendies.
Everything will. Cramer was scaring all the boomers into thinking Trump was going to refuse to leave office. Theres nothing investors like more than stability.
Pump then dump. Good luck timing the dump, though. I wonder how much of this buying is short.
Yeah evs havent gotten much action recently definitely due for a pump
Please. Ive been bagbolding my ICLN long enough
have you not seen AH?
Biden isnt going to tweet
Only thing hes pumping is kindergarten enrollment.
Hes not going to because its not the job of the president
Id vomit gold coins and shit silver....
Lolz. I abandoned ship when it hit 40 :(
Lol don't tell me people are actually writing those contracts
> AAPL

Been trading at this same price since 9/8 lmfao
Ok boomer
Bro what strike did u buy and when did u get in

As a long investor in Apple, I would say there are a lot better places to put your money right now.

Seriously I wish I get more I was gonna average in I didnt expect it to go like this haha

Didn't expect it to peak at $27 today. I should've held a little longer.
I sold way too early on that to play PLTR and now look at THCB AH killing it!

I was buying calls and shares back in March at the bottom but decided to listen to retards on here. FUCK
Maybe he should cry some more
Hes trying to have something to point back to after hes been shilling these for months, for if/when valuations catch up or something funky happens with Chinese listings or whatever other reason would cause them to cool off
he might be right on this one. Those EV gains are extreme. Those kind of % gains are rare in the market. Might as well take that cash money.
OTM TSLA FD LOTTO TICKETS FTW
I was only down -97% all time. I should have tried harder.
Cause they dont know if hes gonna die tomorrow or not
Timing of initiating the formal transition process matters, and was unknown.
I am so glad I canceled by BABA order last night and instead put it into PLUG
Looks like the next 4 years is going to be a bear slaughter.
I was bear over weekend and for once switched to bull at just the right time
20% rise after a 15% day?..
Sir this is casino.

lol... no idea? maybe WSB got in before all those actual retards on Wall street did? and they fomo'ing?
If I had sold every time I held I wouldnt be down $28k
sold my xpev for 100%, only for it to run up another 300% fml
Fuck so did I. Oof.
WH agency basically calls for Buyden and will start the transition process. Its basically over for Drumpf.
Bulls are fucking the bears dead corpses
Very cool and very legal.
excuse me while I puke for buying puts this afternoon.
I feel you, I sold them this morning after a 7.5% gain. They're like 19% now
THC, Bitch
A shotgun after I sold my whole account worth of weeklies this morning for a 30% gain instead of a 300%
Still down 70% haha YTD
Fuck me. I had a 5% trailing stop that triggered and sold all my shares at 7.96. Didn't have time to be looking at my portfolio today
Im gonna go jerk off to the thought of that 
Check out their paychecks compared to yours and youll know who the  is. 
I feel insulted
She kinda dirty I like

i mean yes, yes it will moon, floor is 10, people know
Damn you got the good shit!
Never bad to lock in gains.
It ain't trickin if you got it
Aphria calls for April are my choice
Im huge on HYLN but EV is completely exploding and HYLN has a real product with an amazing vision but its hardly budging. I have so many shares but it just sits there while Im missing out on so many opportunities. Are you a share holder because Im started to get fed up. Nearly every EV stock is popping and HYLN is down AH..
True.
I'm gonna fomo tomorrow
Life lesson, don't sell LEAPS, they're LEAPS FOR A REASON!
Yea I mean sorry to puncture the wound more but thats literally step 1 of investing. Dont panic sell unless its something like luckin coffee lmfao.
dude its not that simple. hindsight is 2020 but for all we know nio couldve went back down to 20 if you held. its not so much about being patient but more about increasing your risk tolerance.
not as bad as you but i pulled all my stock out of NIO last week and now its at 52,  shouldve definitely held bro dam, but i am also autist and  that is a long fucking leap call haha
NIO 80c 2/19/21 free money bro

No, fake news.  Just said Biden gets the legally required funding for training a transition team.  Hes still fighting in courts.

Are you allowed to buy it back immediately? I did too, that's why I ask.
Thats so yesterday. 

THCB is the new kid on the block.
Good times ahead for fcel though
Who wants to miss out on a 50% day tho
The chance of it popping tomorrow is extremely low, so you gucci
You cry for a Green Day but you like to give out your cock. That is a mixed signal from a 
PLTR
Chinese ev REITs?
Fuck ya
I have a slightly smaller position as well
Even with Elon around, they are leaders in what they doo..specialists will always be needed. Market has plenty of room for different players..
Who cares what they do if you get to double your money then cash out the moment it happens.

Buy the opportunity, sell the result, don't take any interest in the move beyond that. If you don't think it'll go anywhere that's not an unreasonable assessment. But if you believe the story that THCB will double soon none of that matters. Double up, get out, ignore THCB rest of life.
competition is healthy
THCB is working on a different battery chemistry - specifically the seperator. I'm not sure tesla doing any research in that space. Tesla is definitely king in the packs, cells, and system design.
I thought THCB was a weed spac?
just looked up their holdings, I think MOON is as close to a WSB ETF as possible lmao.

NIO
SPCE
PLUG

has some other garbage in it but all it needs is PTON and PLTR for the full house
A boomer doomer
God damnit I'm holding puts
why would it tho
Wait yah why ?

Market is on easy mode
100%. Markets should pump at least until the end end of the year.

Anything remotely related to EV will moon. EV is the new shitcoin.

yolo 10k on CLNE calls. You won't regret.
THCBW\* because you could control like 6000 shares and once its above 11.5 you'd make $6000 per dollar THCB is above 11.5. And it expires in 5 years. PRINTER if ya ask me

Convert that cash into THCB shares and then the shares to even more cash
Just show them the white dog that shits on each side of the yard. At least that's how I pick my stocks
I have USPS updates where they send me the mail expected for the day - today was a letter for the IRS. Was so scared, until I saw it was only to notify me my student loan lender accessed my records for the income based plan.

we hit "extreme greed" on the fear/greed thingy.
Dude were all either gonna be buying each other Teslas or be back to the grindstone by EOY
Yup. I made wayyyy too much money today to think tomorrow wont take it all back. I locked in most of my big gains at closing. Still holding a couple risky plays over night, but those already popped AH and I think will continue into open.
You an infidel
Did you getting in on THCB? Rocket started boarding today, liftoff soon

A lot of busses are electric nowadays. And everyone here takes the short bus
Can confirm, own TSLA shares and calls, never even sat in one yet
Loser didnt even outperform Obamas market.

Gotta think it's CRSR most underrated but still agree this shit will blow big.
If PLTR hits 250 EOY Ill buy you a BJ
What roller coaster?! EV just went 
or just wallowing in your own filth eating old potatoes in your apartment which lack the basic amenities we take for granted. Capitalism is keeping us all fat

Pltr 12/18 20c
Why would you do that tho then you can buy PLTR OR TSLA
I did today before close.
Bought 12/4 at close. No way Im holding something like EV overnight. Gains will be dissipated by the PM crowd.
Has it been 3000-something for 5 months? Not really what I'd throw into.
I sold mine at 44 so I scroll past really fast lol. Can't be mad I picked up some CIIC which has more room to run when merger is finalized. 50% day today!
sold half my shares when it was at $34 when i bought in at $24.  goddamit.
I will take you up on that offer

Please give free money here
Remind me! 1 day
Can I get my 1000 in NIO shares?

free money please
I'm in
I almost bought those calls myself.
Helloooo
Tariffs would price them out. Not to mention patent laws. Everything they make that isnt basic manufacturing is stolen tech.
2021 it goes to Europe....so soon?
Ok this one made me chuckle
I did the same thing with my 50cs
Its FSR now pal
Because it's for boomers
If CIIC had options it would have broken WSB.
Their artist is much better. Should go $180
She is a sturdy steward of the market and a total beauty!!
read between the lines, she is a "dove", so she won't increase interest rate.
might be that this eliminates Warren from contention, who would be very bearish big tech.
Old school dove, only reason Trump hated her was the vajeje
Rofl... How old are you?
2) Selling xpev too early
How about either buying puts or even worse, shorting those guys?
I  pussied out of buying xpev when it was at 20 smh.
Try CRSR
That's an insult to shit stains
im actually up on it and still feel this way
BLNK trying to form a middle finger to citron
I sold when they were at +38% today trying to do the responsible thing and take my profits... my goodness
Apple game weak
This THCB pump is ridicolous
We are the 1% now
STOCK MOE DA GOD
Imagine if he bought calls!!!
$73+ in AH!!!! OH GOD!!
In the long term it should be perfectly fine. In the short term, idk but try not to fomo into things unless you expect to lose money alrdy
According to the autists in this sub, cant go tits up if you are holding for a year especially.
Put in csp for 20p 11/27 .73 cr or 21p 11/27 1.13 cr
Just buy a yolo FD or two when you see a sell-off start and try to stop loss early if you really can't stomach it.

Its bound to come back down, I diamond handed ACB puts and made out with 100% gain
I bought a 60p 12/4.... at this point its worthless so might as well hold for the dip :P It has to happen at some point, some kind of profit taking
Unlimited Energy man
What does that mean?
All in
All of them
Full position. 8% of your portfolio and dont look except once a month
As many as fucking possible

TSLA 600 by 12/21
TSLA has some battery explosion issues for asshats that drive their sports car 100 MPH into a tree. I'll pass.
Doesnt arkk have a lot of tsla? If it really is a bubble you may not be reducing your risk much.

FWIW I think thats a great idea, just devils advocate
Never a bad idea to take profits from a short term trade and put it into a long term investment. Especially from a hot sector into a cold sector.
Normally I would say this is a go, but I would tread carefully here given the fight that is about to happen for control of all their funds
[deleted]
THCBW is the ticker for warrants, closest you can get to options for THCB
Its a SPAC no options yet
How likely is that tho
Yes but it really is 50/50 cases are getting up there , but vaccine news and possibly another stimulus check... or another lockdown could happen and a lot of people lose their jobs.
Safe to say lot of better plays out there if you are willing to play spacs.  Only downside no options
Profit is profit
Big time, Ill fuck anything
In a heartbeat

Story checks out
Everyone knows how much tsla was being held back by GSA
Sold BLNK 1/15 17.5 Cs for $700.... they are worth $20+ now D:
A lot of combos to win man, sold my jan  2021 55c calls for a profit, this monday raly was unexpected but, i think everything ev is riding from tsla hype.
XPEV and $100 by EOW
i think you mean by 2022. By 2021 implies it will be 100 in 40 days
Did you buy 2min before AH? Shit mooned over 50%
Nope headed to $20
I've sold and fomoed back in 3 times this past week and made 600% each time. Bought back in at the evening dip and was up 15% at close and is now up 15% after hours lmao. This fucker doesn't quit.
Whats thcb merging w
HCAC son roll both gains into HCAC
I did today. CIIC price is valuing a pretty ridiculous evaluation for ARRIVAL. 20B at this point? I'd take my chances with THCB
you can buy puts, just on ZM and vxx/vix/etc
Stop I can only get so erect
That's only 20 above where we are right now, we hitting 560+ homeboy
Whats the news?
Tsla calls
TSLA called?
Green jacket. Gold jacked. Who gives a shit.
Reee georgia elections in January. Hold your bets
Wouldn't bet on red senate. Georgia runoffs might be easily blue

What about apple Juice?
Git gud

E; in all seriousness work hard, don't live beyond your means, and gradually save up. Have a budget for every paycheck (it can include fun stuff but net +ve to savings and net -ve to debts if at all possible always). Don't skimp on experiences, but don't mortgage your future for any either.
Probably tech and EV, it wouldnt be dumb to follow the market. PC answer: whatever your little heart desires friend.
lmao dont even act like ur gonna hold til EOY
look at CIIC :)
THCB wont have any significant movement until the formal DA comes (looking like a promising deal though). I mean its a fine play, but its more of a long term one. PLTR is a rocket going into orbit as we speak so is a better short term move (long term is amazing as well though). THCB is on the launch pad for a launch date a few weeks/months down the road (in my opinion).
Naw bro you gotta hold both of it. PLTR is the deal
Pola
Look at CIIC and especially SBE
if not we only loose \~1.10 lol
can tell me how warrants works?
Its pumped it 4% after hours so at least Ill get those gains
letssfuckkinngggoooo. Enjoy the J
I have 1/15/21 $9 lottery calls and I cant believe theres even a chance.

DD or its fake
It better, I have a 368c and I was mad disappointed today, but PLTR came In clutch with the 115 profit
CRSRs been one of the safest guaranteed moon stocks in years and my dumbass bought shares.
Kind of. Still have legal battles that arent over but will instruct staff to aid in transition more or less
This is how meme stocks are forged. Hype that fucker until wall street notices, they FOMO in, and we ride the wave
British here. Wouldnt touch the FTSE with a turkey twizzler.
Oh shit nice.
I will do as soon as I recovered from my losses
Same except i just blindly bought apple calls cause I believed in them. I dont believe in them anymore :(....but hope they pump tomorrow so i can break even...hell if i profit id be ecstatic. Already symbolically burned that money in my mind.
I have half my 401k in XOM, I got in a few weeks ago at $33. It should be trading around $50. 

Im also balls deep in WFC, I got in at $22. It has the financials to support $40/share. Im also holding a 35/50 spread Jan 2022 Expiry. If it hits $40 itll be a 3-4 bagger.
Ahaha
and still flying AH
Wife her up for that streamer dough

Pretty fucking happy

bro try sucking a cock and making it cum 

U have a better chance of making money off that way than puts
Same here. But this time I believe we're onto something. Hang in there fellow gey ber
Ur a literal cuck if u pull out and just watch it keep mooning
its been mooning for two weeks straight, itll probably keep going.
Holding my $16 2/19 calls man  Ill go down with the ship.
why would anyone pull out
sold my calls and got some shares. We in for the long run
My closest expiry is February and those are up 1150%. I wanna see 2000%.
Asked myself the same thing but its not peaked yet. Its not being pumped on Twitter as much as nio is so Ill wait until the non Reddit pump and dump crowd start talking about pltr before I sell my options
Literally pltr. I was going to go in last Friday. Went up 200%. Why am I such a pussy
THCB
Me too
THBC
Whoever brought CRSR up in one of the daily threads at the end of the week is my hero
Wow. Id say you probably owe him a beer but sounds like hes doing just fine...
He's in GME now, join us!
any idea what price that will be?
I cant wait!
Stfu pussy and buy the dip!
What beta university asking for donation 

What sorry as school u go to 

What USLESS ass degree they gave u bro
RH didn't update it. It used to aim to merge with a weed company. Now EV.
It originally was meant to acquire a cannabis company. Now its going to acquire a battery company
Considering there is literally a thc-b lol I thought the same thing for a while
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I heard the mens buttholes are wetter
I sold CIIC for THCB today
I went short on CRSR today but reinvested. It hit 46 even after hours lol, hold til fucking heat death of the universe unless you know something I dont
Literally the point. He didnt want the looming threat of a non peaceful transition to fuck with the market while hes in control
Fake news
?
Whats he Biden news?
What news? 650c 1/15
I'm considering it too. At this point a pullback is not looking too likely
I thought for sure I hit the peak today when I bought by shorts around 54.5 but sure enough its still up after hours  I don't think people are asking themselves if a company that sold 10k cars/yr should be valued at over 1/3 of Toyota thats sells 10 million but instead just see "Chinese Tesla" and click buttons. There's gotta be a pullback, but who the fuck knows when my puts expire Friday so im probably fucked but oh well
I can wait 
Long term it will pay off
Same. Dumped a 4k weekend profit into some random spacs people here made me fomo into. We'll see how it goes.
A
THCB
Wait for me
Youre***
PLTR is gonna hit 100$ and so on in down the line

get in now before it hits 30 or 40
get in now bro $24 tomorr
Ima be honest man I went in at $18 thinking that was wrong and I should waited on a dip. Im normally always the dude buying dips as a way in.... idk if the dip is gonna happen man, maybe FOMO in? But I dont want to be the one saying to do it then you get fucked. I do believe it still has a ton of upside ahead by EOY if your willing to hold for time.
sell puts
Buy it?
I asked this same question when it was 15.8 last week... there might be some pull back in the near term but no way this isn't over 30 a year from now. The government amd big tech loves companies that make their spying more efficient so pltr is set for Mars
Dip at 19
Why would it be too late if you believe in their model
Buy 100 shares, then sell calls on it

Edit: calls not puts
$10c 1/23

They were $12 per on Friday, been saying people should buy them for long term play (its a discount method play a 1 for 1 move in the stock).

That said, maybe $15 calls now instead due to the run up.

Or just shares (I know boring).
4.5% now
Where are you seeing this?
Source?
Bought a bad bitch ! We ride to the moon tomorrow
Yeah, if Biden wants to do a big Infrastructure bill, there's going to have to be more of an available labor pool coming up. I'm thinking they might let unemployment get back to like 9% so that process is smoother.

Much of what Democrats want to do requires a worse economy, so it wouldn't surprise me if they let things cool off a lot.
Don't put more than 5% or 10% of your portfolio in it but shit I am a total Boomer investor and even I don't worry too much about gold volatility.  Really is less of roller coaster ride than stonks.  Then again I plan on holding it for 20+ years so.
Probably, but Id rather put my money into something better. I dont know how mine are in the red still when I have 22c expiring in april
Lol, chef
Now
Penny stocks are like a step above sports gambling. Options could give you better potential returns with less risk than penny stocks
At about three fiddy
Post an insane dd on the front page and I'll follow you to valhalla
whats the price target for tomorrow realistically
That one guy told me to buy Tesla calls so I did. He didn't tell me how long to hold tho! I sold for 100% profit. Why do I feel bad it's up another 20$ atm?
Yes all in baby
I've been into this drink that has lion's mane called [Koios](https://koiosbeveragecorp.com/). It has some caffeine, but I swear it's doing more than just coffee and it tastes great. It's like a carbonated soda but it has MCT oil, Ginseng, L-Theanine, L-Tyrosine, Choline, massive amounts of B vitamins and Lion's Mane. I don't want to sound like an infomercial but they're actually having a big sale right now!
Why am I the only one that theanine doesn't work for
Where do you order it from?
What brand? I need some of that shit.
Moda
Yea that shit is the best
Meth.  Really helps my focus.
Oh what?
Smells like PLTR.
You bought?
I bought at the top today and almost sold at a loss, thank god I didnt
Yessir shits going to the moon
Everytime I see it i laugh
Would you look at it! Just look at it!
Tesla shorts are the ones receiving things right now if you know what I mean.
I haven't even gotten my fucking Tesla Tequila yet. I was going to pop it open on the second day of S&P inclusion. Fuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Getting sewn together by Laosian children. Give them a break.
Elon telling you only retards short Tesla
Loading up on TSLA puts tomorrow
Much sad my hood of robin seems to be drained of her sweet tendie nectar everyday. At the hands of the commies. No Yuan, no dollars, no tendies .... China has taken away my life
Same have half my portfolio sitting in baba and watching stocks I had call exp on last week moon :/
If you got money for snap, why not go into ev
Love how nobody here trades SPY or AAPL or AMD anymore.. it's just garbage "cLeAn EnErGy" stocks... that's how you can tell there are no long term users here.. it's just one batch of retards to the next. The users come and go as the flavor of the month does..
Tbh as long as you arent being literally braindead by playing options on these EV meme stocks you will be fine when the rug is inevitably pulled. Just set a half decent stop loss
as many as it takes for me to close my puts
Depends. FAANG is oversold so next rotation is probably IWM, EV's and recovery stocks back into big tech and stay at home. I think it happens this week
Idk but are you in THCB
Lol you aint kidding. I bought a bunch of THCB after that DD today. Its a solid play.
lol bruh
Thats not a thing already? Lmao it seems so obvious though
Both havent even gotten started
Are you going to do a post on MARA?
Calls?
This is American way
Easy to lose it that easy too
what were your positions
Bro I feel this so hard
Tomorrow is another chance to fly
Buy in. This thingll be $35+ by March of my name isnt Alexander C. Karp
ICLN gang going to gain .25-.50 every day till the end of time
you are welcome retard
KNDI made me stupid gains today. Their total stock worth is up 30% today.
Just heard about this then. Strikes and dates???
Its a blank check company merger with a EV battery maker based in Texas. See DD : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzkpv1/i_made_the_dd_on_ciic_last_week_now_i_am_moving/
When is it going up
yep, some people are in denial, gotta ride waves cuz
looks like hes already strapped in with a one way ticket to tendaritaville
lol damn going to be rich eoy
Go dad. 3000 shares is a lot.
Thank you Mr. Rodgers!
TLDR: All in NIO expiring Friday
THCB army rise up. Bring out your THC and CBD and get lit.
yep. I sold some BLNK 12/24 $17.50 puts for that juicy IV premium. don't expect it to go much lower than $15 even if it crashes. the last few run ups it had it didn't crash much below 50%. so this high of $35 is looking good for me.
But today I am EUPHORIC
Why stop there
How do you price in an EV revolution? Its like trying to price Ford in 1903
holy hell!

Edit: no wonder it's going off, between insiders and institutions, the float is 97.67% tied up.
Pump and Pump
4.8 percent is slow
True story
As certain as Bloomberg is
It has been written
That be the kiss of death
which there are a few

I had a bunch of shares at 76 cents when it was just a little baby penny stock. I am not ok.
HCAC next runner 
We dont bust back cuz we shoot first
NO SHIT SHERLOCK (about the part where you said no one in this sub knows what they are talking about).

Nah. Man. We told you  doing this is good for the market cuz every transition news gonna pop.
Using TSLA as a metric to test over/under valued... never change WSB
"they're overvalued" = "I can't afford them"
Bruh tsla has multiple factories
You're shitting me.  Did he really?

When you don't show up for court they issue a warrant.

They are basically an option that you can't exercise until a specific date.

Dude congrats on breaking even. I got IV crushed and just got back to break even from last week. Waiting for a dip and will reposition.
I saw the potential when it was at like $10-15/share, but almost +200% in a week at nearly $40/ share when literally the only reason is the surrounding EV hype... Come on. 

I say that as someone still holding shares..
Because it keeps going up
Actual DD right here not getting any love.
Same here, and everybody else is making money with ChEV/EV plays
I regret selling at $46 on Friday but now I'm realizing that stocks only go up and reality is just a simulation.
I sold half and I still hope it doesn't
I lost that much, tax deduction bich!
I bought 11/25 spy puts. Right there with ya

you have more to give
Start pickin out your lambo
i like what i'm seein
Where do you see this shit I cant see it on my app
Wish I did the same. Cashed out on the first sign of a dip at 10k profit. Left 5k on the table at the current AH price.
When did you get in?

Im sick. Sold by 35c 12/18 on Friday...
My 40c are going to be flying tomorrow.

Yeah been running hot.  I like to pretend its because Im becoming a better trader but really its just meme stocks and the whole market rising
It's been a while.  I had a bunch of really small loss days but my chart doesn't show any drops since the 11th
Story of that shit stocks life. 

Boomer to the max
Yeah feels like he gon fuck shit up before he leave
This market is beyond retarded. We are not escaping this range lol.
I went for RIOT on Thursday and now that I'm looking at MARA's website I'm definitely buying calls here too. Miners in that space are going to make a disgusting amount of money and these production levels are serious.

Check out my DD. $347K YOLO.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzioed/mega_dd_bangbus_ev_going_public_everything_you/
THCB only because that's what everyone else is saying
For sure HCAC. Hasnt run yet and has CIIC potential
THCB and some in THCBW
Website of that company isn't exactly confidence inspiring to be honest: microvast.com

But what does it matter if you can take a turd, put two wires in it and call it a revolutionary EV battery and people will eat that shit
I sold my 7c last week for a loss
I think it will hit 20 around mid December when people remember they want to do holiday shopping. Positive GME catalysts are vaccine (like for every other stock) and stimulus (if it happens) because what else are people going to spend money on this holiday season. Consoles are the headline item for most families/people.
get on in for that  ~infinite squeeze~  my guy
Always has been  
Love baba, hopefully we see gains.

Its not. And it wont. Rip your calls and bags
One less factor of uncertainty.
Trillions

This is insane...I seriously thought wed get to $20 by EOW at the earliest
Yes doctor, the balls on this one
Me too lmfao...
I love how people buy stuff that ran up all day EOD and hold overnight. 
Right there with you!
Its pretty insane considering I thouht this was gonna be a slow run up based on last weeks activity
I sold 3/9 contracts today fuck
The call Gods needed a sacrifice. You will be rewarded.

dont be too hard on yourself dude.
It's hard to balance. You don't want to be too cocky because that's how you lose it all.
That dip on SBE hit my stop limit and now I'm sad. Oh well. On to the next one.
Lol Jesus Christ
If you would have just sold for a loss today and transferred to EV

Usually if the merger is successful yes they just turn into one company so you own shares of the merged company, basically the SPAC disappears as it was just used as a blank check company
Nice my dude!
AYRO to finish it out
I love how this comment sums up we are realistically at the top of the bubble but fuck if I dont have half those too. CIIC is your play tho sir

watched all day but didn't pull the trigger, I think "there's something going on"... metals in a 4-month downtrend
If it hits 22

You will always lose thinking like this fucktard stop trying to time the top
Thousands of conservatives out there saying "biDeN oWnED by CHYNA" but taking in the EV gains
the bear market
The reason it's not crashing is because Biden has 0 power. They lost house seats and didn't gain the senate. Historically unprecedented, this means Trumps tax cuts are priced in for 2 or even 4 years. They cannot be removed. The crash was going to be biden implementing socialist policies like crazy high taxes and removing trump tax cuts. For all intents and purposes, trump's policies will still be president for 4 more years while biden sits in his chair doing absolutely nothing.

Which expiration and strike? Also wait for pullback?
Why is there fuss about GME? What's the justification for buying into their business model? 

 - Brick and mortar stores have been in a giant downturn. 

- The entire gaming industry is at risk of "going virtual". GeForce, Xbox games bought for online download, steam, etc. 

- Even back in 2015 when I bought an Xbox 1, I got it from best buy. My brother got his from Amazon. 

Like, I understand there are a few minor moved happening, but it doesn't necessarily justify going against a complete trend away from them.
Aka salty gaybears
I just looked and acb was over a 100 back then.  Yikes
Read the balance sheets on pot stocks vs EV bud. Apples and oranges. Not denying its a bubble but if youre assuming the pop will be to the same magnitude.. well you can do the math

Jacked to the tits bro. Its like youre earning extra life-time AND get paid.
Biden = 4 years of green energy/ green emissions
it is but who the fuck knows how long it will last. Probably until majority thinks "holy shit, I was wrong, it wasn't a bubble after all"
Oh we're totes in a bubble.   Xpeng is like top 10 auto maker or something now by market cap lol.  It makes like 20k cars per year.  I mean growth is good but 300% months in stock price is totes legit
It may be. If you bought in early, set a stop loss of 30% or whatever you deem right and you'll still have profited. Some of these EV's are probably just catching the wave but some of them will be genuine good long terms. You gotta do a DD on each one for a best understanding
Your friend is safe!
Just make money. That's all that matters.
Nah, it's the market catching up to where EVs are already positioned.
Thanks for your service
u r
I too am a gay-man-bear-clown.
I took gains on a few things. Lets me feel the euphoria of a bunch of picks continuing to go up 70 -150% without having to fear the crash.
Yeah I mean you're right. Euphoric bullshit like this can go on for longer than it should, but make sure you get something out of this. Someone has to hold the bags at the end
Nah thats gay. More like Sept 1st

Lol "fairly priced stocks" dude.. it's an ETF.. meaning if all of the ones it holds are apparently overvalued (they all are) then the entire sector as a whole is overvalued.

Ahh so that's what they do.  I'm already in for commons and warrants
This is still cheap folks. Get in.

On Friday: put in everything you have

If youre asking all of us collectively, then yes.
no, no dude, floor at 10.22
Just get in early enough to have low risk due to the shares being worth a cash value outside the market.
Sure, once algos get a hold of it, it will run.
I feel like FB is oversold, might be a good time to pick up long dated calls for cheap here

Bruh. At least you have a mortgage, implying that you are a homeowner. Half the kids in this sub live with their mom, or rents with 10 roommates in a 2 bedroom apt

Because its insured by the government and because gambling your emergency fund is retarded.  Better is getting a good enough job you can do both.

APHA imo
PLTR
I mean APHA hasnt even started but absolutely PLTR. 

AMC is garbage. AMC was a failing company and dying stock *before* Covid.
APHA is the best weed stock. But its a weed stock
Thats a tough one. 

My gut says APHA. But Ive been an APHA guy since 2015 so  

I see no reason APHA cant hit 15-20 by the end of 2021, if legalization goes through.
I'm ded
Fucking killer. Firing on all cylinders now!
I'm fucking high right now

Stick to long term options. The short ones are enticing but theyll clean you out if youre wrong.
Warrants will catch up eventually.
I have this down to buy ATM for March. You think thats the play? Are you long?
probably not man, up 200% i dont think these kinds of runs just stop, SBE and FCEL are good too
Im on the same boat. Missed out on this but it doesnt look like its stopping so i might buy in at open tomorrow
Shit tier EV charger but fomo is really real. Play calls at your own risk

Like DPW today?

Most days they're worth $10 a piece. $7 today.
I did down $5500
Down $500
Somehow I did...
ZROZ tried to but ARK carried me over the finish line.  QQQ was no help at all.
I sold my DPW shares at open for a 60% gain, could have had 200% if I held all day.  But for all I expected it to drop.

I didnt eveneave it on my watchlist.  I wish I had so I could have bought some more. And rode the pump from 100% to 200%
Big yikes
AZN calls but for once held through instead of paper handing and they're back in the money! I am so proud of myself, my losses have finally taught me something.

False. Traded them for the Hummer EV debut. Rear view
GM has been mooning every week. Benefits from vax pumps and EV mania.
Tiny ass EVs that cost like $2500. 

And they aren't overlooked they are up 30% since the COVID crash. Their stock was up 1% to that point since they came out of bankruptcy in 2010.
zm bad stonk imo

For bulls 
Me too. Thinking about taking my earnings and playing EV stocks
Maybe insurance company plays
KMI
Calls on hank hill
Ooh

EV
Of those two - airlines. Cruises are 100% consumer play. Airlines have business travel and freight to help out
Airlines. Cruise takers highly correlated with anti-mask/vax.
All guys cruise lines. Definitely
Both on the precipice of bankruptcy- I guess they could go the way of hertz
Cocaine lines
If you want to open any positions with airlines, Id highly suggest ALK.
BA
Im a ba perma bull  long term but its gonna drop again. It spiked to fast
Pretty straight forward: if you anticipate more airlines purchasing 737 MAX, buy calls. Otherwise, buy puts
What about more than once?
Haha wow well said

If SPY opens at 2%+ Im closing my calls at open. Remember that pump after the Pfizer news? It was up 3.75% and I was also up big, decided to ride it because MAYBE itll hit 4+. Then it dropped like a rock at the end. Not making that mistake again.

It's not COVID that harms the markets. It's lockdowns and uncertainty. 

The lockdowns right now are token and not really harming anybody with power. And with interest rates being low, the Dow should really be at like 35,000+ right now. So shit is going to run.

Every couple of years its the same. In 08, the housing bubble! During the trump era it was trade war panic! And now, covid.

You mean that Biden is behind all these electric vehicle companies and their profits, behind all these states and their electric vehicle and environmental goals, as well as all these world leaders promising insane electric vehicle quotas, emission standards, and carbon neutral initiatives by 2030 are all BIDEN?

Flying cars with wings
Check out reviews of the xpeng p7.  Its actually pretty nice.

Hopefully hiding until after Dec 21.

Days mate. There is going to be big pull back within a week
some of these stocks like xpeng is growing at an insane rate, surely can't keep going for too long, or can it? :S
I agree there will be a big pull back this week and I plan to fucking load during it cause this shit seems to not be stopping however I am talking about real bubble bursting. If we look at the history this does look like a typical bubble not that I am gay bear however I am just scared to put in solid investments when I hear this ticking bomb and see how much it increased in short time. I guess no one really knows but this indeed happened for example with .com bubble and I just wonder how much more we can make before this becomes a thing as with months or even weeks to go we can make shitload. I guess majority of us never experienced a bubble on market hence we cannot recognize one.
No
So you can automate this shit with selenium and not even spend time yoloing.
Stimmy to the Xmas rescue...sometime in February.
I did buy nio 6 months ago and still want to buy nio 6 months ago
Along with some TSLA and NIO
Sure hope so since I just bought it
I'm buying tomorrow, had all my money tied up today, but got some buying power now
Cancer needs to cure BLNK at this point
Something about them implying that they had 15k charging stations when they really only had like 2k functioning.
This market gives no fucks. EVs will fly all the way to the sun and pass the moon.
Yeeee
I think its laggging the EV sector. BTFD at any point, no matter how small for a weekly expiring next week. Easy money for now
CIIC will moon youre gonna be rich
Tomorrow.
Stocks yes. Options prices don't change ah, though.
Yes
EV Clown car with no brakes.  Get the fuck in

What you witnessed today was pure meme power along with BLNK.
Who couldve seen that coming though tbh everyone was touting nio as the front runner from here on out
Why not yolo anything EV or reopening related?
rip
Exactly. I'm about to go through all my positions, to see which (Profitable!) ones to cut so I can put more in the even more profitable positions. Crazy.

I knew snap would come up two years ago but I was too poor at the time to take advantage of it. I think there's still money to be made there though.

Fuckin' thing looks like grandma.

Down on Disney puts that would have been good if it wasnt for this bull shit vaccine news that needs to stop.
Nope 

Its a blank check company merger with a EV battery maker based in Texas. See DD : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzkpv1/i_made_the_dd_on_ciic_last_week_now_i_am_moving/
No, THCB is not a weed SPAC. They originally intended to go in the Cannabis industry while being open to other options. At present, they've signed a letter of intent with Microvast, an EV battery company.
no its ev, ev battery to be precise
I picked up some $25p's 12/17 before the closing bell. This stock is so fucking stretched out it ain't even funny.

Dont even get me going. Sold 300 shares at $9 late October. Missed the entire run up. Guh
I bought 12.5c 1/15/21 for .84 and sold them for 2.75 on the 17th. They would now be worth over 2k a pop. Had 7 of them.

I panicked in at the end of the day without any research and honestly thinking I was about to be PLAYED. But now that I look into it it seems good. A holdings company thats going to be partnered with Microvast who makes awesome and cutting edge batteries for the EV Market... which is obviously going insane right now. With Biden sworn in Jan... this should only continue to be a market to run. MKT cap tells me this thing has the potential to double or even 10x
4 letters and just buy

Unconfirmed yet
Essentially, he gave a go ahead for transition protocols to start
He didnt concede. He just tweeted to that woman in charge of GSA to allow transition to happen by releasing the funds

Hold it
Do not sell
If youre up enough to take a screenshot
its cheap, so they think it has room to grow, and they think the 100 price will return. they dont know what a split is
It's weird how many people I see asking about ACB a few hours before market open in this thread.
down the road
I bought a 12/18 27.5 just because it felt weird not holding any canopy.  Little mad I didnt pick up some Tilray on Friday, however I am still pretty deep in APHA although my shares are possibly gone since I sold 7c for Friday.
Buy what..?
dude same ahha TP hands on NIO at 22s :( and KNDI at like 10s ahahha fuck

Yes. Go fcel
Bought 200 shares today and sold covered calls, pretty sure it drops to 18.50-19, slowly climbs back up, then dips again after share lockup ends (could dip hard, could barely dip). After that it's a slow grind up with spikes related to privacy legislation, wars and terrorism (foreign and domestic). PLTR 50 2022
It's not even started properly yet
its never too late, it could go to $1000 a share
No

I sold. Im gonna cry
Them and sbe cured rona virus
Apparently all cars are going electric 
I don't know but i bought a 35 1/15 call and the crazy gains make me feel like they will disappear by morning.
Honestly the way the market is rallying I cant see another stimulus. Even Biden doesnt care about people losing their homes.
Buy it and THCB, retire.
Can I get the word origin?  Can you use it in a sentence please? Neegas
What did you call me?
Gonna reach 40
I bought a last min call on this holy fuck
Definitely SBE
Sbe 

Blnk has resistance at $37 from 5 years ago. Also, $45 is a major psychological resistance, not much upside left
SBE has control of the charging network market and RD.
casually mooning 
Too late to get in tomorrow?
GSA was obliged to release funds to the transition team and the news interpreted it as an official statement on transition
you have arrived just in time to lose your entire account on one ill-advised FOMO. 

It is our way

civil war was priced in, it didnt happen
Too late to get in tomorrow morning?
bruh you seeing other ev spacs? thcb is relatively limp compared to the rest of the bubble. we'll see how it plays
i honestly want to know myself bro, shits crazy
Idk. Sold like a tardo for 1.8k when i couldve held for +10k when it hit around 32.
Theres nothing wrong with getting pegged. It is a somewhat popular link. But there are cheaper ways to do it 
LIL YATCHY PROPHECIES ARE ALWAYS TRUE
Im in the same boat lol
I have no idea. Stock is a freight train powering through everything

Oh you wana discuss spacs and their legitimacy? Cool. Lets talk more about SPACs.

Is the 5% increase worth the increase in job responsibility and duties? 

Sometimes taking a promotion or changing job roles might not be worth it if is going to be x% more difficult than your current position and the increase in your compensation is y% where x > y. Its only worth it if y > x. When I say compensation I mean it includes being in an union, your benefits, location of the job, etc. (Anything that the job adds or takes away from what you value).
No. Job security value in being union > 5% salary increase
No.not unless the job opens doors for growth in a few years that current job doesnt
Hell no. At least a 20% increase. But if its a temporary stepping stone to get yourself into a higher paying position, yes.
5% increase in pay, but 50% increase in workload/stress and at least 20% increase in hours that will be unpaid cuz salary
More than half lol

You can get warrants
I sold my ciic shares up 40% Friday that I bought on Tuesday. . If I held them Id be up over 100% today. I bought warrants at lunch today and Im up 40% on those. 40-100% gains on shares in less than a week might as well be options at this point.
Warrants my dude
Warrants are similar to options.

Well, Hyundai did make an investment into HCAC like it did with CIIC. In fact, Hyundai made the HCAC investment even after investing in CIIC. 
I trust the guy who brought us CIIC and he says THCB.

Isnt that the thing that bets on what the stock price will be at a certain date?
dont, the more i learned the more i lost, jus stick with greeks to learn risk management

BLNK is the most overbought garbage stock out there. Much better EV Plays... puts will print
if dickcoin breaks out tonight yeah maybe
I pray
I hope so , I picked up quite a few bags today.
Yes. Yes they are. Riot is going to have one hell of a 2021
How so?
RKT just has to announce they're getting into the electric rocket business. That or just add the letters EV to the end of their company name.
I gave up on RKT calls and have just been buying stocks, and averaging down. I know it's boring but who knows when the market will realize that this is a gold mine.
RKT is dogshit trash and i hate it even worse than ATVI now

FK
RKT was a retard play only found on WSB
BLNK was even in my buy tomorrow list and I forgot with all the other green shit going on
PLTR + CHINESE EV'S - Im all in - lose my house if it tanks.. Spent weeks on the sidelines - had enough. Went all in at close

Go to r/investing.

Were aiming for 1,000% here
Ya, just replace returns with losses
I always felt bad taking profit early while others got Out The Ass Tendies but sometimes you see the same people lose their gains on greedy plays as well.
YES FUCKING SIRRRRRR
Thx for tendies
Remember it can take a couple of week so have patience
People doubt this shit but like I just made 5k with a press of a button today just because I listened to your sexy ass. 

God bless 
Just did a $2k buy don't let me down
Merger with who
THICC B TO DA MOON WE GO

I traded options for weeks before i found out you could sell them for a gain lol
Not below $3000, not time to buy.
Yeah i rotated from PLTR to RIOT and MARA on friday, rotating amongst memes is great
u didnt take profit?
I feel you. I'm eyeing XPEV jealously, but I'm still happy to be making money. I'm really at a loss as to why XPEV is rocketing so hard though.
Literally so much lmao
When is that happening anyway
shhhhhhhh lol
Shoutout to that one guy 
Same!
Hopefully Biden makes a priority once inaugurated.
How are your puts doing
F.
Boomers too focused on DivErSiFICatIon and portfolio allocation principles. 

Plus, they dont understand SPACs, and anything new is scary.
what is the spac name?
name some that are near IPO price
also must have calls because shares must never be traded
Safe for another 90 years then, thats how this works right?
Rotation into THCB lol
THCB my dude

I drove by a testing place today in a pretty big city with testing all over the place. 2 hr line wrapped around the building and spilled out onto the main road. This thanksgiving will be a nationwide superspreader event and I think thats what pops the bubble. Crash happens two weeks after thanksgiving, maybe a week after that.
All signs point to yes. So no.
everything tanking in about 5 min
After hours tesla says no.
SPAC+EV=
Does it have an option chain?
All this pumpin makes me suspicious

Doesnt mean I didnt buy in tho
more so market doesnt like uncertainty, and trump was the one were it was uncertain if he was gonna cause anymore trouble
Obviously
We gon be fine, babay. Let the EV folks have their day. Ours will be here soon. The Biden news this evening will be good for us.
Will be just fine. President-elect wont let our calls expire worthless. 

ALSO, remember that BABA owns 19% stake in XPEV. 19%!!!
Yes, Mango is gone = good for chyna stocks
Pm was so promising. Then we flopped. It's gonna recover, just how long?

You're up 1000% and you're wondering if you should exit. Just.. Just.... It's cool buddy. Diamond hands.
When you take a screenshot for WSB
You do not provide enough details for anyone to tell provide you with an opinion. But take profits and roll it out if you still feel bullish
True diamond hands...I let go of that same call at 41.00 good shit
You forgot about calls you bought yesterday?
Im casually holding NIO calls up 2500% AMA
yes
Yes
Sell
Yeah dont do that
Yes. PFE will never hit 45
May be, that will dump for good news as well.
Deeply. Dont do it. Look at AZN. Raised the market and went red. Ive played PFE for a long time. Its boomer garbage for options. 

Tomorrow will be green all over. Lots of good plays.
Try turning it off and then on again

" Good economy means good stock market.
yes
Check it out AH
Yep. Until its not. Janko was like that for weeks. You could buy a call any time during that period and it would pay by eod. Finally some autist on here mentioned it and it died a violent death.
Probably. I hate the fucking company and am bearish on it long term but it's cool seeing people make bank here on it. I was admittedly wrong about it in the short term!

Yes 
I was gonna go for LGVW this morning but it dropped straight after opening, then I got introduced to beautiful THCB. In with 500 shares
I just want to load up on more leaps, so I do kinda hope it dips a bit.
It will just hang on
I bought a bunch of it when it was sitting under 3
12/18 8c right here
All im reading is that they RKT making more money off these guys than normal companies would. Bullish
Form my calculations...alot
Im hoping for another 5-10% up tomorrow
Yes
U got time sir
Nah should recover
I've calls. Do what you want with that information
Put tomorrow, call after that
Same company, ticker just happens to be CIIC
I'm pretty sure randomly doubling down after a dip isn't actually DCA but that's okay
Two of them are EV companies w real products and sales that are very hard to duplicate or manufacture.

One is a coffee company that can be duplicated by anyone with $50k 

Just saying.
No fraud here.
Because its not an EV stock
It has spent the better part of 2020 shitting the bed. How long have these targets been out there?
It says one analyst  gave it a price target. Who is the analyst? Is there a merger underway here?
Because thats in fucking Chinese dollars. Try dividing by like 9 and thats the real price target.
Zoom out. Also thats 1 analysts target

Edit: but by all means please do and come back in 90 days.
New China!
Yeah man just follow citron and see how much money they lost

Unfortunate. I am using my s-loan. 1000 shares PLTR but unfortunately also have 1000 shares of RKT.
i am just too pissed i missed out on when i owned at $7
i missed it cuz i blinked
I had up to $26k in there since last Thursday, but was too much a wiener to buy calls... would be rolling in it 
Its going to run with Roku. If Roku keeps mooning so will fubo.

Sell and if youre confident use profit to buy another
Good luck...
So how we open that play .

now were at 20%+ 
Stock cured cancer
even after getting called out for $0 in R&D.... hahaha
Seriously. Wtf is going on
Tesla? Lmao why didnt you buy more NIO at $3 in March?
More lockdowns and cases? Idk
Ya I think it got a target price of 300 recently
Get THCB instead bruh
Still a good buy
Sure its only ran up 2,700% this year, surely it will work out just fine
No one knows. Id wait for a dip but has not been dipping lately....
What's going on with hcac? Intrigued and might by December calls
I got in apxt today too sat flat but not a lot of people know about it yet, it should rip when word gets out.
In on this.... wish I bought more lol.
How? It doesnt smell shit
Oil still down 40-50% from pre-COVID valuation.
I believe the term could / should be getting it's chiclets rattled?
You missed that in 2017.

Roll out
Profit is profit and you should be happy
I closed all my my 11/27 calls  when it broke 20 profit is profit
Got a link?
Its not a normal market right now. Make money while you can but only gamble what you can afford to lose (i.e. not retirement money)
They might if you invested real money
No, just throw the money into Mercadolibre or shit JMIA. Those stocks never go down for some reason. I shouldve putted amazon instead of fucking Mercadolibre last week.
Fuck amzn. Buy EV
We r fuk
I wouldn't be so sure.. PLTR has a huge runway. Its really hard for other companies to get the type of government contracts they do. The vetting process alone is ridiculous, they should be relatively unchallanged and have a huge head start.
Many, many people are buying Palantir man. 35 EOY.
Everyone is gonna downvote me, but the actual answer is *likely* that it's pure retail euphoria, and it's being pushed along by big funds. This is a pretty common occurrence. When retail starts inflating a stock, the funds will fuel the fire to get more buy-in. Then, one day, they offload and pull the rug.

We've literally seen it happen to like 100 WSB meme stocks, yet somehow people here refuse to believe it's possible every single time.

Ride the wave, but take profits. Because you never know when you'll wake up one day and it'll be down 40% overnight.
Hold em
Hold
Lol youll be itm by EOW
Hahaha cant be mad at that, especially with JMIAs price action. Thing could plummet to $17 in a day.
While I sit here looking at my CC's I sold at -800%. lol
Shhhh. Next Netflix. Going to 45
Shhhh... Next ROKU but with DKNG...  Shhh... Going to $45
That would be amazing
I bought my calls on Monday when it was $11.50. LETS FUCKING GOOO
stfu this is ev land now
230 is all Im asking
Thats a big stretch my guy
Im gonna throw up how come know one told me

Ooof high of 7.00 today. What did you sell at?
Any a hole could of told u ostk was 70 inbound
There are no options available yet
Unironically  THCB
Literally any EV stock apparently.
Nothing is free. Accept apparently China EVs
I mean Im at 124% on PLTR options

*Edit: my capital was/is limited so I dont have many contracts
Don't worry, you'll get to again in 2020
Wont look as cool or funny in memes
Yeah. Thinking people were seriously liquidating their Apple shares to FOMO into meme stocks
Who cares if its ev it's worth 800 times as much
Guessing youre also holding the bag on $AAPL? This thing has been due for a move for 2 weeks now!
Nobody realizes tendies
car parts, finished buying everything on my list a few months ago so I really haven't been spending any tenders since. best just to keep building on gains i think. easier with more money in the folio
I realize that I never have any tendies
Throw them in the market again
any realized profits I see get sunk in RKT leaps and disappear
Is there news or is it just a rocket ship?
Seeing that. Looks good, as does a continued run on ol' PLTR despite it's current pace!
I'd like to exit at 30, will play by ear
May not get there next week, may have to hold a little longer but I'll be pulling some out around 20 and then let the rest ride.


Learned my lesson when I sold ciic at 17 and didn't hold a portion of it to get the next 9 point run up

They are priced to perfection for sure, but the IV will be insane and you will get fucked more than likely.
Im in 
Thats when you profit off the dip


COP
Bought most of my tech calls just before the Sept dip and sold everything at a 50%+ loss a couple weeks ago. Joined onto this EV train and never looked back.

It might pop again who knows  just make a decision and stick with it

I bought 230 calls 9 weeks out when Microsoft was a 226 and just rode it to 0

Puts, or take some profits
Hedge with puts on ETFs or diversify and buy other sectors
Set up a TrailStopLimit order. It will automatically sell if the price drops a set amount from whatever high it gets to. 

For example, I make one for my XPEV, (it's only good for a day, so you have to re-do it every day), that will sell if it drops 5% off of the highest price. So if it goes up to 100, then the order will kick in if it later drops to 95. If it goes up to 200, the order kicks in if it later drops to 190.
We'll see 1,000 eventually, this week though I'm thinking more like 600
Nope, its a boomer stonk now, lots of ev stonks our there
I think theres a blink correction coming. Multiple analysts gave them a price target of 5 to 8 dollars a share
I wouldn't put too much in at this point, the runup has been way too high recently. I don't doubt though that it still has some more room to run.

Not sure.  

Volume is going to be so light this week, I have the feeling that we can see pretty frothy buying tomorrow and Wednesday.
I pulled out at 17.53 
why bro, ur wild lol, floor for CIIC way further than floor for thcb
CIIC (Arrival) is the first EV company that I actually plan on holding for a long time.
Rivian sold out of their launch R1T and R1S.  In a few days (cheapest version of each is $70K).  

Rivian is going to be a juggernaut.
Are they actually pumping CIIC??
That's what I said about NIO and XPEV
If its digital radio, theyre just personalizing the ads cuz they know youre autistic.
Sold my calls today at 200%, want to get back in
Holding warrants since $1.00.  Ive been selling slowly on the way up, still have 1/2 my position. This could keep running farther and farther, but locking in some gains is always a good idea.
Ideally go for April calls, doesnt matter what strike. I have January 30c and shares
Wherever the million dollar man says so.
20c 15/1 over here. Bit optimistic
Group meeting?

12/4 3400 here. Bought at the low today.
i wonder
THCB, HCAC, NBAC?
brack friday bundaroo
Lol I have some $2.5 calls. Can't wait to see this shit at open
I put 90k into shares and I only have 49k. Im dead certain too
I am cheering for it to go down to ~110 good luck!
I just bought $113 calls
Such as? Seriously considering if i need to jump back in or not after shares were called away a couple weeks ago
Same its make or break for me tomorrow
Or it's the start of a slow downtrend in the overall market
ETF? You 65?
Great call. I bought 10 ICLN contracts back in early September that are up over 200%. Wish I had split with QCLN to get EV exposure.
Trump is poorer than you if he pays all his debt. Still they call him a billionaire

Biden cabinet picks are bullish, Michigan certified him, presidential transition given green light by GSA = Stability
You better be nice to these retards. 

1) If there werent any retards, who would be on the other side of the trade that prints tendies?

2) If there werent any retards, where will you get your daily entertainment from?

Why when they can make it proprietary and charge a fortune in the aftermarket for car specific chargers. No doubt there will be a "standard" but look at the smartphone/PC peripheral market to see how successful that has been.

PLTR is up like .40 cents after hours...its an insane run this week
Nah dawg. Its literally runnin on retard strength. Jump back tomorrow before it lifts off

Gonna be lit
My strategy has been to diversify in meme stocks, I buy some shares of every meme stock I see talked about on this sub. Going well so far and even if a few fail, I should still be good.
Famous last words. Hope you're right though
Bitchcoin

buy some now and some pre-market. shit going gap up lol
Sell and buy something with a better strike price
Selling early is smart. Holding until it crashes is dumb.


You'll never time anything perfectly. Be smart and take money. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
I've been buying at strikes I can afford to buy 5-10 contracts and then I sell 60% at 60% profit. Reclaims 90% of my cost basis and leaves enough to have fun with.
Now
I got in at 11.25
Both
The hype is building so fast. I would just get in if I can.
same tf is going on lmfaooo
Same. The 2023 5c better fucking print
I'm waiting for this to materialize too and will jump in when it starts to pump
Maybe another Biden bump cause Trump conceded
The difference is we're rounding the corner on the pandemic (hopefully).  I own mostly pandemic stocks and those went up pretty well today too.  I think there's not a lot of playing the market going on (comparatively speaking)
Real talk all this pumping is fun, but nasdaq has no gas anymore. It's feeling very heavy and tired.
I  am with you.  Have long leaps.  Movies will be back.  Already getting emails for concerts and etc.  Just hoping they start before AMC goes bankrupt, lol
I feel ya. What strike? I bought 12/18 $14c and 1/15  $15c on Thursday. If I only waited a day
i have a legitimate theory that amazon will take over a couple countries by the end of 2021
If you have money, buy 2023 AMZN calls, IV is low, bottom of the channel, forget it and come back to Monaco yacht money.
That a boomer stock
Fuck Apple and Msft too. Fuck FAANG in general Im gonna take all my $$ to PLTR and JMIA

Too late bud.. already lost 5 bands on HYLN
PLTR aint stopping tomorrow I can tell you that much
Because it lost like 700 million last year, so that's better than losing 1 billion, so bullish
Because it doesn't go down

Yeah it will know. Basically, if you've maxed out a spread (IE, its at like 90-95% of what its final value will be) and you don't want to get margin called, you pretty much have to do this. I usually do it when a spread is at like 90% or so and say the remaining 10% is tipping the dealer. Its way way less stressful than getting margin called.

Elon tweet about lidar triggered their CEO into mad shit talking Tesla. This is causing a perceived rivalry and associating them with Tesla for good press.
I've got a bunch of May contracts that are up bigly! Gonna hold onto em for now.
I agree. Bought 200 contracts, might do another 200 lol
What do they do?
Probably price at market close
Im guessing it closed there. Ameritrade reverts to the closing price when after hours trading session ends. Not for every stock though, idk why.
Theyll be here soon. Best believe im buyin leaps
They aren't stupid enough to put their whole net worth in it because the guberment is going to try to take their guns, collapse and minorities will run wild.  Not sure of the order but involves all three.  Somehow gold will save them too.
Gold is a "doomsday prepper" play. Save for the impending apocalypse. 

Right leaning individuals tend to be more self-reliant, and therefore tend to be more susceptible to this type of propaganda.

not sure, everyone is saying tomorrow its going up. love me sum weed tho
GRWG. They sell supplies.
Possibly
yea my really basic understanding is they sell the shit needed to grow weed.
Related but more stable since they do not get into all the technicalities weed companies like lack of financial help from banks and they do not need to worry about new weed companies sprouting up left and right which will actually more than likely benefit GRWG.

I bought at 15 after watching it since IPO.

I think it could run a bit more this week, but I'm preparing for a pullback.
no one knows what the next resistance is, except maybe a natural one at 25?  Maybe 22.5?  but as long as you're doing it for long term it's probably fine

Theres just not a lot of upside left for the broader market. Maybe 10-15% thru 2021. The mega techs are reflecting this as investors are unwilling to aggressively bid for them. Instead we're seeing the rest of the market "catch up" to the behemoths. At some juncture there's going to be an inflection point. Either the market goes parabolic in response to more helicopter money or prices correct 10-15% to levels which will draw in buyers.
Tech is just a bit lower because of rotation into different stocks because of vaccine

Get some cheaper contracts. MARA and RIOT are two hot plays with decently cheap contracts. Might be biased as I Just entered positions on those today. FSR hasnt moved in two weeks and is on a downtrend towards $15. NIO premium too expensive.

For a 100 I'd find a crazy otm play that expires wed and hope to get lucky.  Otherwise save up a few grand and then start playing
riot is a scam
MARA is a better play rn

I think you may be looking at the wrong chart my friend.
Best thing I ever did with GME was get shook out at an $11.08 stop loss.

Went on to greener pastures.

Too much downside for an upside that I think caps at $15-16 in the short term.

The long term transitions Wonder Boy is talking about takes a long time and I'm skeptical anyway. With achievements etc. the console makers and publishers have all the knowledge of the digital footprint anyway.
Use those gains to buy shares!
"on accident" right...
I've got over 30. Its a lot easier with shares, I always felt like I needed to monitor my options. Right now I'm about 3:1 shares to options, and I've only got a couple that expire this week. It was getting in the way of me being able to work, so I had to make a change.

as someone who sold NIO at open today, just sleep well when you know you earned something and didn't lose all your money like all the other loss porn retards in here. Trust me. If your gain beat the market (historically roughly 7% for stocks, 11% if you index the S&P 500), then you should sleep well. Any three digit percent gain, you should sleep great. Not sure what type of gain you saw here but profiting in options is a lot harder than some of the crazy gain posts in here would make you think.

The end of their need across most industries is in still way more clear now than it has been in 8 months. They might get more business until the summer, but we know roughly when we wont need them anymore. Its over. The markets looks forward my guy.
That thing has been unbelievable, I dare not enter it and fuck it up for everyone.
Gamma is a derivative of Delta. It's shorthand for being more profitable the "closer" you are to strike.  For instance if the strike price is 100, the gamma is going to be quite high at 99 or 99. Gamma will be next to nothing if your strike is at 20. (Not close at all).
Delta is important yes
Gamma is the first derivative of delta ( or d^2 C/dS^2). Its basically the rate of change of delta. A lot of MMs playing theta want to stay delta neutral (so when writing calls theyll typically buy the underlying to hedge against the upside). This act of buying the underlying drives up the price which in turn drives up the call value, in essence creating a feedback loop and thus increasing gamma

Forward thinking market man, people are betting on what is gonna be up 30% from now come summer
You really dont understand how many fing boomers there are that love cruises. On top of the fact the stock was 60 fing dollars last year and it was 8 this year... AND THEN. What do you think is going to happen when things actually are back to normal. You think people hate water? You think people aren't going to go on a fing boat and drink and gamble. And who do you think is going to take that market. Some start up company thats never done cruises or yourself. Or do you think the massive company will regain its market share. It's a unique time and when its all said and done they will be back so how you can be surprised is beyond me.
I sold to close a 12/18 $10 call for $80 before earnings.  Planned on buying it back but had money tied up.  That option is currently worth $2350...

That won't soothe your fomo and butthurt.
Biden as next president is  most priced in. Short term AH hours enthusium bump is not sustainable.

You're vastly richer than most people on the planet.
Most retirement calculators say you need 2-4 million to retire comfortably at 65. Welp, have a good night
Depending on your age, not bad
keep it up champ, you'll have a worthwhile account one day.
Don't forget to count a kidney. You can sell one of those
Why!?? THCB is MOONING
Same. And more FCEL
If you get in around $10 who cares. Youll get refunded $10 p/s if no target is acquired
idgaf they just need to make my calls print
Dgaf if they can make cars. They can make me tendies
its 2020 bro not 1998, bow before the new lord and savior of our portfolios
No one is buying any of that shit here. We are here for tendies my dude
Who do you think makes those iPhones? Wait. I guess they are shit. Who makes your Androids? Wait..
They can make both high end and low end products.

Youre more man than me, I sold the PLTR 23c 11/27.

Might get in more selling some puts.
Puts guaranteed to print tomorrow, you know how it goes
It took you this long to learn?

Fuck no, none of this shit is good long term investment
Short term
Short term good investments
Do you love your country?
It's a shit stock, play one with upward momentum.
Idk tell us mr. Nostradamus Jr?!
The algos know its the top...
Manipulation bruh.
Depends what time you bought it at. Right before close? Probably a good move.
I would if they had any in stock

EVs
i bought a shit ton of 25c's 12/18.
Let's see how long this bitch drags down
DD?
To poor,
Yes. Market's retard strength and optimism is on full-force right now. A huge cherry on top for covid recovery itself. Thinking about adding pretty heavy positions for March 2021 $5 calls
Lol why?
Yea
Pretty much yes. Then there is risk it can drop below whatever the floor has been.
Tried that, didnt work but good luck
SBE as well
MP had yet to takeoff like these EVs.. yet has more viability than most of them
In LTHM, LIT, ALB, SQM, VALE and all are printing.  Sold LAC since it isnt moving.
Cuz its a shit company. As much as all the third-tier companies are rocketing, I cant put more than $5k to these. Big positions on first and second tier EV (related) companies only.
Why did I sell my blnk options at 12? Friggen missed 80k+ potential profit. Not selling my other evs now. Lesson learned. Watch them all tank now.
Atitty Roy!
$36 AH still holding here
Edit: $30C 12/18 bought at close last friday
You realize how overvalued it was at 30 right? It could still run up since it has retard strength but be careful, its absurd right now
Cryoport, however it already went up and down
usual suspects UPS and FEDX but they're already up huge this year
I was looking into companies that make dry ice, like Air Products, (APD). Its been going up over the past couple of days, but nothing crazy yet.
Floor is 25
Seemed to be bouncing off 17.9 or 18 last week. Looks like it could fall right into 18 again if it wanted to. Not sure now. Looks bullish.
IV crush look it up
you overpaid because of high IV
were you paying attention to your greeks?
post so we can laugh
Why are you guys trading if you don't know about IV?
What happened after that?
Its odd though because QQQ has been shorted like crazy for two weeks now
If I had to guess most calls are in EVs right now that are running like crazy because tech has not been a bullish leader

I had puts on solo that I sold today because I think retarded bag holders will keep that pos stock elevated for eternity
I dont think it will drop 50 %
It needs to break below 9 before your 5 will start to print.
They like child labor so theyre not cool anymore.
I think you just fucking got it holy shit. Sbe is mooning after hours what the fuck.
is SBE really going to do it again?
>DPW

Dang, were you in on that
yeah,  I just bought 1k and dumped it for .40c gain.  I should hold 100 just in case it does some retard shit like blnk.

13k in FCEL 9k is loans
Depends! AYRO has a great 4:30am shift that drives the price through the atmosphere every day like clockwork the last 4-5 days.

Nobody is doing any work this week. That includes the government.
Lolz. 3 percent after 30 up. Those who sold will be buying back tomorrow at higher price.
Looks like people like to take profits pretty regularly on that. It has recovered every time so far though.

Thats great news because I finally bought calls today  thank you for your service

We let those expire worthless around here, sir.
He just conceded, I suspect it will have broken his will to do so. Expect the fade out to commence from today to be honest, he's not gonna do any more crazy shit, now the focus is on bribes and favors to keep his ass out of jail.

Dump everything into one account and go from there. If you consolidate your account to 25k you can day trade at least. For IRA account open one with your work and contribute enough to max matching

Nah, they can do quick offerings on the pump and clear a lot of debt tbh
They are great for companies that do a secondary offering when their price is really high. They can raise more and more money that isn't debt without having to dilute much.

Ban this
I FOMO'd at $2, it sank then got back to $2.05 and I pussied out right before close due to fear of a correction. Gainz are gainz
gamma is relatively low
Depends how much is paid off.  Your friend sounds like he belongs in this sub
Are you fucking retarded?
No. Unless its a lease. Or a mechanic. After 100,000 miles then shits break like a mother fucker
Is it a manual?
Its not a yolo its a financial decision, and I mean yeah if hes that retarded and you like the car then do it, youre not tied to any contracts
Make sure the car is going to be in your name at the end if $400 is more than it would cost lease it. otherwise you are just paying the guys loan and he could sell anytime
Memes up today. It feels like a dream
Gamma would have hurt you seeing as we went up into close
Probs
All weed stocks moving I think because of trump administration is begging the transferring of duties to Biden administration
Disclaimer: no idea what this company does and can't find any news. Probably a pump and dump. Proceed with caution.
There was a dd earlier. I bought at 1.60 and sold at 2.25. Felt like a genius. Now, not so much.
Thanks for the insight, I don't have any options but I'll keep it in mind
Yeah AZN and Regeneron news just hit boomers and trump put cherry on the top. $15 aal 11/27

At lunch time get spy calls that are 1-2$ but don't go above 370c
Im holding - watch market cap, not share price. 

One of their manufacturing partners just took an offering also so big money is backing growth. 

Obviously depends on your circumstances- but I think the bull run has fumes and am staying in.
Did they do something? Why is it popping?
No, you just get diabetes.
Yes
get warrants instead - better value and no theta decay

Took a profit on PLTR today and now throwing it in the trash.
Why fight the momentum though
Whats funny is the market broadly didnt even really rally today, its just WSB is all in memes so today was great for this sub lmfao

You've been spamming this P&D all over.
No no.  PLTR is the money maker here.... FUCK RKT and it's BILLIONS in net profit every quarter. 
Let's speculate on a company that will take a decade to make what RKT makes in one year.

Signed a bitter RKT bag holder 
Yep.... Ive been holding since ipo.... I hate them with a passion
I have 25c leaps that are down 60%  good thing I have a year for them to print :)
I picked up more. Am I retarded?!
I just got in to some RKT options EOD, we will ride to tendie town together.
Yes
Right. This is a typical year and we have a typical president. You're so sure we'll be green this week that you went cash gang and left free money on the table.
Imagine thinking buying spacs at/close to nav is a bubble 
Your puts are not welcome here. 
First woman in a fed chair position. Plays well w others. Great edging skills.
Is what we all said almost 3 weeks ago
Ur dumb as fuck if you just realized that.
No guarantee that 200% holds all night. It feels 10,000 times worse to lose the sure gain than to miss on theoreticals.
Did you know future
You can't time the top idiot.  Be glad it's above 0
You made the best decision at the time with the information available.

Futures are bouncing off resistance at 3599. If it doesn't break through, the trend is still only slightly up.
Bird in hand worth two in the bush. Used to beat myself all the time over what ifs.... lost 2.2k on Corsair earnings, paper hand sold my 35c 11/20 that would have made me 10k a week later. Was my first big loss and was kinda down for a day. Made it worse when I tracked it going up non stop and not buying back in. Just gotta move on man. Back up 1.2k earnings two weeks later and not looking back. You got this king 
I did something similar. Ill never feel bad about this because Ive been burned way too many times. Im going to take my gains and dive back in tomorrow. Dont try and become a millionaire in a day. Give it like 4 days.
With that attitude youll probably never be RICH rich off stocks but you probably wont go to 0 either.
Gambling kinda sucks cause when you lose money it sucks. When you win money, it still kinda sucks cause you could have bet or made more. Take the money and get on with your next move.

buy brk. It has lots of apple + you get all the just perfectly fine businesses quite cheap.
Youll get exercised on 11/27 at $65 a share. Assuming you actually own the shares to cover the call, youll actually MAKE money if your average buy price was less than $65. Youre not losing money, just missing out on profit by hedging.

Probably because metals went up due to fear of a bad future but now that covid is coming to an end and a President that is cool with China is taking over, people are no longer afraid.

I don't see why not.  Better to start now and have life suck for the next 5 - 10 years than to wait.  House prices aren't going to be going way lower and you're going to get a great interest rate.
Nope. Youre broke
You need more trading
Wrong sub
damn thats all u had to take out in student loans with ur salary ? i make about the same but i owe a fkn 130k in student loans
If you have decent credit you should be able to afford a house no problem. The student loans don't make a huge difference. The 10,000 personal loan might be a factor though depending on how much you gotta pay back a month.
Trade options earn yourself a house within a month
possibly but would depend on your credit/other debt factors. you can prob get a house but one not in the range youre thinking. look up mort calculators
Whats the price of the home youre looking to buy? DTI is calculated pre-tax.
Ur setting yourself up to be poor.. And you make decent money! Pay your debts. You're paying interest and attempting to earn interest. Fuck paying interest, then make interest work for you. Scrap that lease if you're not making the tax bennies. You should be debt free in a year and then build that stock account to 60k and then use half for the down payment. GL
You got no money how are you gonna buy a house
You can definitely afford a house but because you have so little capital your down payment would not be 20% and you would need to pay PMI until you reached 20% equity in your home. Also, you can afford a house in the Midwest, not anywhere cool or good
Ill be very honest. This is not the group to ask.
Boo hoo I made 2x profit instead of making more.

Go suck off a hobo dick if you want to be a bundle of sticks.
Gains are gains. Get ready for the next play slugger
Dont feel bad man, you only missed out on $105,705
Taking profit like you did will get you much further in the game. I know it stings but keep that mentality of taking solid profits.
profit is profit
Nobody ever went broke and starved taking 90% profits. Lock and load, and go get the next one.

*your* advice? Cmon man. Give fO credit for his play
What strike did U buy
you son of a bitch, i'm in for 100 shares.
Okay boomer
The signals are all over the place. The way stocks, bonds, metals, USD, etc are all reacting to one another is sort of nonsensical lately. 

Who fucking knows. Weird bubble behavior, maybe?
So.. NIO 100c 11/27?
Because OPEX is tomorrow.  Big boys had to cover their shorts because it didn't drop as far as they thought it would.  Miners likely bottomed today, metals tomorrow. Both will start rising later this week and then in December it's off to the races.
I'm convinced the money that would have gone into gold/metals is now in shitcoin. Finite supply, more portable then gold, exchangeable for real fiat. Look at were you'd expect gold to go up and then look at bit$ chart.
then or than
You dont have to worry about it because Goat fucking is your thing

PLTR was formed in response to a lack of communication between federal law enforcement and military departments before 9/11 which would have prevented the attack. Do you hate America? Hey guys, tell this person what happens when you bet against America...
We ain't investing nerd
Because they offer a data program for the governement? That helps store records of illegal immigrants which crumbles down to separating families etc? 

Why should it be up to a bunch of engineers to decide whether its ethical or not to sell their product to a specific company. If its legal than its fine.

They only sell their product to society with democracy so if what theyre doing is legal but unethical its on the people of society not the engineers/company.
Money doesnt care about ethics or morals, we re here to make money not make the world a better place. Same goes to all the electric car bs, it is not for the environment, its for bigger pockets.
wait what news?

>Its gonna cut jobs across the board.

No, it isn't.  In fact, it's going to result in an even larger boom in child labor in the lithium and cobalt mines of Africa.
If people cared about jobs we'd go back to horses
Thats a pretty myopic way of looking at it
lol who cares those are boomer jobs
Broken window fallacy. Would you rather have a car break and a mechanic fix it, or a car work and have whatever economic output that mechanic could have done in their free time?
It takes jobs to build evs
EVs will need a different kind of mechanic, who knows how to work on them. They'll still need tires and brakes and alignments and shocks and struts, so there's still maintenance to be done for the traditional tech. The guys who learn to work on the EV side are going to make bank, though.

I've been in HCAC since August, and I follow it pretty closely. I watched the entirety of the Barclays Global Automotive Conference presentation. Takeaways:

* Early December they reveal the last mile delivery vehicle.
* Currently on track to complete the merger by the 12/31 deadline. Essentially working on a couple things w/ the SEC.
* In Q1, they will be disclosing deals/contracts.
* On two separate occasions they referenced Amazon and Walmart as businesses who would benefit from their last mile delivery solution. To be clear, they did NOT infer they had a deal with either, but it piqued my attention.

Canoo is doing very little self promotion. To me, that means they're asleep at the switch, or very confident that their product and the deals they've been working on will do all the talking for them.

Canoo CEO Ulrich Krantz is a real deal auto industry and EV veteran. Read about him.
hcac what? its a spac, u can buy shares now

Ehhh nope

My TNA calls has been printing :P
Lol they have no earnings

How do we factor the side line money plus the addition of new retail and fed investments? Seems like everyone fucked up... too many sold in March, too many bought the dip, and the fed pumped it too much. We either fuck the dip buyers or we break new highs.

Once when I was in the 5th grade while we were looking at a world map a kid asked the teacher "can you see Antarctica  from the southern tip of Africa" and I thought this dummy doesn't realize it's not to scale. 20 years later now that has become the second most retarded thing I have ever heard anyone say.
Pick something closer to atm so you can have some intrinsic value to those options.
How much is an embarrassing amount of money?
Be more targeted... use the trend\\ride the wave more.
If Ive learned anything its that you should never buy puts. If you think its going down, get out of positions and wait out the dip.

Bruh are you retarded. Price x share amount. You have 27 shares, so $100 x 27 shares = $1.270
Its literally basic multiplication and division. How the fuck can you even work a stock trading app if you cant comprehend that?

Yea, Id probably quit now
Lol nice joke
Google Stock option calculator. And learn about the Greeks

YouTube stock options tutorial
Thats are options not stocks. YouTube options trading to get an idea
A call is an option contract with a set expiration date for 100 shares.

For example, 11/27 c is a call that expires on 11/27 at 4pm est. A call gives you the right to buy a stock at a set price. So, if you have a call on PLTR for $20 11/27, any time up to 4pm on 11/27 you can elect.to buy PLTR for $20.
Its called options trading. Options trading involves calls (bets on underlying stock going up) and puts (bets on underlying stock going down), and you can buy whats called a contract (right to purchase or sell 100 shares of X stock by this expiration date) at a certain strike price. If you bought a call at a strike price of 30 dollars and it expires at 12/18.. youd be bullush on that stock and hope that it expires in the money (underlying stock is above 30 dollars), otherwise it expires out of the money or at the money (worthless, contract is worth 0 dollars). Search up what options trading is. Theres so much to learn
Probably boring af. SPY has just come the thing I throw 500 at calls on Friday right before close just to sell on Monday open.  Vaccine pump Monday, slow day Tuesday, bad news Wednesday and Thursday , Friday neutral. +-10$ the entire week. Monday open up a solid +2$ so I just buy calls 1$ higher than what it's closing at on Friday at 3:55. Worked past 3 weeks at least. I'm sure it will fail eventually but going to keep trying it until it does

Take money out of my brokerage account so I don't have so much in there and use too much. Invest like I'm down to my last dollar, ie wait for a perfect opportunity instead of trying to make something happen.
I feel like I've been here before <looks over at pile of worthless shitcoins> nah, probably not
Strong disagree. I stress way  more on the losses.
You make some good points there. I don't feel comfortable losing more than a few hundred dollars, yet I put in $15k and somehow managed to make $4k profit in the last two weeks. It's stressing me out quite a bit, so I am gonna take my winnings and call it good for a while.

Basura!
I had parked some cash in AAPL stocks for the last couple of weeks when it had gone down to 108... liquidated it and put that in THCB... i got in at 10.33...its at 11.26 now...and is showing good strength..fingers crossed!
I dont see how bears stay solvent in a market like this

This is a real company with a great network and growth. If fuckin NIO has a $75 billion market cap right I don't see why ChargePoint couldn't hit $10 billion.

*Safe money don't make money.*

I say that out loud every time I confirm call purchases. But srsly.
Yes SPY 330 
I get that you might be newish here but SPY  was always the play pre 2020
You forget in February when SPY was the meme
Well I have to have a kid first so it gives them 4 years or so
It looks correct to me. What specifically appears wrong to you?
I am in on everything. I got like 10 top movers.
[DD Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzkpv1/i_made_the_dd_on_ciic_last_week_now_i_am_moving/)
The stock was very stable before we got our hands on it today. Not a whole lot of downside like you said
That's assuming that any have bought in
Another China ev play, some dude posted long DD on here recently that called the ciic run up too
not really but its my first time buying on margin lol feels sketchy
This is the way.
Spliffs and calls all day tomorrow
500 dollars and 300 dollars. up over 600-750% on my calls overall.
brother its up 14% AH. youll be fine. im FOMOing into it tomorrow.
i am. I need about 40k to exercise all my nio options so im day trading in another account so i can get my 4000 shares. gonna hold until they level out and start selling calls on them for juicy premiums.
No difference if he exercises or sells. Taxed the same either way.
About the same, my biggest gainers are FCEL, BLINK, PLUG and PLTR. I sold BLINK at $32 tho.. I shouldve stayed haha
Lol they indeed are. PS5s for everybody!!
Amazing battery technology  look at price movement after hours, it's going to be like a ball rolling down the hill. It's literally just been pushed. This could hit big number's
You are welcome. Just hold, it might stay flat for weeks, it will moon shoot once merger is confirmed
I sold the one call I could afford for 200+ in profit this morning and then bough back in at a slight dip on  another after also getting some more shares. To the moon brother
I think were sitting pretty no matter what you got at this point. How the fuck did we hit 46 even after hours lol
I wish Id gotten in sooner but its helping me get back to my starting investment and you gotta love that
How can you be sure
Nah. NBAC, NGA, SBE and best of all. TSLA.
There are plenty of other plays right now, and that company sucks so much d, I cant bring myself to do it
Ill probably be around 20% if we stay where we are at open
Around 12pm today
Are you me?
Dece
Hmm
Good shit bot. Always has my fuckin back like a tru king 
twice as much as feb
If you look at some of the EV SPACs, they all bounced after 3PM or so.  

Certainly, FIII and NBAC did.
Thank you dawg
Okay thank you
Do you need a plastic pavilion in that climate?
They gonna ban solo outdoor yoga and hiking again? Lol
Missed out so much gains last few weeks. I should had FOMOED. 
looks like im riding the ship at open too. im already happy enough with my CIIC gains and THCB prob has more room to run up left than CIIC does
Yea I dont have Tik Tok and Im not about to download it to conduct DD
But he didnt tell you how many shares he owns
Yes $820 calls

Good advice. But Im still not selling! See you on the other side!
Did that with my feb CRSR 30c 1.8k up.. coulda held for >10k
LOL !!!!!
Probably going to end up getting banned as I sure do get reminders often its call wallstreetBETS for a reason lol.
No fan of bears but meme stocks are the kings of going parabolic.

It would only be right for Robinhood to debut via spac instead of IPO
Is eventually before my first calls expire 12/4?
FAANG is dead bro sorry
Zm*
Aint that the truth
I mean, if I understood why the market was so jubilant in the face of the shitty reality of our current world economy, then they wouldn't be memes.
Everyday I watch it go up 30% but I cant bring myself to put any money into it. Like did the market really get its valuation wrong day after day by 30% 
Clearly justifies the moves. Lol
My guess would be 15-20k without having options price history in front of me
That's more than 10k in profit holy fuck
AAPL is trash lately though
Youre not wrong broski 
Ciic is closing in on $30 after 1 week.

Well by the sounds of that Im gonna be rich
I will send you my address for my Uber eats breakfast. And anything else you might wanna do

This is the real answer, puts are only good for hedging, too hard to predict stocks going down in a bull market
This seems wise. Thanks
I think you nailed it. It really is in my head. I dont even have to imagine the irrational group of people. My first experience here was jumping in blind and immediately doubling a $10k deposit. I took out my initial money so I was only playing with winnings and decided Id learn a thing or two about the market. 

The moment I started learning I turned bear and have gotten my ass handed to me ever since. I know just enough to realize how overvalued stocks are right now and not enough to know how to trade it. 

Ignorance really is bliss I guess.
Thanks for this. And holy shit 7k to 600 over 4 months. Thats almost freaky - 7.6k to 500 over 4 months here. Guess Its just time to try going long
All that free BRRRRRRR money has to go somewhere with bond rates still in the gutter
AAPL down 3% today tho 
Theres too many to keep up with rn.
300 shares 4k warrants

Isn't this a penny stock that's being pumped on social media? Lol. Is there a DD?

I mean yeah....I'd bone.
Id say so just hope we keep it, Ive not seen so much new 6 figure accounts. hell back in September before the 9/3 crash I was up to 80K before the wipeout and lost most of it in about 2 days...now Im just selling puts and getting out at 50% profit still bullish all the way but not going through that again

All three will. This is the EV bubble.

Already have talked to multiple SPACs they are all eager to merge.
TSLA added Fords market cap to its valuation today...thats how
The insane run up and hype around them will die down at some point.

Why? Just make a solid options play instead of a retarded gamble on a penny stock

I'm psyched for everyone who makes money lol

I don't want them to lose it. A lively WSB is a fun place
ur retarded. hes saying to take profits, buy in at next dip or if you truly think its hitting 1000%, sell and rethink. ie If you have 120% profit, just sell and wait, you can always get back in
I didn't miss out on anything, did just fine thank you, but this is just getting absurd. 50% week after week is 100% gonna blow up catastrophically.
How did you make 20% from Microsoft? Just trying to learn a bit more about the market.

Warrants are like LEAPs, but traded like shares. Every company has different rules, but usually a warrant can be exchanged for a fraction of a share, like 4 warrants get you one share at a certain price specified by the SPAC. For example, if you have 100 warrants at 4:1 and the stock is trading at $30, you can get 25 shares for $12. The warrants are much more volatile, and I usually get in when theyre under or around $1 and easily see 300% to even 600% gains. The 600% was with KCAC warrants.
THCB, HCAC, NBAC, SNPR, TRNE
I am not a smart man I admit, but i do want me some tendies. just want my calls to break even then not ever fucking with Tim Apple ever again
It had a large gap up over night. Tough to see it flat when everything was mooning. This will be worth it though.

i made a mistake, meant to say i bought and sold. I guess i hate money
I mean goddamn
Wanna know the same thing
No, they never will.
Nah they didn't.
That shit would be too funny though hahaha.
Anything that was an EV. Idk one of them was 10 last year.
Oh youre about to bust...
Which means its more likely to hit 100 in the next couple weeks
Same, only bought 100. At least theyll print still
Not necessarily, but downward movement is more likely to cause IV spike

Im skeptical as well but this shit is coocoo. With the news that they are now beginning the transition I think its possible

Yea I'm in the middle of the fucking desert with family and set a tight stop on SBE at 30.50 when it was in the 32s. Stopped out once I got reception again and already mooning so I'm out. Blast.
I am 200x sure I make more than them.  Thats right I was not eligible to receive these $1,200 food stamps you guys got this year.
Get a real job. Anyone on wsb can write a fictional story.... I mean stock analysis
As close to 4/20 as you can get.
That's sensible. I have $7.5c TLRY FDs, lol.
Ya just shares, 85 so not a ton. I'm holding for a while but it has been frustrating.  At least it's going in the right direction.   I don't really do options much but it sucks seeing all the runners and not getting in.
and if youre an autist like me, you wouldnt even sell luckin till it tumbled down to $2 and then gets delisted and moves to OTC and gains 100%
Bill gates has his hands on it
Check out the DD from 2 days ago, I'm retarded so I dunno how to post a link

Sell more shares by diluting existing shares.

Ideally I'd like to secure profits once it starts dipping, and then sell CSPs to get the stock back

However, I'm either gonna sell out way before the top, or wait too long and it's gonna have a -40% day somewhere
I dont hate money so let the, thanksgiving, Santa Claus rally, yellen announcement and the incoming Biden stimulus begin. There shouldnt be anything that will slow this down.
20K? Ouch
No EV is riding from it being the fucking future and Biden winning. Now his transition to power will actually be smooth because Trump had a good round of Golf this past weekend and realized he should just let it all go and stop being a fuckwit

The run up on all those stocks was amazing though, I made so much money on a couple weed stocks that are now delisted. Getting the same vibes on all these EV companies popping up now, just gotta play it smart.
Yeah I have some APHA 6.50 for 11/27 I've been holding on to.
That would be funny if ACB was down 20% after hours..... but its up 20%

CIIG, SBE, HCAC
Damn. This entire time I thought it was a joke when people said this sub was full of retards..
That is not actually what I was doing. TSLA is wildly overvalued. 2.5x the size of Toyota. Thats absurd. But these others are not yet overvalued and there are going to be a lot of people that want in early which will drive up the price past their real value, as has happened with TSLA.
Yes or.... Im pissed I missed the boat
Bruh, give it time. No company is going to capture the whole market. Do you think everyone in China whats to drive the exact same car?
Well. As much as we can expect from him. Yes. Lol.
Stay cool fam
Nah, everyone already invested in that. We need something new
Whats diff between MARA and RIOT
Also ran out of money. All in PLTR on Friday.
Lol
But you can sell them right? Do they move like options?
Bing
Target is locked. Working on it.
I shouldve sold at the morning peak and buy in again but I didnt. Oh well, diamond handing this shit to Valhalla
Where is Trump when we need him?
Apparently also winning in autism
Will try to at open! Hopefully it isnt super red!
Would love to fuk on this
I probably dont have a choice now lol.

Im not a pussy lol. I also have 2500 shares. 14.18% of my portfolio is PLTR now. Feels dangerous as shit haha
Thanks Bot!
Is this question a meme now? I've seen it like 100 times. Goooooogle it
Expecting a sell off tmmw after a 15% day
I don't know when I even want to sell
Yeah I couldnt bring myself to sell a losing position to FOMO in on ChEV/EV
Make sure you win in your roth and lose in your taxable brokerage
On RH!

Chase your FOMO
Tell me about it.  I just wrapped up a 3 month coast-to-coast road trip in my Model 3 and the ubiquity of Chargepoint stations along the way is what allowed me to buy with conviction.  Their reach and growth is very impressive.  Blink / Volta not even on my radar.
no, it's not... It's a SPAC that Bloomberg reports is set to merge with an EV battery maker.
its pumping on something it never worried about in the first place? we didnt even drop when trump tried to contest the election lmao, were literally having a relief rally on shit that was never priced in

Thank you for rubbing it in. I too would have appreciated 50%
Thanks for the tip! I have some ideas for positions for tomorrow so if I'm right again and lucky enough for them to let it slide you might have helped me out a lot
Dude i'm not mad.. just really insane right now to see. I don't even care .. i'm up 60K on BA/RTX calls.. what i got to be mad about? Am i disappointed i missed out on all these 10 bagger hydrogen/clean energy bullshit  everywhere? Somewhat. Just weird lately. I think since blue chips are literally priced in, and bonds don't yield shit, you have even managed money chasing these meme stock trends now.. which amplifies the moves even further.
False. Jesus christ
roger that, thanks
Im a sucker for VIX calls and always lose my ass but maybe this time itll be different lol

Yes, yes, and yes.

Next party - magic mushroom stocks
No way. If shitty EV stocks can moon 200% on absolutely nothing, weed can at least match that with legal headwinds as a justification. And it's only up 40% from it's September lows right now.
Play them second time. Rain me money, weeds!!!
Lol
Wouldnt get hopes up on that. It appears that many people whom voted in the recent election in GA are having their voter registration status purged so they have to register again. Something fishy is definitely going on in GA.

This time as well
But you know at some point really soon it will rotate back to big tech. I missed the meme options so setting up for the bounce back now
Looks like it. FAANG is FUUKD for a while.

Then when I have calls, its always the top.
Bro Tiffany got bought out already chills
This lmao
I dont have any options here, I bought 300 shares at $12.75
Well for one GME is looking hard into e commerce expansion, so all of your points will eventually actually help them. They largely were ignorant and ignored e commerce at the beginning, doubling down on their dumb ass decisions not to shift to it, but recently they realized from covid that if they don't they are fucked.
RC tender offer to buy out GME and reposition GME
Oh and to add - that would definitely also trigger the short squeeze
"this time is different"

i'm guessing you're all-in calls huh?
What if beat ones are my top tier
NIO seems like a legitimate long term hold.  Fisker is advertising on billboards regarding their vegan interiors around the city I live in and I still cant bring myself to in that company. Wtf cares about vegan interiors?  Doesnt tesla already do that?
Im not saying it wont keep going for another week or two. Its just, everyone is making quick money. Thats a red flag for me
Exactly, gotta have ammo to buy the dip, when one comes around.
Lol I'm a  so I have trouble making money unless every meme stock goes up at once
Id say 20k for doing nothing at all in a single day is pretty fuckin sweet
I know :(
Thanks
Makes sense
Buy at open or wait for dip?
I am hardcore on the PLTR train but sold half my position today at 21 cause 80% gain Im not walking away from completely
Why warrants?
Let's shoot for 10% 
24 3/21 here
For sure. Im selling my calls in the AM and getting back in after thanksgiving.
It's an AI thing.  The more data you feed an AI the better decisions it will make.  That's one reason China has such an edge on AI.  They track everything from every one and there are more than a billion people in China.

Wait till it runs to $30 again and then Buy... lol.
get in now before ICLN hits $300 in 2023
Ohio buddy. We doing almost CA type shit and we are like half their size.
I dunno. Wherever he picked it up.

Just wait until Donny Pump turns into Donny DUMP and blacklists gyna companies on his way out out of spite
This one feels right
Thank you.
Because Trump is going to somehow get the Supreme Court to overthrow millions of votes and multiple states? Or do you have an actual not demented reason?
When I have calls, the market drills almost 1% in one candle like it did at one point today.
Its different this time
I don't think so too but I just follow how the market reacts lol
XD
And titty bar tabs are deductible so it will be a wash
It is every Americans duty to evade taxes
I mean if that's all he made and he gets a return normally it will probably just wipe out the return
Im not really worried about the taxes I have a pretty good job and this is just play money
I know. But it's not he is not conceding. He is still fighting the decision lol
if something gets kicked out of the S&P500 dont shares have to be sold? by hedge funds that need to readjust?
No one went broke making a profit my guy, and youll get back whatever losses you take. Just takes time
Buy ENG. thank me later
Any. There hasn't been anything. My bet is we'll get some kind-of pumpy something or other news this week and this will moon.
Teach me how to scalp this daily with something like $10k ?
Except you have to deal with short term cap gains there. Unless youre doing it with your Roth
Dont you think $1000 is too much for dec calls?
Thinking of 550c
Sector is hot, fomo, severe fomo, new stonk shine, and delta/gamma manipulation.
Everyone is buying everything june 7th was a better example tbh just a lot of fomo
Nicely done! WSB keeps saying oil is dead and yet it's been on a tear since the vaccine. I guess I like dead sectors then
XLE hit $47 in June when the market thought we will open up soon. And now we have actual working vaccines (plural). With all those wells that shut down, there is less supply now. Once demand picks back up, oil is going back up to pre-March levels and even higher. It's simple demand vs supply. 

It's only on reddit where you can say with a straight face oil is dead. In 15 to 20 years maybe. In the next 6 months to 2 years, oil is going back go pre-COVID levels just based on demand and supply.
I'm not hyping it. The market is doing that; I'm merely riding the wave to Valhalla 
Lmfao
Dont forget BABA
I expect it to rise substantially, but in the short term it could do literally whatever. +10% or -10% tomorrow won't phase me. The current market cap is still well under $1B. It's trading at 0.17x sales going into a new console cycle. But GME is hella volatile because of it's short float.
I was thinking that. Is it really gonna be the next CIIC? We really trusting that guy with the DD?
Will FCEL continue mooning?
Lowkey same lol
I'm currently not working but got money saved up and even tho I can no way am I buying a 100 shares of anything lmao. 

CRSR is climbing fast like I made more today than what I made last Thursday and Friday haha
I'm actually considering it lol
What do you think the estimated time of that happening? Early-Mid 2021?
Why would you say thats dumb
Shit is truly retarded

Would love to see my $20 calls become a 5 bagger

I read charging EV and went all in lmao
I know, I just wish I had enough capital to allow me to take on more risk. As a student I live off my monthly gains so my risk tolerance is very low. But you right. We will get there.
Gtx 1660 super is very good

From what I'm reading I don't think so. I am going to deposit more and add to it tomorrow on a dip
I see 150+ easy
hard to say as it's a growth stock in a relatively new sector (EVs) that is defined almost entirely by Tesla. For those that aren't familiar with Chargepoint, their main focus is Level 2 (240V output, can charge about 100 miles in 4 hours). Their software works great for queueing who charges next.


I think if they can pump out more on Level 3 (DC fast charge) for B2C and roll out more Level 1/2 solutions for B2B...this could run to $100 easy.
But should it run other than because TSLA is going up?
Yeah. Unfortunately investors are already starting to get wise to that one. Im eyeing the some of these Chinese names up 30% a day. They cant all be baby Teslas.
Luckin coffee had real gAiNz too and we know how that story ended.
Feels good. Fuckkk em

calls on this comment
Why do you say so? Its been p flat past couple days
December 8-17 seems to be the possible range for what its worth. I assume sooner rather than later as who wants to IPO right before Christmas holidays
Rumoured to open a tendies island, not too sure tho maybe tendies ship?
Airbnb will be a couple days earlier, December 8-17 is the range but likely the earlier half

oh is it? I assumed it was a weed company.
same lol
Huh?
This shit is gonna get big 
Watch!
Agree
I like your username so I agree with you...ALL ABOARD THE ENG TRAIN!!!
haha, for an ev stock in this climate, it definitely is.
Lol no I'm looking at locked in profits on my 20$ 11/27 calls and picked up nekkers 21.5$ calls in the very last minutes of open market.

I'd like to lock in ~1.5-2x of what I spent and then ride the wave to tendy town with say 3x remaining to play out over the week.

I've learned not to buy puts. It took me 6 months but I learned. Drove my account do down 95% all time and have since recovered it to down 30% all time. If PLTR keeps doing PLTR things this week, I'll be break even by EOD tomorrow.
I cant trade options with it?
Not sure why people get so stuck on a stock that used to perform. 

There are always stocks that will take you to tendie town, bet on those ones.
This. Just move to what is working.
It also sells cocaine

So many plays today. Misread KNDI. I was loaded on $12 calls on Friday that I bought during the dip. Wish I held. 

But I went hard on a combo of TIGR and DMYT so didnt overload BABA. Still cashed out nicely from the weekend hold and established new Dec position.
Thats a perfect strike to duration!
Good for you!
I did not, but Id probably vibe with it judging by your user name. Salute.
my platform doesn't have THCB :/  


any other suggestions?

True, but check out the phat profits on them all.

What strike/date
Same, Im convinced
Yes, a numskull! lol
I sold an XPEV 12.5C 1/21 I bought for $750 for like $1700, when XPEV was at 22 
i bought 1k in 20c exp 12/18 on friday.  you think its gonna pump more and soon?
Best date and strike to make the most money this week?
Baba is sketchy but I want it
We rolling tomorrow! Haha.
Lol enjoy those inflated premiums and 300% IV calls. ;)
But which one? Chinese EVs are mooning, spacs have already rocketed or are planned to soon.
Sounds like a good idea
Oh just wait

They already have distribution nation wide, they are still undervalued in market cap, and they have a strong advantage over competitors in their niche because theyre producing

I bought in at 2.50 /share and this is the first day we didnt go green, it was bound to happen sometime and I think its a good sign that it did not drop much after the bubble popped. I think its back to green tomorrow
Are you late? Its not going to. Citron said its a scam company.
11/27 500? Lmao
Baby shit
Market closes early on Friday. 1 pm I believe
So... buy calls amirite?
Same id be breaking a lot of my trading rules but not fighting the tide is one of them

I bought only 2k, and add baba weeklys, that didnt end up well!
I am in apha family but weed won't go up fast until we leave EV. Maybe after Thanksgiving
Talking about these xpev share posters and shit
Well thats acceptable in those cases. Just saw some actual stock pics
You can buy Warrants AH on most brokers!
I did already duh. What are you late?
Im holding puts
No options is a bummer.

Check out my $347K YOLO on that ticker.
no taxes on short term capital gains bruh.
i think i'm ok with the 100 shares I have. CIIC had pre orders so this oen might be different.
tax in broekrage
No. Thats my whole point retard. Its a bloodbath inside of FAANG, yet the Nasdaq is barely unchanged because TSLA is now a half a trillion dollar product, thats propping up the entire index.
"I'm from Buffalo where it's cold in summer" gets me good.

Dont matter, bought CIIC on the dip today and already up 25%. Tendie town soon come
broker doesnt let me or I would be all in
Yea
Literally everything. At a minimum
nice
I only do shares, thankfully all time Im up 6k+ but days like these is where you make good money but I was asleep lmao, its coo
theta thetaburg, we have plenty of time
Having a pullback and moderate correction would be the logical thing for IWM to do. I doubt that will happen in this market. Why not just yolo it all into an ev like NIO or Xpev?
If she doesn't have them, at least she can afford them.
I suspected that 2020 was one giant elaborate plot for MMs to buy the dip lol

I knew that already, thanks for the CIIC call out mane! I  bought in at 13 and sold at 17.5, looks like we should have held! Thanks for the others tho. Might have to go all in on one of these, the hype is real.
Careful you might attract the 200 surgeons who are all apparently WSBers to come and shill that ticker if you say it too loud
Who they merging with?
my PT for shares is $20, will sell my shares and warrants when it hits that
lmao, i used up the last of my cash for this play
Sunnuvabitch I'm in
Why did it moon today?
I warned y'all. Eat shit.
I don't really care about all the retards flaming me.. that "blind bullishness" becomes literally a mental illness, the complete and total position bias kicking in, peak fucking euphoria.. I'll sell all the calls you retards want..
so all in tomorrow at open?
Damnit Elon tricked me into playing TSLA today instead >.<
Shitcoin runs. These run with it. Look at November 2017 chart on RIOT for reference.
Yep, I'll second TDA. Still got RH as the backup, but using TDA 99% of the time.
you haven't seen anything yet..2021
Thanks
Thank you sir
For sure the biden pump will lift APPL out of this consolidation channel.
And 40 CIIG
when did you get in and whatcha got?!
I like that idea too.  How far OTM?

Buy a company that is doing the exact same thing as meme stocks.
Doesn't see why it would crash for three straight months from 135 to 114
Right, I get buying into the momentum if youre so inclined, just dont pretend you can quantify where a retail fomo bubble will end up.
KNDI went up 30% today on 0 news... as a KNDI holder I'm really happy.. but.. wtf?
Hoping so
Nice I bought one at open then bitched out and sold it at 10:30 lol I bought more palantir calls though so wasnt that bad.
Thetagang wins here
F that feels worse than just losing it lol
Same bro I doubled down, should have sold at open .
I know, that stinks dude. There are support groups for smoll pp gang, u b ok
Nice! 40 2/2021 6c
Boomer
I bought puts and am probably gonna lose money on them. Shit's fucked
No worries. Did the same exact thing with SBE, except it was a 35c

I jumped on some Plug calls this morning and that shit is up 209% so I cant complain
big oof inbound
Sell calls at open
But I only have puts
Nice!

Nice choice bro!
Shares are the safe play, warrants will go to $0 if merger falls through, while u get cash back with shares. Obviously Im in on warrants.
Calls if big pp

Warrants if regular pp

Shares if tiny pp
Next EV runner!
Around 180 rn.

I scaled in today, so my average is like 64 or so? So I mean a move to...last week's highs is profitable. Shit I was barely at lunch time lmao
Yeah this is..a bit much.

72% in 3 trading days
Already got my moon ticket stamped on that one
Gimme positiosn
I'll look into them.  Thank you 
What strike price?
I love you
This is what I can offer: https://stocktwits.com/Stonkasaurusrex/message/258599738

Godspeed.
Yes this does make me feel better. Thanks fam.
I can see the appeal of weeklies.
Sounds like the title to a 2000s rap love ballad or some shit haha
One can only hope
Its at $38 a share rn. Up 60% today AGAIN
As long as it takes off before my 12/11 275c expire I'll be happy. 
Oh, so this pump won't last then.
The rest of the world already wrote DJT and his crew off weeks ago
They will eat dirt but moon again
what do you have?
Ok SPACs/Blank Check Companies for EV startups are one thing but for Cannabis?  Sketchy at best.  I know the kind of people that look for funding for these companies and I would not be in business with a single one of them.
You played yourself selling at a 10 cent loss...
Warrants here, stock incoming tomorrow
Dude yeah i wrote 550s...it could be there by morning...
I'm guessing that refers to the bears
No options
This
By tomorrow 
[deleted]
I sold mine for. More EV plays
THCB DUH
I don't do Chinese but yeah I hear u
Picked up 12/18 $11c EOD. Just not sure how much these will go up in value.
Explain, please
Stfu
Maybe after 7:1 stock split
I sold wayyyy too early this morning but then got back in on the dip 
Yea Im fully prepared to switch into some long term puts in the next few days. Even if the stock is going to do well theres no way this quick of a rise is sustainable. Just dont know when its going back down.
Nagger
Love love love
Maybe a casual $60 open tomorrow?
Glad I kept my calls gah dayum
It's Butterfly network

I went with canoo instead
buy stock in it, merger finalization news soon which will pump to near 20
If it follows the same pattern as CIIC, no it's not too late
Don't even stress man, profit is profit
Yeup lol

If he gets stripe i will personally masterbate to a picture of him
Same and NIO
Gimme another one. I wanna fit in with the young kids

There will probably be a consolidation of some sort, even this week. Last few trading days has been a sick sick move,  but I dont think tomorrow is the day.
A lot of people do. A lot of vol on some 120 strikes I seen earlier.
Weird... I joined on the 24th
I never gave a number, they just offered it to me
Friday and to take profits. I thought about keeping my $30 May call, but the rest of my capital has been bleeding (MSFT) and to be honest I wanted a win.
What are EoW expectations? Or should I look in to like December calls?
I cant afford amazon at the moment lol
Why KSS?

I got assigned on nio 46.5c last week. Its stronk
Two chins, in *this economy?* lady must be doing well for herself
But they sell electric things ...
lol
ER tomorrow
Honestly any EV besides TSLA and NIO imo but they definitely have insane momentum. Ill take a closer look at xpev
That would be fucking fantastic. And I already have 2000 FUSE.
Not much. Were just piling in. Get it.
Yep. WSB PUMP
Stop shorting spy then 
Nice job! What were the major plays?
NIO lol?
Try reinstalling the app?
Nice! Started with $3k and up 146%
Bear?
Nice job! Not an easy feat
Got it last week, thought thered be a pop today.

I know its consolidating, but I want it to have its day before the EV craze comes down.
Yeah, paid for with free money!
Yeah bro but puts on brick and mortar. Like Macys
Will they beat?
Yeah probably but what concerns me the most is not being union protected. Im not afraid of doing some stupid shit and getting in trouble but its nice knowing the union has your back in any situation

IBEW
Yeah thats what I'm thinking
Yeah I think youre right. It'll look good on the resume being management but its not what I want to do.
Nice that's good to hear thanks for the heads up!
This made me giggle
Stock Moe gave you head?
His video are inline with this sub but more level headed.

I'm trying to make this analogy fit, but it just doesn't make any sense. Sorry bro.
Yea nbc news media kept showing the crowd at airport and saying how it is covid risk. I wanted scream at tv and ask them how come this was ok during the protests. These airports have excellent air filtering so dont give me indoor bs
Ooo I do.  Considering I bought this morning Im happy.  Leggoooo
heh heh. And take the first big red ride down? O\_o
Bro life must be hard for people that trade solely options
How is a stock that is up nearly 50% old news breh
Checked your ticker and its so gay man
Yes sir in boffem
Sold before 50% but sure made some nice tendies
I'm not here to make friends im just here to make you some money. There's options available for it too
Yeah youre probably right
2 days in current market maybe 1
Just buy calls of evs and pltr... How the fuck do you lose money in this market? It's so free.

We getting the infinity stimulus
Bc I keep buying puts 
Duh...the peanuts are inside of me.  I put them in my mouth by the handful they're delicious.
Estimates will suck so it won't be bad
About to?
Good enough for me. 225 shares in, because day trading shares seems to be good this week. Godspeed to us
I dont know about you, but I call that a prime time event
Honestly with how insane EVs have been on here I don't know many on that would oppose the Green Deal as long it helped their meme stocks.
Its too late for him..I remember my first time putting in $1000 only to watch the price drop all day. Now Im at once a month
Thats exactly why this pump and dump will work. Theres a bunch of you blindly trusting the guy that just made you money lol
By the looks of AH. Yes.
GG
Shares or calls?
Bruh today? Its up 30% since the start of November shits been on fire

Cuz he has calls
They just need to give out auto loans on EV for cheap. Win win for us all
Your wild. Pltr is gonna drop, and then rise up bigly
Which?
To ease the pain or... ?
Every time I'm greedy I end up losing $8k on AAPL calls. :(
I'm in on all the standard WSB plays right now, from PLTR, CRSR, to NIO.
Cross the rubicon don, do it
Being butthurt wont make your money come back salty cuck

One is outpacing the other at least.
Thank you brother
Why? I just bought $4,000 worth. It's all my money lol.

Hmm . Math checks out.
You have a DD?
Dude, CIIC isn't just going up because it's an "EV SPAC". Arrival is the best company that has gone SPAC this year outside of Draftkings. Don't expect every EV SPAC to run like CIIC. Selling a clear winner just to roll money into a "maybe" is not a smart play.
Check out the DD on it posted today
That seems too logical, so won't happen.
All EV booming
!!! Thats important !!!
Mango will be enjoying 4 more years
I'm all in on PLTR

a blank check company for money from u and me dude... do u not know what spacs are?
This
Just need the reassurance as it dropped percent on close
Bought it at 16.50
I mean it is up now. Just wanted to take some gains. I've been on the other side way too often where I didn't take gains early enough. But the market is crazy
robinhood's charts are bad, imo.
I didn't need the loan for anything else. I could have lost it all and been able to pay it back by the time interest would have started accruing. Oh well. There will be loans next year
you dont if you dont understand what I just said.

Its not a hard play, but you need to understand how the value of a call debit spread works first. It requires patience, you wont get near full value until close to expiration or if PLTR just shot up to 40+ in which case you could make more.

But out of all these scenarios, which is the most probable.

PLTR dips below 15 dollars and stays below until jan 2022-max loss

PLTR stays above 15 dollars-max gain, 2.3x

PLTR goes above 20 and holds-max gain, 2.5x

PLTR goes above 40+ and holds long enough to take profit-max gain 2.3x Vs 2.5x depending on entry; you lose out on a 3-4x with leaps.
Just tell me what to buy u dumb cuk
When its ITM
whys that bro?
People no doubt said a similar thing at 1,000%.
I bought may calls. Looks like another ev company but subscription service. Looks interesting, someone posted a long dd in the sub
Going up after hours rn. A little but its something
yeah i am surprised we aren't heading back to oil tankers circling with nowhere to dump their oil. that was fun.
Nop, I am just in time. Bought a shit load of it when it was 0.25. More than 100% in 3 days.
What?
Yepp I always pull out early or pull out late green is green.
Green gang.
sure how about nbc.

Holy shit jmia was up 103% pass week shit flew pass my radar rip...
I shouldve instead of praying amazing rips. Xpev literally mooned the fuck out along with nio 
Hope not 
25 EOW
Why tho
Sell me on why
Thats true. I played calls last week also and took profits and rolled them into new calls. Bought the dip at the end of last week also.
best kept secret in the market rn...
Dropping 5k on it tomorrow. Shares or calls?
no one told anyone
damn tru
2.75
What's up Monday morning QB
Ooof! Yeah that's a pass from me lol still going to meme in here tho. Same category as ACB
no im holding a fat workday bag when i tried to buy the dip lol
Looks like it's getting in on the hype but they had nice earnings
I also think you should decide shit and stick with it unless it hits yours pre determined targets
Puts in what? Never heard of that. What calls can I buy?
Risk / reward. CIIC is an actual company, thcb is just blank check. Low risk low reward. CIIC higher risk higher reward. Don't want to baghold at 10$ with worthless warrants or smth
Not by name, they were pumping all the EVs in general and the fact that new ones are coming out.
Yeah this was actually the car, thats what surprised me
I probably bought them from you
Ty mate, I'll look for a decent entry.
ICLN is a meme etf you retard, a favorite of wsb
Are you mad or broke?
Ur an idiot
He couldn't and never would pay all of his real estate debt.  

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if he took on even more debt, if any one will give it to him, if he were able to reduce his cost of capital and get some extra cash on the side through equity take-out refinancings.
[deleted]
This was announced AH?
Yup. 

Ive got 92x 3/19 $150p and 40x 12/11 $177p.

Lost about $18k so far.
The nasdaq ended red I thought
Lol buy new shares tmrw
Take some profit and let the rest ride (or roll the profit into further expiry if you are confident)
its a a reverse of a circuit breaker. Limit up is when prices go up so much markets stop for a bit
[Looking pretty good to me](https://i.imgur.com/JkOKOgs.jpg)
can't buy THCB on margin and that's gay asf I'm not a boomer
but I thought it was going to crash LMAO
I'm guessing you're newish here if you think 0.4% is the moon...
Yup I have a single call on each fairly far OTM
Could be epic. Not will be :)  shit could flip red any moment with this market
ok thanks
agreed, this sub will constantly trick you out of doing the actual smart choice. Selling with an above market gain is already a win, most active traders are not beating the market.
That is what the one guy with the all ins from 40k to a million did also...
No way we go down this market is probs the strongest it has ever been over coming bad news every day like nothing the only way I see the market going down. Is a new strain of the virus
Nasdaq forward PE is 31. How much more can that one be strechted

Dow forward PE is 24 (also high but lower)

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/stocks/peyields
22c
I see IV is at ~36 for those right now, how far below the mean is that? Its hard to chart
Im planning on holding for awhile. Its definitely boosted by the Biden/EV craze but it has a seemingly valuable product.
Sold half of my calls, let the others ride. Its realized boo
12/4 8c. Got it with a few dollars sitting in my buying power.
These next 4 years are the real bull run it sounds like
I know its crazy. It was down the whole day for me bc I bought at open at like 14.24 but now we going to the moon
Should I go in for a 25c 11/27?
You son of a bitch im in
Nah 700 million went straight to employee compensation and they gunna buy more stonks with it
Weed  its tight
Thanks, hadn't heard about APXT yet but I'll check it out.

Perfect thank you
Athleta is girl clothes gaha
Jwn is paying for my MacBook. 2500 so far plus tomorrow's run up
I'm thinking of selling right before close. Retail has beaten expectations but there's a selloff right after.
THCB
Sell dude 
I went retard and bought in today at 10 with some winnings, potential to go north or did I fuck myself
How much did you drop? You could become a millionaire if they were ITM and this runs to $10+
Exactly not every stock. Oh well, thank you.
thanks man what did you buy it at and sell it at? will JPM trend upwards?? looking at charts if it breaks that pattern it will go up whats ur thoughts on banks/JPM coming december?
Green line goes up? Cool Im about it
Carried one for work for years.

This.
Just dont drop it.
The CZ = soi meme was forced by glockfags who can't cope with the fact that you can buy a gun that's perfect out of the box. CZ P-01/75 or a beretta 92 would be my choice
I have given it most of my port 

What's your rationale on this
These companies had higher valuations when we were in literal lockdowns. Oil itself is also about to break out of its range and is just short of its post-Covid highs

UK approving Pfizer vaccine this week

Opec making cuts next week

FDA approving Pfizer and Moderna (probably) around the 10th
I don't know a lot but from what I understand the warrants operate similarly to a call option. There's an expiration date (far dated, seems usually around 5 years) and a strike price (usually 11.50). The tricky part is the conversion ratio stock:warrant. Looks like it can vary a lot from spac to spac. There's always forms detailing the specifications of the warrants but they are pretty confusing. Still, the warrants definitely provide leverage, to varying degrees. If you're pretty sure the underlying will pass the strike price, go with warrants.
Have at it.
Interesting, thank you.
market closed on Thursday, some want to enjoy their holiday
The thought of them seeing me now is pure nightmare fuel my friend lmao
Thanks my guy gonna go for it and hope for the best
3$ strike leaps  1/21/22 i bought when share price was  $2.80.
Don't sell covered calls Q_Q
Same.   Still up 5% for the last 5 trading days.  We'll how it goesm. Good luck dude.
Election priced in bruh.
And the Chinamen love to create massive fraudulent companies
We need it to moon more
Sounds like you're just making up numbers no offense. Rest of the market was down because it was sectors hit by covid hardest, unlike tech. Either way if tech falls hard the whole market goes with it
Tech is down 25% from it's highs this summer
Yes so if tech drops so does spy.
Yeah cool buy
More shares 
EV stands for? im learning

DONT STOP

thought i could squeeze out a -1% tmrw but then donnie does this shit
Eliminating the possibility of a hostile coup taking control of the US govt should result in VXX being down more than 1%.
Its only down 1% w all this going on??
I hope but it kinda looks like its already starting to run up a bit. Either way I got a good chunk of cash in.
Not Chinese lol
Lol it came up as something else on RH where can we trade this?
Weeklies are risky, but if tmrw is good then those will print
They are making lots of money right now and will definitely profit in Q4. They are slowly becoming a tech company and Cohen Will try to make the full transition for GME
my app is shit it doesn't have that you guys in America have it good
ah right sorry I wasn't clear. Like I have around 2k in right now, but 100 to make a move for tomorrow
So was NKLA but that shit fucking ran

Im long RIOT MARA rn
Whys mara a better plat
Its not robinhood.
Account was open and active since last week. 

Whats with this weird victim blaming bro. Wanted to trade today and couldnt because of a bug, somehow its not the providers fault?
This.
Oh I'm bullish on that one for the long long term. Thiel isn't someone to bet against.
Weekly cash secured put gang
To be fair, lmao. He'll be what 80 in four years? He's going to understand that the R is what got him most of the votes in the first place. Big money is out and all about Biden. He's cornered bigots and poors. Nice job Napoleon.
Apples head of global security Tom Moyer has been indicted in a bribery scandal involving trading iPads for concealed carry permits.  Lot of euphoria at the moment though so who knows if this even matters.
im not a bear im just sus on myself how i made a green play surely something has to be off
So 10:17 then. Im in Chicago.
I took profits, I was +47% in cash, sold all positions at immense profit at market open. I opened a new position that leaked all my profit which was an AAPL all in.
that is why I said unpopular opinion.

Its WSB bro, did you buy?
My retirement account is heavy on Apple so Im feeling it to
Need a cool -1.5% down day here relax man
Remind me! 5 hours
There will be Halloween on Christmas
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want.
Youre welcome
Lol, I just posted 10 minutes ago about MSFT 3/20 $200C, and anybody who was here in January would have instantly noticed it and laughed. Not one person got the joke.
I've been trading options since 2017. Only down 8% overall.
there won't be time for WSB to bug out when it shits the bed.

that's the whole point.

if there were obvious and easy exits for these kind of ramps any retard could do this. that's why they're called "rug pulls"
He's is officially starting transition to biden. It's in the tweet.
Yeah, PLTR and CRSR are a buy every dip stock.

But I'm holding alot of AMD and hoping for $90 soon
Im hoping for ENG and PLTR to keep flying this week
I just counted and i have 50. 3:1 options over shares. I am going to work to halve the options and toss the losers this week.
Why put on MARA? It seems to be doing well
Lmao fuck you

I made good money with puts at $25 last month

Love that place
Im fucking in
Although NKLA is up 30% over the past week.
I bought FSR calls at the bottom today and asked my friend who worked there for 3 years, why it was down while other EVs mooning. He said this exact thing. Sold immediately after for 2% profit.
Yup another fake ass company like NKLA
This is the way
Hahaha imagine if you tried that on XPEV
lol, the close EOD was the most BULLISH shit ever, pump and a small sell off. Look at AH as well now jesus.... :S Bears not looking good
Live long and prosper.
DD God spoke the true true
Ironically was trying to get ahead of the rotation from energy back into cloud tech lol
I feel like I should have known this. Thx for the info. Bless you with money tomorrow.
Im gay
Im scared. I always join the wrong side at the wrong time.
I need Reynolds to score as many points as Godwin.  They can both be zero for all I care but I really need this win.
YESSIR
Yeah dumbass.  The index is based on the price of 500 underlying stocks.

How would there be actual resistance to an index going past a certain number? You would need to manipulate all 500 stocks in the index to a certain number for "resistance" since the index is actually based on intrinsic value.
cash gang
YOOOO ACB AH I JUST SAW THAT SHIT
How much time would you consider an option to be a leap
I posted earlier today
idk man the last two weeks after vaccine pump monday AAPL was red

and you know what we just got? a vaccine pump

Im already +$500 at close so took the risk
I hope so too.. Their marketing is seriously on point as well.
Shut your face....ass
Idk about you, but I sold today at a huge loss that looks like it will be in the money tomorrow. Im pissed as well.
So funny coz chasdaq ended at 0 but this sub printed hand over fist
I have ridden the wave with Tesla and Nio but I feel like NIo unlike Tsla has no additional good news for this 12 % pop today. Tesla is getting inducted into S&P thats huge.
When is vaccine EUA coming out?
$5c 01/15/2021 

&#x200B;

they will print my friend
True not a fan of the gloss, but I love that off-white
Yeah but Tesla actually has reasons why it goes up
Most people on the planet don't live in VHCOL
Its bad
Koreans man
I know what Shenzhen is and 98% of what they make is shit
Strikes?
bears can tip me for my sacrifice via my only fans tomorrow if shit dumps
it's been like 2 months and during those 2 months I saw 2 giant dumps to 325, so yes it took me this long to learn
She's hot but couldn't make it past 20 seconds.
Thats what I thought. Gonna let yall get your tendies, and Ill scale into long dated puts in the meantime.
ehhhh
Yes right before close
ditto, but probably not as rich as you, I may make $7k if everything goes well
Just the first round. thinking all the students going back home will take tests which will be very beneficial for them.
Why didn't it work
Lovely ones!!
Yes, the EV bubble except TSLA might have a huge red day any time soon. It's an insane run. I'll see how the market opens tomorrow and decide whether to play it or not
The ceiling is the roof.
Bruh that shit was unfair asf
8% correction up until retarded Election Day rally.
Same man!

Im trying to remove the negative numbers from my account to one registered to my dog but these cucks cant even make their stupid game work
The last three days last week SPY crashed straight into close and red AH
nonmarginable
too safe
Is there a chance of this happening
HOLY FUCK I WAS RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME
Nope only just found out
Thats why Im okay dipping out now even if Im leaving a bit on the table. Ill just play on the CSP side where I feel a bit more comfortable. The CC side is like playing with fire.
You got some FTEK at the moment?
Why is it on this run?
I know i wish I could buy calls...huge upside in the near future
neat!
always does
Yh i guess its not much, I haven't been following it for long to be honest. All I know was that it's been 20-30% up at open each day, so a bit surprised to even see it down.
Yeah asked it earlier today. No one answered it then either
True i did not. Same thing before too?
But always come back up
Yeah, AMD is gettin' 'em... but... low P/E ratio and EV hype EV hype!

If scam companies like Nikola can rally hard on this EV hype, why not Intel?
Lollll CLF Ill edit thanks
Upvoted
It dipped Friday. I bought then it kept dipping. Had no idea it would pump but glad it did. This time.
The biggest thing I've learned while learning trading this year is: Trading is mostly about regret!!
It wasn't coming up from trying to Google what I was talking about, but I remembered it might be butterflies and it was.
Was in SOLO, AYRO, FCEL. Made gains. The hype scared me and reminded me of the September 2nd event (albeit, in the EV space).

Transitioned into the good old plays, like NVDA, AMD, TSM and NFLX today.
FOMO power is too strong right now
Gosh remember that first earnings report run up those were fun times
\_eth\_ is going parabolic though
Are you gonna buy back in at any point? She was looking real beat up EOD
Like a man
LMAO this suck gives great DD sometimes but nothing to do with it. I DONT WANNA LOZE DA GAINZ
Noice! I was up [1,700%](https://imgur.com/a/sdgzEVg) on a small ACB bet the election night. But I only plan on playing these every time Sleepy gets closer to the presidency. I'll certainly look to holding long term if they start simultaneously breaking resistance and form an uptrend
>THCB 

what's that
Usually how it goes for me
Yes they are.  It was on the news here in Atl.
check trump twitter
This is the best we will get imo
No he didn't. Just said the transition team could start while he continues to totally prove he won.

Lmaooooooooooo. Thats some I love coffee drinkin teeth.
Same man, but I was up huge so wont complain about tendies
I have no fucking idea what that means for the stock price. Printer goes brrrr brrrr 
I'd still put it in her butt
GUYS THATs WHY YOU SELL BEFORE THE MERGER. THERES MANY EXAMPLES OF SHIT DROPPING POST MERGER. RIDE THE WAVE FOR NOW
why?
No I have ten 5c 1/15/21 so Im not complaining. I just dont understand why its been mooning more than other recovery stocks.
I don't use it myself, but it seems like Zoom will be there for at least the near future, until a competitor makes a genuine dent in their share of the industry pie. I'm okay with dealing with the risk; that's why there's been a recent discount.
CLNE 6c 12/18
Dec 27c just @ me next time
why?? this is my yolo play, and banks have just getting started upwards trend
Moar tendies!!

What is it then haha I assumed it was weed
Can confirm fuck hexo
Bro WHAT. It literally has JUST BEGUN. People were saying this to CIIC as well and look what happened.
I mean on the stocks that matter
Fuck a Wendys, I need a yolo
On what master
We'll see! :) What I'm shorting XPEV is about 2/10 what I made off of PLTR so far.
He wants to be a gay dead bear
Fun
Well, compared to Friday Id call it a rally. Also, anytime the market ends trending upwards I see it as a rally.
Cramer said red Monday , get in Tuesday , up Wednesday.  Haha
I feel you, man.

I picked up 40x 12/11 $177p at open, when we were around $179.50.

Already down about 28%, hahaha.
Like the CIIC pump and dump? Oh
Right there with you brother
Short answer: yes. Get on anything EV asap.
This stonk does nothing but disappoint
Imagine thinking buying spacs close to NAV is risky
Alright, sold me with the last bit.
Like seriously lol
Yes, for .26
Youre good. By the time these retards figure it out, it will be time to sell.
Timing those pumps is a bitch though
How about not working?
Everyone money is tied up in the chiness ev market thought.

That sounds hot, Ill look into it actually
To be honest Id love recommendations that way I can research it more, I just need some where to start if that makes sense
same
Thc party? Shits stagnant. All those people who moved on missed out on50% gains today, plus these 10% after hours.
Done and done
Lmao have you seen CIIC ticker?
Our fund manager will be Mr. Woods Cathie
When the correction happens and 90% of this sub is wiped out again you'll be grateful
Yeah thats what I shouldve done. Instead I just watched it bleed all day.
Yeah dude. What pissed me off is the chart looks like it wants to run. It just cant get through 88. Once it does, its gone. I still have until DEC OPEX so Im good to wait.
Let me ask, are only saying this is a bubble becuase of rapid growth?  

China did say they are banning traditionally fueled cars... that means there is now going to be a new, huge demand for EVs in the worlds larges country. Id say that means theres room for these valuations to be legit. Very forward looking, yes but Im not sure its a bubble.
im up almost $5k on the week but today was bad
Hope so Im 90% cash
Yolo weekly for maximum gains, just put 2k before closing bought at 8.15, 9.50 calls end of week let's goooo
I would be fucking rich in January. 
Yeah i took some profits today and rolled some into calls for next year. Might double down
That's good, at least I'm not a bear
I was in the middle lane
Could be that!
So we should see it bouncing back in a few days I suppose?
TBD
well also we're goin up too fast. If this was slow 0.5%-1% growth it'd probably be more sustainable. This shit is insanity. Big downsies incoming.
I can confirm
FANG makes stuff, yuck
Even though Tesla's like at 520 right now, 420 makes you moist?
ToS has it opening at 17.9 and closing at 18.7 on Friday
Guess Im never visiting Sydney!
Its happening lol
Have fun being a guinea
Me too
After the authoritarianism they showed this year, I never want to go there.
From Australia, living in ny. Can confirm my family is currently having a good time back home with no threat of virus death
I know the timing is suspect. But I just spent some time looking into all of them. XPEV is waaay ahead of NIO and is building a 2nd factory, is already exporting and is growing faster so it should have a bigger market cap. FSR arent even selling cars for 2 years. SOLO makes gocarts.
thanks
Thanks man! Appreciate the advice.
Got it. Thank you.
LMAO
Could have bought a used 911 and set it on fire instead.
Appreciate it brotha
This guy gets it.
Where did he concede?? I cant find link
Markets literally dont care about they shit, its just an excuse for a pump and dump
I have some just not sure if it's worth waiting for a slow down to add more, probably not
Ight bet
Good god what the fuck
Damn sorry bro. Only a matter of time before people realize what they are investing in
I'm actually up 441% just this week from calls. Suck a duck biiiiiitch
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah 

Pick your poison tell me what you do
I got the MST done but for second and third it gets dummy hard
I literally was editing the comment as you posted 
There was COTY DD here on WSB before the fO "incursion." At this point, with the long ass expirations and the fact that his plays have been on decently talked about tickers, I'm pretty sure he's full of shit.
Trump news has triggered the snowflake.
Im 29, snowflake.
Exactly, nothing makes sense. Its actually frightening lol.
BLNK is monthly, others are eow
I thought XPEV would pull back today, but who knows.  Could go either way tomorrow.. sad i sold my position this morning.
Famous last words.
No it wasnt the only real question is if the senate goes blue. If it does thats terrible news and well see a much bigger reaction from the market.
Youve made 50 comments in the past hour, why dont you go outside?
Yeah Im buying unethical lobster tonight.
AH pumped because the white house finally agreed to allow Biden to work with a transition team.

Kind of a weak catalyst for mooning tbh
Yeah I don't think so. If we were gonna straight moon tomorrow, hedge funds would be loading into futures rn. They wouldn't just wait until 2am to be nice and give everyone else a chance to get in first. And they wouldn't give a shit about technicals, either.
I'm not bearish.


Kinda fucking gay to ignore the question I'm asking and just assume everyone is "desperate." Stop being gay, gay. It's gay.
Noted :)
My point exactly
too early to buy puts
lol
100% Biden. I wouldve never got in EV stocks if Trump was re-elected.
Yeah - who is all in on climate change and new policies for that. Looks like anything EV is Bull thru next year. Or until McConnell & big oil fuck it up
obviously a bear
ohhh... had a heart attack almost...
it was tho
Naw I just bought 18k in puts at end of day
No not those shills
Im gonna have to agree. I mentioned getting in on this one last week when warrants were at $1, and all I got were downvotes and ban comments. Something odd up today with all the pumping.
Yes. I forgot to add the sarcasm tag.
[deleted]
I was already marked PDT for a month, but they still let me buy and sell positions, over the weekend they just restricted to only sell
Whats that
You truly believe this pump will last another month +??
Come back to this in two months and see who is printing money and who is broke bc SOLO is at 6
Make that $2,100
Yessir
Econometrics
REKT
Not to get political BUT he isnt just a fascist. Hes also a narcissist.
This is the scariest man on earth, I fess up and he will literally murder my whole family, not to mention fail me for the quarter. I wanna just be like my friend kept spam FaceTiming me on my phone and I tried to decline it or some shit

He just did that with any Chinese stocks tied to Chinese defense.

It's crazy, I sold all my FCEL right before $3 so don't feel too bad.
I knew i never should have gone Gey
Yessir
Nah. Just like a 5 pound one
Gotcha. So HCAC all in :)
Go back to sleep
No
Ban
You were too late
Stupid shit that expires this Friday thats already ITM for NIO, PLTR, and PLUG
I did not foresee 13% days across the board.
Bought 100 shares at 17 dollars now up 56% - reckon i should hold a bit longer or sell tmrw?
Doesnt give the option to buy options
What's so good about that stock
I guess that's probably why? Still though, when XPEV is up nearly 400% since beginning of the month, you'd think similarly alt energy vehicle companies would not be down vs. up. It did go up some today but was just surprised to see how far down it is from peak.
I for sure wish I had traveled today. Pulled out of PLTR and AYRO too soon.
Just sell em to save the rest of us bag holders
Gone for this too. Maybe should've doubled down on this
Good news = market go down because no money printer
Same. I don't think it's going to drop soon. I'd just be weary of buying calls in a few months
Youre from Indiana. Youre banned from life.
I know. I broke my rule and traded on emotions. Fine! I will just buy the damn puts if Im losing my money on calls!
I dont trust the meme ones. My theory is if everyone is shilling it, then it is too late to make money from it. 

Just so hard finding the right ones
We don't do looking at numbers here
I am
If this is peak then we can keep going
Damn I got that number before but I felt like I was wrong the whole time
With that can I bathe myself in tendies juice?
But I want to yolo and lose everything so I can finally be part of one of the boys here!
Thanks Im trying to fit in here
Thank you! I know everyone is calling me stupid as fuck and I get that but Im still amateur as fuck and Im only trying it out because my friend kept telling me to do it. I mean I made some money tho
Whats your PT? Also what was your entry and are you doing shares or options?
you mean like their business or my calls?

Fake trucks for the former, and absolute paychecks for the latter ;)
Yisss...Holding 20x 360c expiring Wednesday.
They're at the same price. FIII another spac with EV target. Unannounced company
Thank you. That's a pretty clear explanation. I'll keep doing research but that's a good starting point.
It was up 20% today
Solo ok ill look into it.
There gonna be pull back. Im not saying it gonna crash. But pullback will happen..
Not sure you understand what happened. Ill probably let it stay that way.

Youre right. Im an idiot!
we call that the Penthouse
Why didnt by THCB order go through then lol, it said it would be executed tmrw morning

Fuck it, seems like it's day one of the meme- the way meme stocks are doing lately, I figure it's worth dipping my toes in at least
This guy is selling his kidneys damn
KNDI! I see no once talking about them and they had a 30% run today on 0 news! Like guys?! You wanna make money on a ev that isn't too expensive for a buy in? KNDI. 1 yes their cars look like shit. 2 This is geared towards China.. they don't give a shit about lifted trucks to compensate for small dicks. 3 I was thinking 20 by end of year but now it seems more like 20 by end of the month.
I know nothing about this company, saw your post, said fuck it and bought the AH dip. Just got home from work and I'm up 25%, over $500. Ill let it it ride into tomorrow. Thanks homie.
what the fuck is eng
You literally buy after hours. Usually instead of good for day, you select ext or whatever. If you're on RH you're shit out of luck I think
> Either blow it all or make so much money you'll be able to buy 50 wives!

I always wondered about the legality of those guys who take it to vegas to intentionally lose it before divorce. Can you get penalized for that or is it risk free since it's technically still a shared asset even though you know you're getting divorced?
I do everything ppl here tell me. Never fails except for tesla battery day but shhhhh we dont discuss that.
How the hell did you time it so perfectly? Youre either full of shit or stupid lucky...lol
Time is your friend with options
I can't risk 1500. I have a wife and bills.
:)
Hippie!  lol

Wait.. shit, *I'm* a hippie.

Call it croquet if you want, Im all in.
Could 100% find this exact quote for the internet during the .com bubble
Bruh of you gonna do that at least do yourself a favor and fomo into FCEL
Thcbw
Hell yes

Let them cook
Webull is wank
Get in while its dirt cheap. Merger is being announced early December
Agreed.  I plan to lock in a position after that period expires.  For now its short term calls on this beast.
I thought it was December?
Theres currently 450 million shares circulating on the market.  There are around 2.5 billion shares that can be sold ... there could be very very heavy selling pressure.
idk. with rh its easy
You're on, CIIC vs thcb death match tomorrow
Jesus Christ dude. Thanks for the thesis...so HCAC?
Yes but itll pop on merger announcement thats coming
Never buy unless there's at least 3 s
Buy THCB and hold
Just don't be last to exit
this guy is why the anti vaxxers exist
Turns out we don't need gold backing the dollar when we can just have aircraft carriers backing it instead.
Amen sir!
ID3X? Grats on your gains today!
Was just looking at that.  Why was it banned?  

And why is what seems to be a ngo a traded stock.
[The Dutch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_history_of_the_Dutch_Republic) started early with floating bonds and equity derivatives to multiply purchasing power. Everyone else was doing it a few decades later
I refer to cursed bear Andrew Lemon of Citron.
Waiting for perfect opportunities is a good one. Im still trying to learn that I dont have to trade every day and after a certain loss in a day I need to walk away so I dont do anything risky to try to undo my loss.
Not me.. I just call myself an idiot and move on..

But, I am way up overall and still try not to spend more than I can save in a month
whats the ticker?
whats the ticker for the wt?
Nice I got in at 10.43 and yea let's hope for 15 this week and then even more in weeks to come
What play do
You have going that is going to result In you giving away 10,000
Thank you 
Oh I agree that why I bought in early. Just never seen these kinds of runs before its crazy!
I know I been creeping wsb for since Feb. Spy is trading sideways right now. Spy made me appreciate this reddit.
seems way too low to me, but what do I know?
Great job hold till January to avoid the taxes and bank off NIO day on January 9th. If you become a millionaire after that and want to gift a poor man a pizza lmk lmao 
I was in heavy with shares and was down over $1,000 within five minutes so I panicked and sold that shit and went into BLNK. Cant believe the movement it had today. +10.95 on 20k of shares was insane
Oh and I sold CIIC at $22 too  shouldve made more but profit is profit
I'm in THCB on a whim, but then I see retarded posts like this and question it.
Its way overextended and has a small float. One big seller can drive the price down considerably. If it goes red on the day tomorrow it will pull back to the $40-41.5 area
Fair enough, but the company isnt bad, I would explain the situation to you but its kinda long, just look at my latest post if you wanna see it
Freaking over 2k though! If we get a run up tomorrow its going to be raining tendies
do the smart thing and move it to leaps
You watched that shit explode into the 20.00 wall and didnt pull the trigger half way through after it was battering that shit down?  What the hell man
Luckily a second wave of Corona can't get us now.
Okay i did it
I cashed out today for 50% gain from shares I bought friday and sold this morning
Exactly. If the DD is right then this could run up the same way CIIC did. We just need to be patient
Nice, should be ITM by Christmas.
As long as you're having fun!
They are flipping shit over PLTR going up 4$ imagine when they see shitcoin all over the news on CNN Fox talking about shitcoin going parabolic cause it broke ATH, and FOMO is like 2017 x15 and institutions buy in. (Refer back to this comment in a couple months when Shitcoin is 50k +
NIOs not even crazy parabolic yet.

Spiking to 80-90 will be the scary zone
Good thing I dont need a 20% gain on the stock just a nice 2-3% in one day I would shit myself
Tough Love, unfortunately. All my shit are premium plays that started 10% OTM. All practically ITM. Farcical. 

So goes Meme-apocapalooza. 
Yellen news got people rollin.
Since Thursday almost definitely. Pretty much every itm call is up +500% today.
Yup and sold friday at 10.50 cause it was getting shorted  , but this rally was really unexpected
Spreads also very decent
Another tip: Focus on what the market IS doing, not what it SHOULD be doing.

It sounds like you're hyper focused on what the market is supposed to be doing. That's fine if you're Buffet and you're comfortable holding a stock for years or decades. But it's gonna break if you're not a very long term investor.
All the BRRR money is in bank reserves for potential loans. It's not floating around in the economy.
nice :) only got 100 and 1000
My brother told me about it, hes going long on every EV stock he can get his hands on and is all about the SPAC trend. Ive done very, very little research on it, just whipped a hundred bucks at 10 shares to roll the dice
Missed the part where you said FD. I think youll be fine. Has to rebound.
Oh I know.  Im long on it.  I don't think its gonna hit 50 next month though.  I'd be awfully happy if it did though lol
2 of those you mentioned ain't EV
Dude Im sorry to hear but also slightly glad Im not the only one that gets fucked on AAPL. Or used to Im done with it.
Shit it was at 275 at open today  but yes, lets hope it continues to rise
I wish 
Good shit, Im up 87%
Ok just transferred another 5k. I'll toss 10 total at it when they all clear if I don't miss it
For real?
One of us
Finished today up $16,164.64 lol they would not believe it cus it looks funky as shit

If things go well, should net 20k plus Tuesday (the AH is killing it already)
I think the trend will continue up, but it's up 18% in 3 weeks. 

I'm just trying to catch the 5% retrace.
Thanks you....
Shouldve sold at $119
You may be right, but Ill still profit take. Good luck.
[deleted]
Bought 12/18 $230c around 10:20 and sold them around 11:40. Couldve probably pushed it a little higher if I waited till right before close. I got kind of lucky and called the bottom, but I also watched the nasdaq and saw MSFT was underperforming the index and had no real reason to keep sinking. Wasnt sure if it would turn green, but I was confident it would bounce from where it was sitting. I bought 12/18 so it would have time to recover if it ended up staying low today. I day trade MSFT pretty often though so I think I have at least some sense of how it trades.
Aint no car company. Unless you talking about SOLO
for regular stonk, what about ev? all that matters is ev
LOL
Lol all good

More cause for it to shoot above $20 in the short term tho

One of the few meme plays I actually kind of like, as a shares play
as long as you don't touch yourself
trillion dollar company and the stock is on sale, easy buy
Sold 3 Tsla calls and bought shares. So, same thing. Thank you for caring.
fuck it bro, they wont understand i know mine wont either if i told them how much of this shit costs. They would never spend $100 on stox, fuckin boomers put it in savings
nice im trying to help with my moms dental work
You'd see a lot more posts with actual research behind them, but honestly they were no more accurate than placing trades based upon a coin flip or which side of the yard that guy's dog poops on.

Nobody can really predict the market on a short timeframe.
Nice one ty. No ciic?
I shall order the new iPhone 12 to help the your cause. We are stronger in numbers!
Definitely better dont try to time the top thats how you get burned
Wait it out a little to gains will come
Lmao best of luck to you. Were enemies but youre not bad.
The vaccine gave us a green week retard
Been doing this for 2 years. I-I think I have a problem, but its a profitable addiction.
But how about when you go all in? Or do you not?
&#x200B;

I have shares and nov 27 14C
Have you ever heard of sarcasm
you mean why it pumped before news came out?
I think its probably healthier long term to have a president that doesnt directly manipulate equities on Twitter
I haven't noticed much difference between the two and wouldn't expect much to change. I just wanted to point out that you're an idiot.
GROUND CONTROL TO SQ 300!!!
But not two days. The logic is, why would tons more people buy tomorrow after a 15% day when they could have bought today?
just look how we mentioned thcb and it fucking pumped 10%....
It's hard having a good balance between caution and "fuck it"
Im not an equity analyst and I have a real job
you can call me Ms. Wood
PLTR TO THE MOOOOOON!!!!!!
Not trying to be an ass, but what did you expect? Love him or hate him, thats his character.
Did you smash though...
oh fuck you can only buy shares??

Booooooooring
Certain things apply but yeah pretty much. My Etrade is dedicated to SPAC warrants. Up 80%! SBE.WS went from 4 to 13 in like 3 days. I randomly threw 50 at it now its up 140% lol. And robin hood doesn't have warrants, Idk what you used but you should know that.
You bet!
If you remember the PRPL guys that's how they started.. like 50-100k in warrants under $2 now they're 25-30 a pop and the guys have a couple million
Wanna sum up the key points for THCB? I'm in FSR.WS and those are their terms. I'm giving a hypothetical. Of course the company can call them it but if they're called that means the warrants are already positive.
I have the same calls, not much movement the last few weeks but I think its worth the wait
You belong here
I do be a little tho tbh
True.
Because. You only decide who dies and who succeeds by a review of financial status more or less. The best do not always live. Only those that had wealth passed to them or weren't born utterly poor af.

There is an ugly head of capitalism. It's the one in which accrued weath transfer matters more than earnings of wealth. 

There are people born poor that would smoke the living shit out of the boys born rich if given the same playing field you know.

Capitalism shows its fault lines when considering inherent wealth.
I got 100
Yeah, I dont think theyre  on rh.
I'm glad you have found solace here. Somewhere between my losses and the shitty memes I've found happiness here
I'd get it if they made some kind of major announcement but they literally haven't done anything. Not to mention shares are currently trading at like 130x EPS, no way this is sustainable.

I predict a massive sell-off incoming.
I have 12/4 19p for .95 cr 18.05 cost basis 5 contracts. $475 cr on 9.5k capital.
KNDI just did that last week.. and yet today they are up 30% alone. Shits crazy and doesn't make since but since my money is in them I can't complain about their astronomical gains in such a short time.
I felt like a genius after that sell off it had, now look at the thing run
Evil shall always win because good is dumb.
Not afraid of the investigation consequences?
Hell yeah bro totally understand. Good luck to you
Ill be back... in 5 min...
That's my speculation. See how GM is moving up the charts? Even they are going all in on EVs. Sounds like the Stimmy will be centered around renewables.
()
Still took 200%+ profit, paper hands holding a company I don't know squat about
I would be happy with either. :D
Oh fuck yeah I picked up 11/27 550c eod
Finance then obviously
I know - I just hate that fokin stock 
ahhh that's on my list still haven't tried it
I'm a big scotch enthusiast too. Dude, I toured the Laphroaig distillery last year and tried the 30. It was fucking amazing. I aaaaaalmost bought a bottle for only 600 pounds (750 dollars?) But I would have needed to go through scotland customs and then Italy customs cause I was going there next.

Port Ellen was amazing. Loved it
I go to ucla
Bruh
up 15% AH tho
But yet its also a high I dont want to depart.
Dw i did the same when crsr hit 32. 1.8k gains vs >10k if i held
There were a few dips. When it didnt moon for a couple of secs. Thats the dip fool
I'm confident, I don't see much more upside in CIIC
Both, my retarded ass thought selling a covered call was a good idea because it was having resistance at $20, will prob sell that and roll into a debit spread for a little extra $$$ on my shares as this shit moons, maybe by a couple calls as lottos as the year comes to an end.

Edit: majority shares
I just bought 1k in shares, wish I went margin though considering I shorted NIO today on impulse and now feel like ill never see that money again  Honestly I won't be able to give you a good answer this shit has ran up a lot so we are really just gambling at this point with options IMO (like I am w nio). Id wait for a dip but i could also look like a retard if this this pops another 15-20% this week
Thanks
Thank you, seeing it now. They bought 460,000 shares for ARKG
GLDM for me.  Love me some ETFs.  Don't belong.
First ones free
Yup!!
Ok were making progress  what did you buy?
This is the way, calls baby
I dont remember doing it but apparently I hit snooze enough times on my alarm to wake up 2.5 hours late to the party
 i just bought 15k in shares and idk what warrants are XD
Its the same dude who told us about CIIC
Nooooo not PLUG! Damn it now I have to sell.
I was on the boat, mad I'm not on as much.
Lol, I was just reading his tweets.  What a man child.
THCB is the new new
You can sell them at any time on the open market. They trade just like stocks. If you chose to keep them, then they have an expiration date where you have to convert to shares. They also sometimes come with an early redemption clause if the stock holds over a certain price for a certain amount of time. But you can still sell them even then without redeeming them.
Autism = savant. Dont be a retard, embrace your gift
This is one stock to be bullish as fuck on. Definitely keep those shares for a couple years. Youll be rolling in it. I only wish I wasnt a broke bitch so I could buy shares instead of calls on this
I'd cash out any calls and take the profit assuming you didn't just fomo into today it in which case godspeed.

If you still want to try to ride the wave, hold shares until it starts to dump and jump ship. That's just me.
we dont have RH in the uk ffs
I mean, Ive got shares but only like 10 because Ive been buying so much PLTR
None pussy, made 13k off the iPhone event and havent touched it since. You?
Will do, thank you for the link.
I think I will finally be able to pay my rent.
fucking christ bro buy yourself a ps5, praying for your tendies tomorrow :). i almost bought a small amount of contracts today, fomo gonna hit me hard :)
Thank you
Thank you
searching for THCB it looks like a SPAC for cannabis not EV...
Cant get around the PDT - but they have a little flexibility.
If you held apha, man, you would've been more Gucci than half this sub
https://www.marijuanamoment.net/congress-will-vote-on-federal-marijuana-legalization-next-month-house-leadership-announces/

Albeit biased, this is the potential rumor. Im betting on it at least for a run up. APHA is my play as it also has earnings so any January call will hopefully be a cheap lotto ticket 
Yeah given the stimulus I am long term bullish. Selling weeklies to avg down my cost for now
Look at the [1yr for GDX](https://i.imgur.com/S2fV6M2.jpg) (zoomed), serious deflating going on... Testing June levels
Wowza
THCB seems more pump and dumpy to me. HCAC has been a sleeper for sometime. Think I might buy more HCAC tomorrow but already holding a ton
Tickers pls
So much money on the line, trillions$$$
I dont have the capital to buy a lot of shares so i need options
Thats right. Read the letter RC sent to management just a few days ago. This was done tactically and threatens management to get their shirt together and forces them to show proper guidance for this coming Q3 earnings, while simultaneously threatening to buy them out (he currently owns a 10% stake)
Huh. Interesting note.
Nope Im diversified into clean energy, EV and spy as well as some brick and mortar blue chips. JS read the balance sheets
Bang em anyway then earn enough money and upper tier will come to you. Watch it play out its funny
I like the cut of your jib.
At this point, its a rat race for the small amount of EV companies popping up to show who can actually put together a solid vehicle with demand and get that small niche of market share and keep building from there. NIO seems good. Fisker seems okay but I invested just to ride the overall hype and see where it takes me.
Ya - Im in AYRO, MARA, EG, KCAC .... when money is this easy (70% in a day across the whole portfolio on stocks) it feels like disaster will strike. 

I feel better removing initial float right now. 

My biggest positions are AYRO and MARA and I actually have faith in them as businesses. The others are purely gambling. I took out my initial capital and am now happy to let the race horses run.
Buy shares and sell calls, downside isnt as large and with these 40%+ days you still make gains
Profit is profit. If you weren't comfortable losing as much as you put into shares, your position is fine. 

You should feel good about yourself!
Wow thought this sub was only retards
Id be make so much fucking money
What lol?
"Going to somehow" lmao

Check out which SC judge presides over which state's circuits and reach out to me on December 10th
I could see senate pitching a shit fit and possibly not confirming, but Yellen is decently well liked so even that is unlikely.
I vote we do the Guatemala thing if they try.
Always different this time. The last time it wasnt was last time.
This guy gets it
Yeah, that's why I don't really want to buy in, yet.
Pretty big army contract was announced last week tho
Do i buy calls?
What about the army contract last thursday?
1. pick a strike a week or two out that's trading for around $1 (e.g. 364C 12/2 or 346P if you like to play puts, this strat works both ways)
2. watch for a direction in the first 30 min of trading (try not to buy-in, I always have a hard time with this)
3. depending on how swift the movements up/down you'll see the contract fluctuate by .30-.40c in either direction (keep an eye on the SPY candles and look for key pivots - gaps, resistance, support levels.
4. buy as many contracts as you feel comfortable getting into but leave yourself plenty of room to double or triple down (with 10K I'd start with 5-10 contracts at a time).
5. Get out when you're up 5-10%, rinse/repeat
6. Don't hold overnight unless you want to get cut in half

Been doing this for about 6 weeks now, closed up 5K today and 40K over the last 6+ weeks of doing this
I'm assuming anyone in here buying options is generally not concerned with ST gains. That said, I do this in my rollover 401K so it's tax sheltered
Me too but need to grab moar before it goes back up.
Actually yeah dude send it
It is still mooning in after hours. I think its heavily dependent on EV market so if in morning hours EV continues strong, its a sure bet to break $10
2-4 Months, depending on how many price upgrades, holiday catalysts and continued momentum continuew to push it higher and higher. I did the DD on it and its fundamentals are phenomenal and it generates over 1B in revenue per year and steadily growing. Id' listen to their earnings call to further support this statement btw.

Currently holding a couple shares and a 55c 1/15/21 up 61.56% rn
Because Im jealous of you having 18k to put into a play
Odds are, you are dumb, so anything you do, by definition, is dumb
Because the market keeps rising on the worst news. Another vaccine pump tomorrow and your puts are finished.
haha same - saw they were trending on yahoo finance then saw EV in the title of an article and insta-bought lol
It was on WSB posted Friday or Saturday
The top one is the one that I saw. Idk if its right or not
100 miles is 160.93 km
Yes. Hyundai partnership + skateboard platform. Do some dd and youll be hyped to jump in.
Doesn't matter what a stock's "worth" as long as someone is buying.
It uses a different sales model than tsla, more like leases and rental so it can stand on its own.
Keep me in your dms friend if you figure anything out
sucks for bag holders
I lost $3000.
It should go back up eventually
Let's get it.
Ill FOMO in no matter what. Im a degenerate and this bitch is moving
$500 got you stressin?
Maybe it's an EV company that delivers weed
Theres 3 1/2 trading sessions left in the month
Lol, I did the same during the drop.  Made so much on puts that I kept buying them when the market went up.  Good luck to you.  Im long on palantir.  11/19/21 $35c
Buy it 
No. If youre feeling froggy though, buy warrants.
Dont bet against us!!
Playing the shutdown, earnings run-up and holidays during Covid. ZM is ubiquitous these days with video calls + new lockdowns on the way. I dont see it as a bad play and Im already up 70%. I just expected to see $500 soon not down a few points.
Thinking of selling some in dec just in case of rug pull. Also chose this based off of open int on friday
get a new platform
Not hating I'm impressed
CLNE $5c 1/15/21
Easily worth twice as much as its current valuation
Even shares are printing

They're all scam companies. Any Chinese EV
You're going for the big money. 1/21 410 for me
Apparently lol. I got out of my GM leaps way too soon. But I got MJ instead so that's looking nice for tomorrow.
If ZM opens red tomorrow Im going to switch to something else
EASA wont move the stock. They got bigger issues.
You aint even playing bro
*covered calls
so you don't know either
Who knows? Im just preparing mentally. When you go in without a plan your emotions will take over, and that can screw you. If its up 1% then ride it out, if its up more than 2% then sell at open. Make a plan like that.
Aye nice i'm on the BABA monthlies. Both should be bullish
I'm ok with that my calls exp 2022 and I bought at 4.xx
Yeah theyre poosys
Nah I got in at 10.43 for stock and warrants
What u holding?
theres warrants @ thcbw

Yea I'm hopeful, not optimistic. 

Prayers to everyone's tendies. 
That is what I have read in threads marked DD...... so it must be true.
Bro, it's not our fault that ur dumb as fuk
Im definitely watching them. You think it has more upside than THCB?
Is there a max In Roth?
Ahh ok well you should still be able to get in at a good price after it drops a bit at open.  I'll be adding then as well
I just can't bring myself to do it. 

I have 12/11 IWM $177p's, and also some 3/19 IWM $150p. I was hoping to dump them both around $163 (which seemed a logical place to pull back to when we were consolidating at $173). 

So far, not a good move. 

Might ditch them all on Dec 9 and YOLO into some 15% OTM AMC weeklies.
Butterfly network its medical imaging sector like ultrasounds
We're not marrying this EV shit.  Its more like a booty "call"
Already got 100 shares of Mara and riot brother Im ready for the shitcoin party
AMA
Kinda missed the train. Bought in @18.36 but couldve gotten in at 18. Gains are gains. Would love to see it hit $20 tomorrow
I bought at close when it got below $21 for $21c exp 12/11

Its going up a dollar a day, so its easy to hedge and get out at the end of the day or next day
My bad, I meant the $20 call
You're doing the same thing by saying EV is in a bubble.
NIO has been my baby since August I will but calls every week
I'm a retard and don't know what that means. 
Edit: I used "the google" i now see I've been a theta head for a year now.
I had 5x 26.5p expire worthless on Friday. I was basically certain it would drop and print but fuck no. Only a $350 loss though
Can you hold till lockup ends?
Bp, Shell, XOM beaten down boomer stonks
yeah i never put too much money into weeklies because they're so risky but you can make a lot from a little
How many contacts did you sell and for what credit ? Trading at 2.3k rn
Ev batteries get off rh
It's not cannabis, it's EV battery co, and a really good one at that. Robinhood description is retarded
not sure how I feel about the warrants but I understand the appeal. I took 10 May 2021 calls for $12.50 strike. small position because it's very speculative. But seems like HCAC is far more rooted in fundamentals than some of these other EVs
We are actually about 4% out. It could actually go there lol fuck. Im break even at 560 at the end of the week. And ur around 555 I assume? Worst case I guess if they get called away we can buy on a dip. 555 and 560 are very achievable prices to get back in at.
Warrants for a dollar offer similar leverage and the opportunity to go to 0 we all love
warrants
I bought into lithium miners instead.  Up a pretty healthy chunk on those already so really hard to be too terribly upset.
Attaboy
riding the hype train... all stonks are stupid over valued...
never said it "would" i said it "could"
Puts are to unpredictable for me right now. I rather put long term in ARKF or something. I was long On blnk and saw it hitting a mid 30 price at some point. Not in a day though
Me too and XPEV
Gonna keep on holding for now. Good luck brother
Idk how it works but its showing the cake thing next your name. Either way... BABA calls
Buy high sell low
I feel ya!
Im playing feb calls, strike prices based off of highest open interest. Seen a lot of dec calls tho
I've been in for months but other stocks like gap have fully rebounded, kss still 40% behind 52 week high and was much higher a year and a half ago.  Had a good q3 and has been on tear since.  I added a couple of slightly oom options 2 weeks back and am up a ton.  Its 1/3 of my portfolio which is all high upside imo.  Other 2/3 are airlines and cruises.
I did with my first covered calls at 45. I bought in at 26 for 1k so I guess I don't mind the free cash flow



I tell myself
Ah, gl. I lost 1 or 2k on ER last quarter even though it was positive. Not playing this one but hope it goes well!
I stopped. Thats whats brought me down
2017 - INTC

2018 - AMD

2019 - TSLA

2020 - TSLA, AMD, BABA, JD, GME

I usually pick one stock and just all in.
Lol nooo youre furry and like honey ! 

So far this year I meant. My best is +300% on FB 300c back in august
i think that's kind of already understood.
Bought 5 calls for dec 18  today in the morning almost ITM, up 30%
Theres a lot more to a union than them just havjng your back if you do something stupid. Great healthcare coverage with most at free to very low deductibles. Free classes. College Tuition reimbursement. Daycare reimbursement. And more
Plus your most likely not going to get all the benefits of union. Like pension, annuity, paid healthcare....
True
Well, Im feeling sick the other way after blowing $80k in 2 weeks.

Glad someone is making out well - great job my guy.
Hell of a job! Remember to take risk off the table. Youre a millionaire!!!
fr? lmaoooooo thats cold asf
What are u gonna do with that?
That's why u set stop losses on the way up dummy
pump n dumpers. Its very low volume so it may actually be working
I tend to block stocks from memory specially the ones i sold low :) I had bought it at 10.3 and sold it at 16 ish 
My man.
Exactly.
Yeah it lead the market today. Its not mutually exclusive, it also has outperformed the market 3:1 in November. Unsustainable frankly
PAYPAL CEO SAYS SO.
Any press release that has to do with EV, doesn't even have to be real and it will moon.
As long as its 30+ by end of December im good :)

Oh my god, I hope tomorrow is bloody just for you.
Gyna, EV Bus, Graphite, Meme
you will get 5k in the morn, congrats
Well I know where my last $30 of buying power is going
Type HCAC into the WSB search bar. Youll find a few solid dds. This ones been under the radar so far but about to break out
How? I'm new to Reddit as well bro
Or the fact that it seems too logical to happen is exactly why it will happen. Either way Im holding these SPXS hedge calls with enough cash to exercise until they expire in January.  Gives me the peace of mind to keep making these illogically profitable bull plays Ive made over the past week.
Lol all my PLTR tendies went into THCB
Hard to say.  They are hot right now though.  Wait a little while after opening bell to see what they do if you need to.
Thats was my first ever contract.. whoops. I bought mad PLTR calls at open today so
I got 3 just to be safe 
bro I'm up 600% it just started running like on Thursday
Much higher. 15 by then. Guaranteed.
Ahh can you read? I was asking who they were merging with? Of course I know what a spac is lol
Yea, realistically, profit is profit so enjoy your money and delete the ticker unless you plan on getting back in. Arrival (the company that is merging) is actually a very good company and backed heavily by solid companies, so Im bullish long term
Sold my SBE on the dip this morning a little sad now but got out up 100% on my shares. Can't complain.
Lol... Have a real brokerage account?

I use 3 brokers.
Done. I would sell but then again Im a degenerate
ty ty - I'm all in on PLTR in shares, so I love this news.
Stonks go up
Don't jynx it
Calls. All in
Always better than a loss! Keep your head up champ
CIIC is a blank check dude
CIIC was at thcb price level last week dude
It's up 2 percent for the day, boomer
At this rate for another year I will be richer than space Karen guy
Idk msg Pfizer CEO on LinkedIn
Michigan and the GSA news, yes.
I can do that after they sell my shares?
Congrats on the gains
Big mistake, get it while its hot. Best time to buy is around 1 pm eastern time.
You don't have to chart, just trust me, we're on WSB
That's a good one, you're gonna have a much higher mark change relatively, should be itm real quick if this growth continues into Black Friday
WE GOING TO THE MOON BABY! I was disappointed when I bought at 13.80 and was like I coulda time at 13.50 but :) WHO CARE WE going to the MOON.
I would pick a further expiration but whatever floats your boat man. Im in for January
No problem, also my buddy told me about another one GMHI
Atta boy
Not bad. BoL man!
I don't get it :( never read the gambler is he being sarcastic lol
Took out 3X cost basis and rolled up half of the remainder already.  I think we've got a few more days of pump.
$10k, doubt I hit millionaire off that but I'll take any mad gains
Bought them at 0.85, sold some at 1.50 and the rest at 1.00. Not the most exciting play ever but a wins a win. If youre bullish on banks JPM is the best one to buy calls on IMO, the price moves pretty well when it gets going compared to some other banks.
There won't be herd immunity until next year at the earliest and I still think some serious lock downs are coming but yeah maybe its the play.  Shit I am no fortune teller.

Nice. What kind of percent gain have you seen? I am holding $7 1/15/21 calls right now but might roll them out.
I dont plan on executing the option
I cashouts my 17.50, 20, 21.50 and $30 calls on PLTR. Up $8k on the week. Im now going to sell puts on SPCE and RKT
Hey you could always turn your call into a spread by selling the 525c. You got this brother. Papa Musk won't let you down.
Especially since gov spending and the potential for inflation will increase.
lol
LETS KEEP IT MOVING
What's the damage
That's pretty normal. Futures are up by much less than that.
Do your research before talking.
How are they becoming a tech company?
Bro I'm not victim blaming lmao. I really feel you should expect these idiot companies to fuck up now in days. If I have something to do I give it a week in preparation because if I let it come down to the line, 9/10 times I get fucked.
Sure for the long term, but retards like me cant understand more than a week out
Link?
Just set tight stop losses and enjoy the ride
kk :) I have AAPL too from buying near end. It'll be ok
I yolod everything into HCAC already lmao
Believe it or not people don't remember every single play.

I was part of some of the ultra memes and I don't remember any of them to be honest.
The option losers are the easy ones for me. Once it loses 50% of the value, its gone.
Already happened.
We see
Leggo! 
Thank you. Mr mandalorian please keep my money safe.
That is not a range bound asset lol
Close legit couldn't have been more neutral.

AH pumping on the Biden news. Time will tell if it turns into a legit rally, or if the algo pump just fades. Kinda fading rn.
Oh ok
Im here to tell you its ok, join us, not saying never buy puts, but only when its so blatantly obvious something is irrationally too high too fast
I would say like 6 months. But people here would probably say more like 3.
Luckily I held, only due to being out of RH day trades. Looks like tomorrow well recover but nothing like the gains posted here today from every meme stock on the planet.
NIO earnings, whole sector moving up. UK banning gas cars by 2030, China shifting toward EVs heavily, GM doubling down and going in on EVs
News reports are saying 12/10 but it can come +- 4 days
Bro it's over $5 right now wdym
Most people on the planet have no idea what VHCOL means.
Tbh I would wait for a solid down trend before buying puts. It's better to miss some profit than lose a bunch before it actually goes down. These stocks are way too hot right now. XPEV could reach $100+ before dropping to like $80. Even the your puts will already lost most of it's value. Trust me, I tried this with SNAP and got fucking owned
In my experience when UVXY was naturally going down it decayed faster than the covered call premium died, and of course when it shoots up your gains are capped so really I felt like I was selling the only good reason to hold those shares which is a quick spike in volatility. If youre long volatility I would just hold the shares without the covered call, and would not recommend holding longer than a few days to a week
Tell me about it lol I lost 1600 on it
Sell in the morning, buy back in the afternoon. EZ
*gasp*
Bruh
Watch what it does tomorrow. If its able to hold  above 10.5 then your timing might be bad. If it gaps down and tests 9 again then you might be onto something. I have 9p 11/27 lottos. If it punches through 9 Im loading up on 1/21 7p.
Is there any news or anything? I aint complaining but shid
I just took initial capital out. My gambles are up almost 200% so Im still in for more than I started with and even if things go tits up Im cash to buy the dip.
ye i had 1k that i sold for fat profit, now i only have 100 for fun lol
because they are pretty much fcel but havent run yet
Yes except it bled until $9 from 18 for days on end when other stocks were going parabolic. Good times.
Good call, yea im still ptsd from sept 2 too, i lost 30k in gains, and now im up 32k in gains lol. If u see vix futures mooning with futures thats a bad sign and thats pretty much what i learned from that since then. Take profits when u can ofc
I traded apple,zoom, qqq,cost,nio,tsla but now in tsla playing the s&p
Yeah, i got duped 2x by thinking this 1bn buyback would somehow cause it to moon.
a lot of internet coins are going vertical, shitcoin as slowed down
my trigger will be if we start killing the dollar with stimulus and caving to gina.  anything that kills the dollar helps gold. i dont think we will see summer 2020 gold rocking a second time unless we really go hog wild with stimulus.
Sell @ open .05 less than bid
That was a smart move I tried to be a bit more conservative and lost out on a ton of value.  Still can't complain and may buy some short term otm ones too.  Keep stacking that cash
SPAC about to merge with a Chinese EV battery company.
Ya that makes sense

F, I'm here for you babe
GSA signed off on the presidency transition to Biden. Its as close to conceding.
As many as trump wants it
Thats gonna be a hell yeah from me dog. BMW maintenance is a bit higher than an avg car but itll be a fun drive
So due diligence and dont just trust a random ding dong on Reddit - but after reading about them and checking their website I felt good about riding. 

I took some gains today just to recoup my initial capital but Ive been riding this up from high 2s and expect it to hit north of 500M in the short term and could tickle a billy before the Karma deal finishes in 2023. 

Basically - Im bullish until it hits what I think is properly valued.
I would probably mainly get shares, but if you get options, get the furthest ones out and ITM.
That is fair. Very fair
Thats now referred to as Toobing
Sector rotation. Money is flowing out of tech to boomer shit, evs, n weed. Tech is running out of steam. Will be flat / down for a while imo
Cause it cheap? Too early to tell we will see tomorrow morning pre market
Itll die by the end of the month retard every game gets big numbers on release
Gods fake bro lol Stonks only go up
Vaccine news was in the AM AZN. Treatment news, Regeneron and trump pretty much conceded. Rumors of Novavax soon too

Unemployment and everyone stopped paying rent months ago. And for months they were getting an extra $600 a week on top of state unemployment. Theres plenty of money. No ones going hungry.
Sell just before. Easy 300%
Let's make this money
[DD Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzkpv1/i_made_the_dd_on_ciic_last_week_now_i_am_moving/)
Yeah. But that ran from 10 to 25. Sure it might have more room to run, but Ill bet on THCB as it has more room to run.
God bless you. May your pocket book over floweth.
Gotcha. Was like -4% though. My calls lost some $
My family is doing ok too. 
I agree with the thesis mostly but just shitting on you for hindsight bias
Take that from a guy who has a mortgage after renting for the first thirteen years of leaving my parents home.  It would be great to have a home halfway paid off, or just to have the capital to upgrade.

I'm happy now, but it would have made things slightly better.
I sold at 44 for break even and I sold SBE at 30.50 for 100%. Aim small miss small. One step at a time brother!
Bitch, why you whining then? Im up a lot too, not fucken selling
Theres DD for literally every stock on WSB, theres 1.5 million dumbasses here. Think what you want, but you gotta admit that he at minimum does the hard work of sorting thru the BS here to find good plays
Disagree with you on there not being a non-zero chance. however small the % might be, it was there, and that's uncertainty, and you know what markets hate! I agree with you on the senate being huge for market sentiment.
... ummm only commented like 10x, maybe don't go counting other peoples comments and take your own advice. Boomer
Because it's a hot potato. They're all the same side but nobody wants to be first. But sure enough someone always buys
Your just going around the thread acting increasingly desperate in each comment I see man, have a drink and go to bed.
It is literally a new world.
Fuckery incoming.
obviously :)
Bro who the fuk is a perma bear? Play the market son. Sunday night I was a hardcore bear then switched to calls this morning when I saw bears r ded.
lmao someone is *ABOUT TO BE* broke
Then you are a lucky Diamond handed fella.
You probably made a day trade. Did you send out a sell order AH on Friday? Options was technically closed but sometimes it still counts that as a day trade of the AH market is open. Still wouldve given you a warning though. I think it bans you if you send it through, not if it actually completes it.
If you day trade while on PDT that's what happens.
Google it
Some of these will dump, and some of these will continue on. SOLO will probably dump, Chinese EVs will probably keep chugging along imo.
Agree SOLO is stupid.
Still cucked haha
Nice! Lot of money in that field if youre interested in pursuing it. Id fail that test like mfer though now. Been a decade since I studied it.
Well maybe you can kill him with kindness
Yeah that makes sense because of conflict of interest of the US military. But he can't just outright ban all chinese stocks for no reason. This ain't an authoritarian country
i shorted it and immediately got destroyed.. also fukin LI, chinese algos fukin killin it !
huh
oof 
Who knows dude. I got in at 49 and whoa it has retard strength. Fully convinced Elon talking shit got it on a lot of peoples radar.
PLTR is strictly a diamond hand stonk.  Allah willing.
2778 and ban him back to 4th grade math. # of shares \* price
You cant be. Its physically impossible.  You would forget to breathe
bro same, I started on friday, and I'm up over $100, feels good. no worries
I got in around 10.38, and I'm just sticking with shares. Given the pump we're seeing with clean energy, I wouldn't be surprised if it ran up to at least $28 over the next week or so. IMO, it's a long term hold
I cant believe it's still going lol

Only Robinhood closes at 6
Sigh...
Aaaaaaight
A money printer. Hope on before its too late!
But then wouldnt you just be buying it at the open price tmr?
Then wtf are you here lol. I have wife and kids and actually gamble
I think I read something in that they can't sell until after the first earnings report, which would put it mid q1 2021.  I honestly don't know where to find that info, so I'd take what I say with a grain of salt as I cant double check.  Hopefully some wsb detective could find it.

Gl either way
When is that coming big dog
A tale as old as time
Thank u bb 
Not sure why its banned on this sub. Maybe because its a pennystock, but it does have options too
And my guess is that everything went swimmingly without any serious repercussions?
Same tickers with a W at the end
I have 7,000 12/24 SPY 400c average $0.15. 370 would give me a profit of 200k
The interpretation of the columns might not be clear. Basically, the neutral column is derived from comments that mention the ticker but don't specify a sentiment. If you look at PLTR, you will see that 32% are bullish and only 9% are bearish, meaning the bulls *greatly* outnumber the bears. Those two sentiments only add up to ~41%. The rest of the comments mentioned PLTR but without an obvious sentiment so 59% are neutral. Hope that clears it up.
im planning on it. message me when NIO hits 200$ and ill buy you a pizza.
Sell me your cheapies I want some more
So what youre saying is to buy the dip?
Will do. Im always open for some dd. Thanks
Thank you for reminding me that is still quite a bit of money lol. Lose perspective on the YOLOs sometimes.
I had 19c I bought at open I sold for like 65% profit and rolled into these, settle down guy I can do more than one trade in a day
The market doesn't seem to care about Covid anymore. It's old news.
Nice man. I just bought in as well.
bro thats over a month from now, should onky be a few weeks of daily +20%
Don't worry I sold below 60 too
Thank you again. I didnt expect to actually get help here but I needed to hear this.
Yes, I know it's not as simple as I characterized it, but there has been a great deal of loan activity that's actually deploying the funds through PPP lending, other SBA loans, tons of new and refinancing of business and real estate mortgage debt, and so on. Per Freddie Mac, borrowers are taking out more equity as cash than at any point since 2009.  Tons of that money is going back into the market in various ways.
i know i  didn't say they were. just was talking about them in addition to the evs
If it opens at 275 I make a $1k so Ill take it lol
What you in?
I dont have profit to take so yeaa
It's the WSB darling EVs and small tech plays that are on a blowup trajectory. Billion dollar valuation with two million in revenue is stupid no matter what the fiscal policy.
Beats me. EV will do its own thing. Today a bunch of boomer shit pumped. Tomorrow they will get dumped.
I thought it was still cheap up around 320 in all honesty
Haha. Ive been there. Hit real big a few times in a row and start thinking, "damn, Im good at this"

Luckily, I usually cash out a good chunk and save it or buy something cool
what plays ya in friend? best of luck
I sold today at 24. Sucks to be me, but it's okay, had 60% profit
lmao i dont even own a single apple product. Tim Apple cursed me, if my call prints massively ill buy one tho as tribute.(very unlikely...117$ call 10 buys, weekly lul).
Dont make fun of my small money please.
U hopping in?
Actually, the realized vs. implied vol spread gave us green, but no, it was certainly Biden. Objectively. Youre off in a lot of ways here, all due respect. Market loves Biden. Always has. Bet the house on Biden due to what I was seeing in sectors the week before.
no
Oh shyt
But our gains?
Lol
This is what I was thinking,  also.  Why are these soyboys taking about something else?
Surely hes got to break character at somepoint, he cant be a moldy orange testicle crying wolf all the time, surely? 

Hes got to just lay down and take it in the butt, like a real child of god.
I use schwab so I'm in. Quick question, for THCBW, I see the SEC docs say $11.50 strike as your comment does. But schwab listing for THCBW says "TUSCAN HOLDINGS C 26 WTSWARRANTS EXP 04/01/26"

What is the 26?
There is usually a clause like stock price above $18 for x days and warrents must be exercised in 30 days or they are redeemed for 0.01

5 years is the maximum time, but most successful spacs hit the target much earlier. So its not at all like a 5 year leap option.
i sold some too but then got back in and then CNBC just keeps pumping it everyday and away we go!
Not in this case 
What investigation consequences?

EDIT: Just saw thank you for bringing to my attention. I think the case will be dropped when investors see the stock rise. Not worried about it.
Like thats real good for my portfolio n all imma make a nice chunk of cash but not a fan of no green new deal that shits gonna rack up the debt like never before and long term fuck us all while we could stimmy even more with that money or just bloody hold it
Nice. Jealous
BRB loading up the car like the beverly hillbillies
Any reason for that over GLD?
Not sure why its not showing. PLTR!
I meant the ticker name THCB, not the guy who did the dd the other day.
Nobody is making posts about that
I really believe in the company is a Unicorn with a huge moat around their government contracts. If Biden even wants to cut defense spending it means even MORE money for them, because they cost less than tanks and  bases and shit
Also be prepared to hate me.

My 2500 shares have a 9.35 strike.
Yahoo finance? 
LOL my two positions also.  SBE and PLTR, all shares.
None lol but all your comments are bashing apple but there was one point you said Apple to the moon something changed somewhere lol
Lol thanks man. Fuck I really need APHA to moon
I kid you not, I wrote it off a few days ago thinking it was a weed stock. Stupid ticker imo
Not really considering my average was like 14 something.. yeah..
Thank you! Ill have to look into them as well
https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/apple-security-chief-accused-of-offering-bribe-of-ipads-for-gun-permits/
CMPS

Im sure there others as well.
APHA
Then something somewhat longer term (e.g for January). Otherwise Im sure someone else who has some can give an opinion.
That's where I'm at
Yeah will prob regret that decision when its at 30 EOW
Haha. Saaaaame. Today was such a bummer day for BABA call holders. Hopefully tomorrow starts the 
BAN
You havent already?
Hell yeah man those are some solid gains. Can you post graphs of progress?
How much you holding of THCB?
Nice good shit man! Idk if I'm gonna put in extra money (not working just studying rn) but I'll hold it in since it's very promising so far.
I get it. But what happens when the market turns on it.
Will do my man. Will do. Ill get to work on this tonight.
Doesn't matter anything can happens holiday is gonna be nice pump too
Dude it was a god-damned harsh lesson.

I made so much on fucking puts from February to April 3rd, I thought I was gonna be buying a new house in weeks.

What kills me, is when I had made like, multiple TLT 20 baggers, I actually at one point was like "Hey I liked NIO before, why not grab 1k shares" when they were like 2 bucks. I sat on them for a week and shit was boring so I FOMO'd it till it was all gone.

Such is life..
If Ant gets approval itll go to ATH
where im from they all suck ass, wish i were in the US
Damn those 1/15 itm calls look juicy. More upside and only a few dollars of time premium. The atm calls are absurdly expensive but itm have great prices. I'll probably sell my CRSR stock and buy an itm call instead.
Lol its a canadian company and they already have sales
Unfuck!
January 7.5s and March 6s
Who said it was your fault, retard?
After seeing how Luckin Coffee screwed everyone over, I dont invest in Chinese companies.
yearly max contribution of 6k
What did you sell today so I can buy tomorrow morning.
Also, if youre holding any BABA calls, can you sell those please?
You still got in early and will score bigly.
I mean, in broad strokes I guess sure, but one is Im not confident buying at these prices, the other is Im confident this stock was undervalued by 2000% a month ago and will keep running to this specific nice round number I pulled from my ass.
Which weeklies have been the most profitable for you before? And why did you decide to pick them up? If you don't mind me asking.
Girl***
Maybe after 7:1 stock split
What do you think it's going to be by Feb and what do you hope it'll be by Feb?
Thanks for the info
oh nice I have to get in earlier.
Ballsy moves but glad it worked out for you!
Can ya tell a brother ur strike?
Oh I agree, they offer all of that and then some. I think I'll stick with my union bros. Thanks for your feedback
Thanks bro
Thanks man
Thanks lol not gonna lie it's pretty wild, I didn't except it to blow up this fast
Might dump my portfolio into Roblox next week, it's been a fking crazy year!!!!!
What do you mean may be working
It went up 100% between March lows and June highs and outperformed everything then too. Not saying itll repeat but this price action reminds me of that. Some names are overvalued, some still have a ways to go still
They can say we dont do EV and algos will pick up on it and it will moon
Apha cron and cgc
WTF?
Whatever any of that means... I hope it makes me monies
I hope so. I tried buying it after hours on robinhood so idk if it went through or not
Got 350 stocks at $11.30.
When will it break out?should I buy some tomorrow?

True today I wouldve but nothing settled
So..yes? No? What do you recommend?
Yeah me too. I like their concept a lot
good for you
Fair
Strike and exp date?
right but they have announced, which makes a lot more appealing long term
oh wait I have JPM 135C not 130 i bought at 0.65 c u think im still good
250% you're in good shape too
$528 after hour should look good going into tomorrow!
COME ON BABY DO IT
probably 1.5k total loss on trade. Not too bad

You know what you are right.

For some reason I thought these guys would be reliable yet I saw every single broker fail to pass orders the last last month.

I guess thats a good lesson to be learned the hard way. At lest I wasnt locked out with profits melting away.
MSFT $200C 3/20 was like the only play for a while. And this was back when everybody on WSB would buy the same strikes and make the stock price rocket up due to MMs having to hedge with shares.
you read your TA however you want, the fact it was an orderly sell off = bullish
Also futes opened up before the biden news
I understand the general theory behind this. However, the world is in a credit crisis right now. Personal loan and auto loan defaults at its highest since 2008. I am just saying, there  will come a time in near future where people will cut back luxury purchases.  EV and cars are luxury items that people will cut back spending on.
Yea I just wanted something quick and easy for the week so I bought 200 shares and sold two calls at the strike just above. Today was so green and I waited to buy when the RSI was way oversold. I'm honestly hoping it will be assigned but if not I don't mind taking my $100 premium for the week and selling the shares at hopefully no worse than break even
Bruh I gained $600 then lost it while it kept going up
Ive noticed that its iv goes up in the morning then fades at 11
20 bagger or none
Fuck yeah bud. I'm holding 163 at the moment, bought at $1.38, I think tomorrow will be a good day.
So i should sell my calls is what Im hearing lol
Its been all downhill not even the pumps can save this boy
As we speak, ACB's already been up +11.42% AH lol. Keep an eye on them, it's gonna be wild tomorrow!

Edit: 16.02% now HOLY SHIT
Damn! You got in at high 2s? Smart man. Did you recoup initial capital with every one of your investments, or just this particular one?
I Forget God has divine plan
Damn. Thanks for the summary bro!
I know and will win if dared to take risk
I'm gonna buy 500 worth of stocks tomorrow and see what happens for a week or.two
Ffff
I'm betting $1000 you are a virgin
Very true
How is it whining to want to see a shitty stock fail?
Eh, I hear what you're saying.

I just think that AH/futures pump would've had more zest to it if we were legit looking at some massive green rally tomorrow.
I have no bearish positions right now. 

And calling my post "desperate" is absolute nonsense. The fuck is desperate about asking why people are expecting a rally tomorrow? On a stock sub? 

If anything, this attempt to paint me as a desperate bear is the most  desperate shit in this whole thread. 

Have a drink. Suck a dick. Go to bed.
The Admin has to propose something. Probably March or April. At which point if the senate is still under McConnell, Id sell. If Georgia flips the senate, all in stocks options everything EV
Thats more like it
Yeah they just replied my ticket and that was the reason.
Anyone know if there is a way to make them wave this restriction?
I could see that happening for sure but I would say a large portion will dump
Definitely not my favorite subject, but it beats my other classes. Honestly just ready to be done with school at this point
I mean, my portfolio bussin so no complaints. Ill just take the L and buy them back tmro, no biggie.
I did pass out before in my college class some time ago but I dont think that counts smh lol
Im above $250 and Im only on one stock. Feels good.
I sold half my calls that are closer to expiry and the other half that are a bit further out I am holding for a few months. Expect it to keep going a bit...other EV companies have popped significantly and nkla has to play catch up IMO. Once the market shrugs off the negative headlines completely/ GM owns the partnership. Who knows...
Better yet Ill show you [this thread](https://twitter.com/itradepasts/status/1327380722152337408?s=21) which called out every move the past 2 weeks
Puts?
No, you literally buy it at the extended hours price. Ah hours is closed now. It ended at 8pm est. Pre market for most retail investors is available at  5am est. Sometimes if I wake up early I'll scalp shares laying in bed if somthing is moving a lot in pre market
I like to live vicariously. Once the wife gets out of school and we have two incomes I can start playing again but it's not worth the risk atm.
Thx.  I heard dec 31. But who knows.
Could be a couple weeks.  I'm thinking of this as getting into ciic at 11
Within/around 2 weeks so Ive heard baby doggie
They had a pretty good run for a while. They started declining when the East India Company did, but that could have been a chicken and egg thing. Forget how that ended though. Too many alternate history simulators clogging up my memory cells. Probably war with the British.
cool thx, will prob pick some up right now AH
damn cant find them on IBKR :(
Jesus Dude, good luck, Im happy to sacrifice my puts for that cause.

Hell yeah. Im playing it both ways. Im holding puts right now so Im a little biased
Yup, no problem
Fair enough I was the opposite this morning...I saw it open up 3 and I said fuck it and pulled the trigger on shares and calls. Short term one of the better impulse plays Ive made lately.
i don't think it's that. I think now it's the vaccines putting a clear end to it, plus the fact that the market has completely divorced itself from the economic pain of the 50% of people who own no stocks.

which surely can't go tits up!
Yacht season
PLTR NIO and VTR (VTR I sell covered calls on and have been making bank for 6 months on it).

Then a bunch of other stuff, Redfin got in at $29, then about 8 other random shit.

The bulk of the moves this week will be due to NIO and PLTR (Been in my NIO positions since $26).

I would say most of my positions are stock or ITM leaps so I don't have to sweat the day to day move but that said when the moves rocket like they did today, well even leaps respond well.

My favorite long term play is the 20 PLTR $10c 1/23 got into them for $12 per when the stock was $18, so $8 of the cost was intrinsic at that point.

I also bought 50 $25s and 50 $30s on PLTR as a joke due to that meme on Thursday, and they are at a profit right now but I hope the stock rockets more on Tuesday and Wed and I sneak in a nice killing on these.
good, ev to the moon
DKNG, 2 44c 12/4- 2 49c 12/4 and AAPL 113c12/4 and MSFT 207.5c 12/4 all bought in the morning dip, well i hope they were dips good luck to you as well. what ya playing?
Nice one still.

I think Arrival will go up tho.
You are out of your goddamn mind. Wall Street likes being in control and theyre happy they own Biden. But Biden is not good for the economy.

Or rather his plans from his puppets. People dont actually think hes making decisions
Eh eh
Doubt it.  Its Trump.  Dude doesn't give up.  If he loses in court, he'll probabaly vacate, but claim foul play the whole way out.

Id be a little concerned about some of the constitutional cases hes presenting, especially the one in PA about mail in ballots.  If he wins through the courts, there's gonna be hell.
April 1st, 2026 I believe. It's the deadline to exercise them if they're not called first.
Yeah usually 20/30 days. As long as they watch their portfolio weekly and check notifications they should be able to exercise them in time no worries. If you get caught lacking on the other hand that sucks!
God bless Steve Weiss
Bro...debt is the new asset. Thats why we printing.
Look man il not trying to sound like a stud (ive only had 2 gfs and wish it were more).

But ive fked girls like that very casually. LA girls in general are very attractive, but theyre so high maintenance i wouldnt recommend living here. I still cant get a gf to this day even tho my number has gone up in the last 2 years
Half the expense ratio and cheaper share price is nice.  Same return.  GLD is better for short term trading though as volume is higher.
I see
Hype just started today, if you look youll see it all over the thread now. There was a DD post today by the guy who called CIIC
I use trading 212 and options scare me
Good work! See you in Vahalla 
Sold it brother just like BABA this morning when DonnyPump cucked me
https://imgur.com/a/rKI9Gkd - 5K from today not showing up in the graph yet. At one point earlier in the day I was up 13K. They aren't all guaranteed wins but I've been winning more than losing.
Im not holding any. I got all my money in calls right now. Although I am thinking of putting 50% of my port into it tomorrow 
https://i.imgur.com/OQB5Yeu.jpg
Yeah, it can be a harsh lesson.  I had a january NIO 17c I picked up in September for 350, and flipped it 2 days later for 100%.  Im kicking myself in the ass for that one.

Good luck to ya brother
Totally. Heard in a stock analysis video that the ipo is most likely just delayed
Good luck my guy! Either way youre buying CRSR so you win
I really like the company theyre merging with tho (based in Texas)
I get what you mean, I'm just pulling your leg
i haven't done too many weeklies, but i had a solo one did all right and my pltr ones are doing well. it's pretty much just a guess where you think it'll go haha
I think 300 by end of dec is reasonable. It was way oversold on the china policies. Lookup a TA video on baba

Dec 18 69c just realized I wrote it wrong
No problem man. Unions are a great thing to be into. Utilize what you can from them and get yourself that great paying position down the line where you dont have to worry about questions like you just asked because youll be making too much money to care. Thats my goal too.
bro ur lit, roll it out into the next stonk lol. THCB is what that one dude who told us about CIIC to get next, and its already mooning
also, did you have warrants or somn? how you get that much? rh sucks cuz i cant get warrants lol
Yeah this is eerily similar to June sell off with banks and energy ripping. Too much enthusiasm with a raging pandemic on our hands.
Or they could just talk about estimated value of homes and just use EV for short.
gotta select fill after hrs on rh, dude not that hard, After hours is very important and thats why other brokers arre better cuz rh cuts off after hrs at 6
Hard to time things perfectly. Id read through some DD and compare the 1 week and 1 month charts to all the other EV tickers that have already blown up and use that to help time your entry
FUBO 35c Mar'21. All in, my dude.
i mean...before they announced you wouldnt have bought? cuz what im hearing is you want to wait for big pplayers to come in and bid up the price enough so that you have confidence in it? go do some individual dd, this is how real players play the game
Yah man it's looking Juicy!! shit should print for sure. Futures looking good as well. You have a target in mind? Holding my spread until Friday when I reach most profit. Never hold this bitches to expiration. Seen too many nightmare stories.
Exactly it could be worse. Learn a lesson and improve, next time you guys will both get 10 baggers :) . 
I was here and I may have bought it....just don't remember it.
yeah ok but AH was flat af until the biden news dropped at 6:05
Janet Yellen just got appointed as future treasury secretary and the us controls one of the most powerful money printers in the world and the military budget to back it up. Interest rates are low, people are buying houses. And if your government is incentivizing you to buy an EV and you need a car to get work like China then its a good deal.
Hopefully it will work out for you better than it did for me! I agree assignment would be a fine exit
Exactly
good shit lol, imagine you put in 100k at 1.38.. jesus
yeah, i mean that's true until it isn't
Pass some of that to apha please.   Get that money man
Oooo damn just rocketed up to 5.2% we getting paid 
Totally depends! And I honestly just followed a Reddit tip. I sank 4K in at high 2s on speculation and did research as it popped. Now Im riding the wave.

Ive never had a 2 week period when I made 200% returns so Im kind of making it up as I go.
Stop being a bear, youll get wrecked.
Just be careful not to get in if it becomes overheated.

Look at the Tesla chart. It went up too quickly, then into a wedge to find market value, and is going up too quickly again; destined to repeat the wedge.
You can do a cash account with another broker but I thinks its SEC rules and cannot be waved by RH.
Yeah I was definitely at that point. Near graduation, had my fun and then some, and was ready to get out of school and never go back. 95% of everything after is boring and shitty though lol. Live it up work a few years and consider going back for masters/law school. More fun and thats where the real money is.
nice, which?
What brokerage do you use?
Bro at least buy 1 single ev short dated OTM call and that will turn into tendies overnight
People here are constantly memeing and shitposting but for real thank you for being a responsible adult. The amount of stress your wife and you would deal with if you started betting on stock is not worth it. Good luck on getting in better shape financially at some point, mate.
Much appreciated bud!
Totally understandable, I think closer to 55 is when the actual wall might kick in. If there was a day where it would have slowed down I feel like it wouldve been the start of a new week instead we went even higher
fuck yea bro. Let's roll
Ah ok. So were in the same boat. Well both be looking at 15-20 grand more if palantir continues its ascent
BABA, RIOT and SE, I also have stock in MSFT and AAPL  I am really bullish on DKNG in the future too :)
I sold my riot calls in the morning but I could of waited a bit more but its ok im working on being consistent with taking profits
absolutely, love the company. I don't want to FOMO back in, so I plan on selling puts and hopefully getting assigned once options become available which should be soon
Yeah, exactly. Lmao. Thanks for making my point for me.
I hope for sake of my calls that he doesnt go any further than 6000miles out the door of the White House.
Ohhhhhh It's just written like a call with a 26 strike. Weird. 

Thank you so much!
for real!!!!  The Judge set him up so PERFECT today too... i was pumped at that pump.
Better off getting into debt stimming the economy tho not on killing oil industry petrol cars etc.
Maybe I should stay here where Im pretty average, Id probably be ugly af in LA lol
Cool. Will add it to my list. Didn't know it existed.
That post is not in first 2 pages.
Thcb is shares only. Get after it!
For some reason the link isnt working. Very solid returns tho, I will have to dabble a little bit in that strategy as well
Gotcha
Honestly I don't think it's smart to sell CIIC for that stock. CIIC mooned so hard because it's an amazing company, 10x better than any SPAC except DraftKings this year. No guarantee that THCB moons even close to CIIC levels.
All shares, was too much of a pussy to buy warrants last week. Would be up more if I bought warrants but I'm not mad.
Which broker should I use
Gotcha, might buy at market open tomorrow
I think Im out with any profits $500+ or if its momentum Ill let it sit through 11AM max, since its a weekly. Your spreads should be Gucci! Just cash out and roll over into dec 24 whenever youre happy
I did buy it.......at the top. 

And it was the reason I didn't have cash to buy puts for the March drop.
yes.. cause a 0.07% move ah is flat...
Why does this happen if their is no news like ER ?
I already got in a bit a ago. NIO LI PLTR MP. Selling TSLA that expire 11/27 and putting that money right to work on the EVs till Xmas

Tesla is headed to 1500 before the punch bowl gets taken away in April by McConnell
I had just about enough of the college lifestyle by my sophomore year lol. I thought a lot about law school. My brother is a lawyer and said that I would enjoy it, but I wanted to do something in comp sci so Im getting a applied mathematics degree, and now that Im looking into jobs Ive almost completely lost interest in that as well
I could probably throw a couple hundred at it but fair warning this will cause the sector to crash. I have that innate ability.
Trump admin on verge to concede i read? BABA gonna print and RIOT good, youre set bro
Out of touch Wall Street boomers are not good for the economy. But they think they are.
Lol.  Time will tell I guess.  I just wish the media wasn't so quick to turn a blind eye to what hes doing in court.  Its dangerous to be so decided before real results are out, no matter how small a chance.  It reminds me of the bush/gore 2000 election.
Exactly. 11.5 strike 4/1/2026 expiration. The warrants now are trading at a premium of 1.59. Once THCB is above 11.50 the warrants are basically in the money and start growing quick!
I own MRNA shares/calls, so i appreciated that pump as well
Bro im fking ugly but ive madeout a ton, smashed a few.

Im 5'8 too.

Just workiut and be normal. Bar set high for girls but low for guys. So many guys are trash im serious
Same company as GLD.  Its just their cheaper option for institutions etc.
It was earlier lmao do u know how Reddit works
Already done bro put whatever I had left into it earlier today lmao
https://imgur.com/a/HpKRzeY
Yeah, I keep getting errors on IMGUR at the moment. DM me tomorrow if you're interested and I'll try again. It wasn't until I put this strategy in play that I started doing well. I was constantly trying to pick meme stocks, get in at the right time, hold over night and get out at the right time and was simply horrible at it. I noticed though while doing so that early on in the trade I was often up 5-10% within minutes, sometimes even more because of the current market volatility. so I decided to just go after quick short gains and it has been working like a charm. I'm sure this will end once volatility drops but for now I'm running with it.
I dont know man, i like it because its near its floor. these can all get fucked in an instant any day, and CIIC has a lot more to fall than THCB, plus if u look at blnk, there is so much run up potential for other ev battery players, and THCB/microvast is already an established business in china, they will win
yea im not either lol, i mean u were ballsy to hold thru the mini dip last week and you were greatly rewarded, Congrats again brother and lets get the FUCKIN next!
i mean, I use both because i like robinhoods margin, I can invest 2x my money, but webull is superior in every other sense lol
Thats probably the move unless it runs too hard in premarket! Well see 
...yes
Mainly because the stock pumps in the premarket and right after open, then stays at about the same amount for the rest of the day +/- a few dollars
Sounds about right. Honestly find a half way decent job for two years. Travel, have fun, live the dream, explore some new hobbies and if math/comp science is right itll work out. If not go back to school. Just dont get complacent in a shitty job.
The economy hasnt mattered since 2008 man, what are you even talking about lmao
Yh exactly at the moment you think hes gone or its over, hes there, waiting with his sausage fingers in the air screaming for attention with instant noodles for a yee yee ass haircut.
Oh, no options. Bummer.
Dude, it has to stay in the first 10 posts, otherwise its useless
Very nice, been a pretty good week for you! Thanks for sharing
Yeah it seems like youve found a very effective strategy. One of the things Im actually trying to improve on is just pulling the trigger to get out of a position when I hit profit (often like you said, in the first few minutes when you can easily be up 5-10-20%). Ive lost so many gains by being greedy and not taking profits like that.
No i agree, it's definitely a good play for a pop if you get in early and you could probably 2x your money, but I just wouldn't expect it to push high 20s within 1 week like CIIC. Arrival is a special company.
Thanks bro let's get this fkin money
Hmm ok ty
Honestly I needed to here that, cheers man.
Not good for the stock market either
Lol, don't let him get to your head, man.  Maybe take a few days off of political news.  I think if we all did that, we'd find a lot more commonalities with everyone either side of the aisle.

Good luck to your calls tomorrow, man
Oops didn't know that since not an FD guy but makes sense.  IAU looks like it has options and is a bit cheaper than GLD.
Ok I really do not care, miss out on the gains
I dont know man, it seems like all ev related stonks are popping at least 22% a day. Look at FTEK and DPW
Im not triggered. Just dissatisfied. 
I don't trade FDs. Was going to buy leaps. I mainly scalp gold futures though but way too scared to hold futures contracts.
Well I'll save that stuff for others, I wouldn't put my money there
Hey man, most Americans are.  Not many people are ideologues.  So you're in the company of many others, even if they're dissatisfied for other reasons lol.

I gotta say, that is one great thing about being an American.  Its always nice to criticize the government lol
Ah gotcha.  Good luck.
you just had a big win, you should chill out lol
ya
pray for my big win. i regret not shooting fully on CIIC lol. had 50k in it and made 10 over night and was satisfied, but i shouldnt have been lol FUCK
No, you have to ask your broker to redeem them during a certain window.
Thats what the warrants do?
my portfolio is highly diversified in only the finest meme stocks anyways
o sorry I must have replied to the wrong comment. After the merger warrants usually are worth ~share price -$11.50.
Hear hear!
Oh okay so if it doesnt work out theyre worthless but if its a success you get share price for them? Sounds juicy.
They're worth share price minus redemption cost (11.50 usually). There's also some theta at work so it's not an exact match.
When do they expire?
