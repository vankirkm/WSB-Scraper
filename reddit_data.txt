When you see gains for 5 straight days a red day feels like a personal attack
Same ones that say "I'll hold these shares forever" and "It'll be worth $xx.xx in 5 years" are the same ones that panic sell on a down day after owning shares for a month
"what's the next meme stock?"   he asks hopefully,  as he rips up notes on technical analysis.
All I want for Christmas is $40 PLTR
Buy Palantir
I wonder if anybody will comment about PLTR?
My portfolio is loaded with boomer / safe haven stocks - NIO, PLTR, XPEV, the usual suspects. These stocks only move 10-20% per day, so Id like to introduce a bit of risk into my portfolio. 

I was told that this would be a good place to ask. 

Are there any tickers that double every day? Im generally pretty risk averse, so Im looking to ease into this.

WSB: Why hast thou forsaken me, Lord?!
My Robinhood card just got declined at Burger King. I have no tendies now I have no tendies.
Its amazing how a $.50 drop on one stock will wipe a lot of people out today.
To anyone panicking about PLTR, you do realize it dropped about this much just during lunch yesterday.... right?
Palantir at levels we havent seen since.....45 min before close yesterday 
PSA

Markets will be closed tomorrow on Thanksgiving. Re-opens on Friday, but will close early at 1PM EST.

Expect unexpected price action.

And also, buy the dip if there is one. There probably will be profit taking. Be patient, or don't be. YOLO.

Today might be wild. 
Its like they pull the lever and get 3 bars every time -Jim Cramer 
Palantir is retarded strong
PLTR already knows how today ends so get in
U guys want a hint? Any girl with a clavicle tattoo or rib tattoo is 100% willing to put out. Its like a modified tramp stamp.
Gonna tell my kids they aint getting Turkey tomorrow

"WTF bro? you guys said to buy PLTR for 2 weeks so I finally bought in and it's not going up in a straight line anymore.  what a POS stock!"
If youre having a bad day just know that Im gonna be down a min 20k at open in TSLA, NIO and Xpev calls
Cnbc terrified of average people making money off the system
PLTR gang  you fucking retards
What the hell is an EV stock and why are my NIO shares tanking
I wish reddit would stop forcing all this gain porn on me, all it does is make me want to finally jump off a building for missing another opportunity out of hell
up 13k yesterday, down 5k today so far 
I bought xpev pre market yesterday so my avg price of 76 is higher than the listed 52 week high of 74.49 
LMAO WE ARE JUST STAYING CONSERVATIVE UNTIL WE HEAR JOBLESS CLAIMS IN 1.5 HRS

THEN BULL RALLY CONTINUES

DONT TELL THE BEARS, LET THEM LEARN THE HARD WAY
Lol pltr gonna floor at open and then crank all day... same as everyday

#LOADING 92 PREMIUM GAS FOR PLTR PLUTO MISSION
Imagine owning Palantir stock but you dont drive a Palantir
PLTR just bought my girlfriends engagement ring. Her dumbass is about to marry an autistic retard
Honestly; Chinas future is EV.

I see no way NIO is worth less than $300 in 5 years. I feel this is very realistic and conservative seeing the fuckery of TSLA. 

Take any tendies you made and throw some in NIO shares. Thank me in 5 years 
PLTR literally just payed off my house after taxes.
Remember to shill PLTR to family and friends tommorow, gotta pump this thing up even more.
NIOs last correction was worse than this and it set new ATHs is all Im sayin
Corsair is clearly in an upwards channel. Buy the dip.

Palantir did this 3 times this week. Buy the dip.

For Tesla i'm not sure.
PLTR heading back to 26 and beyond
Was bout to chill today and enjoy a little early release into the holiday weekend, fuckin found out right before leaving work yesterday the boss signed me up for the company Turkey Bowl. Now I'm sitting this morning here drinking my coffee listening to the wind howl outside and watching the weather radar fill up with green and yellow/orange. Fml so anyway PLTR calls obv
I will never financially recover from this
All aboard PLTR, next stop tendie town 
NIO why would you touch me like that while I was asleep
PLTR futures are green: Fuck yea.

PLTR futures are red: Futures don't mean shit.
PLTR back to levels 30 minutes before close yesterday and people taking about having diamond hands and not selling. Wow. So strong of you.
Im thinking buy the PLTR dip. I went cash gang overnight.
Ahh yes, bears celebrating with more than an hour before open, Ive seen this movie before.
Thicc b gang still out there?
#PLTR CHADS STAND THE FUCK UP
Betting against PLTR is literally betting against the CIA. Im good on that. Pay me, feds.
Fuck NIO, PLTR is my homie now
When they said pltr to 30 by eow I did not realize that meant end of Wednesday.
PLTR dropping like a stone to... exactly where it was 15 minutes before close yesterday.
[Here's us](http://imgur.com/a/NYA1GJH) congratulating each other on our TSLA, NIO, LI, XPEV, BLNK, and SBE calls. Id like to name CRSR and PLTR as honorary EV stocks on such a bigly week. 


TSLA has a larger market cap than WMT by 100b. WMT owns 200b in real estate and has 550b in revenue vs 28b for TSLA.
Remember half an hour ago when PLTR was down ten cents from yesterday's close and this thread went bearish as fuck? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
This day looks red to me... whats that?... BAH GOD ITS PALANTIR WITH THE STEEL CHAIR
#IF EVERYONE JUST BUYS AND NEVER SELL WE CAN KEEP GOING UP
PLTR. If this shit crashes im selling my kids and buying the fucking dip
Oh no PLTR down to levels not seen since yesterday at lunch
PLTR down 3% ore market and ppl howling. Like bruh it was $11 before the election
Meme stocks getting slaughtered today
Funny thing is PLTR is still trading at the same level it was at before that hulk green pump right before close.  People are going to load the fuck up on calls at open.
PLTR came back like the mf mcrib
12 minutes until I drop 10K on PLTR
#Morgan Stanley you s downgraded PLTR last week, look at you s and your  call, just close your company and join WSB you filthy fucks!

LMAO PLTR IS COMING BACK UP I LOVE IT SO MUCH
So the PLTR dip is over before the markets even open.
PLTR needs to stay the fuck down I want to buy more calls
Say hello to PLTR 25 today.
Don't fuck with PLTR.

US Gov is backing it.
PLTR is like nah, I don't do red over here, I am the government bitch
Lmfao I LOVE when I see every comment getting a downvote instantly. Someone here got bad advice and is upset 
PLTR dropped 3 cents and I averaged down
PLTR I would tell you how much I love you but you already know everything about me Im sure...
Im upvoting all your stuff that the moonwalking bear downvoted. Dont worry I got you .. lets go PLTR
Uh. Hello? Department of Game and Inland Fisheries?


Id like to report a mass extinction of gay bears. Yes. All of them just dropped dead.
I might as well be a Palantir employee how they paying me rn
PLTR bottom was 4 minutes ago
PLTR doesnt know what red days are
so..you fucked up and didn't buy the PLTR dip for the 50th time today
You know whos truly fucked? All these salty bears that are downvoting PLTR comments. Do you know what they do at PLTR? WE WILL FIND YOU
Jesus Christ after reading this sub panicking I check to see PLTR is down less than 3% premarket after gaining 13% yesterday. 

This is what happens when you have a week of straight greens. Stop being gigantic pussies.
Why is THC-B banned here? So fucking stupid.
Any wrinkle brains buying PLTR?
Sir, this is a comedy forum attached to a money flushing receptacle.
Stfu if youre bitching about PLTR. $23 wouldve seemed like a dream two days ago. Nothing moves straight up all the time.
Do I drop 10k on PLTR?
Everyone who thinks pltr is a pump and dump doesnt actually know what they doooooooo. 
damn pltr really cant be stopped all aboard
Let's have a moment of silence for NIO

PLTR bulls just went to the back to grab some metal chairs.
Jesus fuck PLTR I love you
Imagine not diversifying you entire portfolio into PLTR
Why is anyone playing anything other than PLTR? 

Do you hate money?
Shout out to those of you who have made $500 today laying naked in your bed 
PLTR $28 TODAY?! JEEEZUS
PLTR went from being 5% of my portfolio to 50% with these gains. Its insane.
the strength of 10 thousand retards
I am ok with PLTR being the next TSLA meme millionaire maker. People who complain should just scroll by.
MFW I want to buy the PLTR dip but it won't dip.
FYI, youre not buying the top at PLTR

This baby is in the breakout zone and will continue to run

Book it, nerds
Only having like $100 to my name and seeing the gains on PLTR definitely hurts. Congratulations to everybody.
PLTR doubled my money so far
Its just a little EV correction, NIO will be 60 next week
Market: *dips*

Bears: **OMG WE DONT HAVE TO SUCK DICK FOR MONEY TODAY?! JUST FOR FUN?!**

markets: *goes back to where it was*

bears just can never win.
Lol this CRSR premarket panic is funny. Time to load up again for next week like usual.
 Friendly reminder to my fellow non-Americans, the markets are closed for Thanksgiving tomorrow, and will close early at 1 pm the day after, Black Friday 
Yall over there crying about PLTR being down 1% meanwhile I got Xpev and NIO calls down 10%
Hey , Can you do something for me?

Save this for when PLTR hits 30 
Im sorry. Cramer is actually retarded. On Monday or Friday he was telling everyone to buy the entire market on Tuesday! 

Tuesday comes around, market gets bought where are the sellers?! This is crazy!!
So yolo play PLTR ?
TSLA, nooo a reasonable pullback after a massive run does not fall in line with my $600 calls expiring on Friday!
Might buy up more PLTR. My NIO gamble is unsalvageable however
putting more into PLTR at open seems like   are selling at open free tendies for me
I dont think this PLTR dip is gonna last long.
My family is going to be proud of me when I pull up for Thanksgiving in my new PLTR EV

palantir is unreal.....and I love it
Who doubted PLTR
I'm +250% on my $PLTR 30c 1/15 and holding
Its ok NIO, you go when you feel like it
Load up on more CRSR?
Is this a good time to buy CRSR dip?
How the hell is PLTR still ripping, with barely any pullbacks?

And somewhere, some sick fuck has been holding since the IPO and still holding.  I don't have nearly enough balls.
God I love this fucking market.  Just find the most overhyped and overvalued stock, buy as much of it as possible, profit.
The only regret I have with PLTR is not buying more
PLTR.  
You need to fucking chill.  


I love it, but jesus fucking christ this is scary growth.
PLTR mooning...

r/Investing and r/PersonalFinance in shambles. LMAO
RIP Maradona. This one really took me back. We've lost some absolute legends this year. While it sucks a lot of times, life is precious. I appreciate this sub and yall.
bought 100 shares of PLTR just to be part of the fun. I'm riding economy class, but glad to be on the rocket.
#PRINTER GO PLTRRRRRRRRRRRRRR 
I bought PLTR at 10, sold at 9.11. But... 

>!I rebought PLTR at 13. Sold at 26!<
Hold PLTR calls.  It'll reach 30 EOW.
PLTR going to make me cry... it's my first big play after snooping around here for like 2 years and i finally got the balls thank you!!!

edit: next week it'll be gone probably
LMAO PLTR has an RSI of 85. Shit is retarded yo
EVERYBODY IN PLTR IS A GOAT
I feel like PLTR will be what TSLA has become. I can honestly see us 3 years from now with PLTR at $100...after a 10/1 stock split.
holy shit I'm actually going to have to consider my tax situation now thanks to PLTR
I'm not selling PLTR until I see memes about it on tiktok
With PLTR shares we still hold right? I mean I didn't expect these gains so soon. The potential immediate profit is fucking with my brain.... Anyways.... I'll hold until I die
You literally put money in PLTR

and it gives you more money back

Is that not free money?
bought PLTR with 20k on my 4th day trade, sold at 30k  and now im a pattern day trader
PLTR bears new tactic is to beg us to take profits hahahahahaha
I hate myself for having such a small PLTR position but just imagine not having one.
Be fearful when others are fearful

Just found out I got into the Masters program I wanted, so even if theres a pullback, Ill just buy the dip while having one less thing to worry about 
Everything fucking sucks today. Gonna lose over 20k at open. GF might have Covid so cant visit family for thanksgiving. Puts on me boys, puts on fucking me
If PLTR hits 30, I'm.......


...not doing anything, I'll stay at home and avoid the risk of an ongoing global pandemic
RIP to the meme team

Lets not kid ourselves.
We know meme dips are getting bought today.

Sold all my Tesla options yesterday to go cash just to go back in on calls before market close 
9 minutes to an epic data dump

Whered all the PLTR bears go? Say goodbye to your money short sellers.
Why the fuck do we have a pre-market?

PLTR calls at open?? Is anyone crazy enough to actually buy puts for this one lol
PLTR = Penis Length Tripling RN
Stop waiting for the PLTR 'dip' this is it's 3rd 10%+ day in a row. Just buy in and wait for your gains
Buy CRSR dip or regret
WSB was basically spoon fed PLTR for days if not weeks. How are some of you idiots losing money in this market when weve been basically holding your hand through this?  People who got caught bag holding EV and CRSR can still easily redeem themselves on PLTR but man some of you staring at your old NIO/CRSR positions today need to get your head checked.
PLTR's tight-sideways winding normally leads to a break out to new highs. Let's see if that still holds today.
Once PLTR's smart money phase (WSB + stocktwits accumulation) completes it'll be sitting at $115. That's when the real hype begins.

I realistically see PLTR reaching $46,550 per share by 2035.
PLTR really planted the seed of this  themselves so they can study us for replication
Im fully retarded and bought a PLTR $28c for Friday. Dont be me.
Emperor Biden needs to declare that all PLTR gains are tax-free. Write your representatives today.
People who sold their Tesla calls this morning because it started tanking  

Its me. Im people
PLTR is up 10%.

And we still have 5 hours of trading left.
I don't know why, but I just felt the urge to FOMO into PLTR
Another day of missing PLTR, fml
PLTR TO 30 EOW
Just ate that 27$ like it was nothing
GET YOUR TITS OUT FOR PLTR
WSB just increased PLTR price target from 4 rocket emojis to 
LOOOOOOOOOOOOLL PLTR 30 EOD
The people who posted to buy into PLTR and MGNI calls, I love you. Blindingly going into calls seems like the right thing to do here
PLTR cant possibly keep looking.  Looks at PLTR 
Why work a day job anymore
HOURLY REMINDER TO BUY MORE PLTR
Imagine if the poors bought PLTR at $10 instead of scratchers
I like how we are at 92 on the greed and fear scale. Does that even mean anything anymore? Im just buying up calls and shares left and right. Fuck that boomer scale.
Bought PLTR at the top.

RIP everybody else's calls, fuck all of you, you're going to burn with me.
NOT TOO LATE TO GET INTO PLTR
Told my dad to buy PLTR last week and now he thinks Im actually good at this retarded shit
Imagine getting out of PLTR at 12$ with 11% of profit 
PLTR legit might squeeze to 40 by end of nxt wk
I buy expirations 45-60 days out with zero intention of holding more than 2-3 days.
Ok dude pltr is no meme. This thing is real
PLTR is the fucking meme that wont die. Jesus Christ. Next time I see the retards on here chirping about something for a week Im just gonna yolo $50k into the stock and wait a week.
Holy mother of fuck Palantir

Im so glad I went 100% all in around 16. Best week of my life
Lol remember how outrageous PLTR 30 EOW sounded on monday
Pltr was down pre market today LOLOLOLOL
I yolo'd 90% of my account in PLTR **shares** over the last few days. 

Now I can get bullied by r/investing and r/wallstreetbets simultaneously. 
Someone got absolutely fucked today judging by these downvotes
Im literally jerking off in front of my PLTR screen, no cap
GO PLTR GO
I sold my PLTR calls this morning - F
God damn. I was torn with PLTR, watching it since $13. Said fuck it and went all in today at $25 or so, my portfolio is up 60% with all my calls. Thank you guys. Thank you

Jim Cramer truly is an awful human. Two weeks ago: dont touch oil stocks they are un-investible. Last Monday are you seeing the movement in these EV names? Look at Nikola! Thats an impressive company! Literally do the fucking opposite do whatever this man does. He hates oil? Go leveraged long. Likes EVs? Dump that shit. He keeps retail out of the smart plays and only lets them have the garbage Wall Street looks to sell to people.

#MEME-MAGEDDON
CRSR consistently does 10% days. Theres a 2% pullback and retards here start losing their minds 
Now Tesla crashing. Im gonna be down 15k+ at open 
With the PLTR dip happening, I feel hungover from the euphoria of the past week. Like me and PLTR have been partying hardcore, snorting lines and raw dogging hookers.....we could keep this up forever, now were headed to the doc for std tests.
You know the drill. Green by open.

Edit: honestly though looking like a nice head and shoulders forming on the spy weekly. We fuk. Maybe.
I am in charge of how I feel and today I am choosing happiness. ... I am in charge of how I feel and today I am choosing happiness. ... I am in charge of how I feel and today I am choosing happiness. ... FUUUCK
Ok just to get it right, we are buying the dips and not selling, correct?
Fuckit bois, more PLTR calls
Repeat after me: I. Will. Not. Sell. 
CRSR and PLTR pumping. TSLA...wtf
Pltr calls at open?
Today will be a mix of fear, greed, panic selling and fomo buying at the same time. Half this sub getting wiped out either way and MM's banging your wives.  Steer cash into safe harbors for the holiday and go spend quality time with your families. 

Safe Harbor = TSLA and PLTR late dec calls and leaps or cash gang for AirBNB ipo nxt month. Fuk bers
PLTR dont care man

Pltr touching 25 today?
huh so NIO doesn't trace TSLA into ATH yesterday but decides to trace it today when its down? GOT IT

okay 100% in PLTR Calls and bought every dip...
Which one of you retards bought my PLTR 11/27 31c? Lol
PLTR nice entry before 25.5
don't be a pussy like me and sell your PLTR calls to soon for a reduced profit
PLTR do that trick again, where u make me cum
GME bleeding the shorts rn LFG
PLTR $27 EOD ride the wave
Since joining this sub I have tried several times to play TSLA and every time I have either gotten burned or broken even. It might seem stupid but the only reason why I want to play TSLA is because when I first got here it seemed like a stock that would always be out of reach with its almost $2k plus price and astronomical option premiums pre-split. 

Well, finally did it... I bought a 11/27 $560c at $500 and just sold at $1300. I know its not much, but it was a monkey I had to get off my back. 

Now back to the stupid gains from my PLTR 1/15 $17cs.

Broooooo! For the first time since June Im positive all time. 

Tsla scared me this morning, averaged down once and was already holding 2 12/24 550c. Averaging down worked, yeeted them calls on the pump and Im out now.

Furthest down was 30k, ended September down 20k.  Id like to thank theta gang, fewer options yolos, and listening to the few non retards here for the comeback. 

If youre down rn, just know if my dumb ass can come back, you can too.

Thank you WSB! I've changed my strategy from randomly picking losers to just going with WSB momentum play. Picked up a measly 400 shares of PLTR. Don't know what they do. Don't care. All I know is that I'm up 2K.. Going to sell at the close and keep only the shares that represent the 2K gain. I think this is my new way of doing business cause I suck ass without you degenerate fucks.

Who's holding PLTR over thanksgiving? 12/4 30c already up 60% from two hours ago when I bought it.
PLTR flashed 29!
I cant wait for Cramer to absolutely lose his shit about this.
THIS IS OUR FUCKING MARKET
I made more in 3 days from a company I know nothing about than I have in 9 months of trading, earning plays, DD, and research.
LETS PUMP PLTR BOIIIIISSSS LETS GOOOOOOOO 
Guys keep buying PLTR!!! Lets push this shit to 33 eod!
Seeing soros miss out on these tendies makes me happy
HOLD PLTR!!!! 35 EOW
# I'm upgrading PLTR eod PT to 38 from 30

gap up to 40 on friday
Raise your hand if you're a fucking moron like me and didn't buy PLTR calls yesterday
Member that time in the premarket that PLTR was -3% and people were saying we are going for a -20% correction?

Pepperidge farm remembers.
If you're new to PLTR: After lunch it pulls back some, then it rockets up to close, then AH it goes another 7% or so.

This is the trend over the last week so it's guaranteed to continue
Funny thing is PLTR is unironically not a meme stock
wsb is gonna get shut down by the sec if PLTR sees another 15% day  this shit is ridiculous  i feel like im on the other side of the insider trading finally.  my leaps r up 5 hunndo p rn
T H C B 

Pls moon

I cracked the ban code bois. Just space the letters
Chinese officials investigating the two EV companies that does not include NIO XPEV or LI and it dropped. This is like the other news where the US bans the stocks that was under military control. Buy the EV dip
I said earlier to pull out of chinese EV shares and regroup into PLTR.

I was wrong.

Pull out of fucking everything and regroup it all into PLTR.

Fuck to the moon, PLTR is going to Mars 
If robinhood traders supposedly affect the market so much, why does all the action happen when theyre asleep?
Theyre talking shit about us again on CNBC haha
Imagine selling PLTR at open
Imagine not fomoing PLTR
PLTR bears fell for the premarket trap again
I hate being a part of the PLTR movement where everyone comments  every day as if its a tough decision to hold a stock that goes up +5% every day
PLTR literally pulled me out from abject poverty to... where I was before I joined this sub
Listen, we need to get PLTR to $30 or people will not get their PS5s. Do it for the PS5s.
**Get yourself a 60 40 portfolio**

60% PLTR shares 

40% OTM PLTR weeklies
#IMAGINE THINKING THERE WILL BE A PULLBACK ON PLTR LMAO
Gonna leave my job Ive been at for a month to work for Boeing. Calls on BA
morning BABA calls?
25 today PLTR 
A little upward movement in BABA now
SPY dips -0.10%.
Hedge funds, institutions and CNBC analysts : Hmmmm, excellent buying opportunities.
Applied to an internship at the federal reserve, doing it not so much for the experience as I am to try to thank jpow for all the tendies
Did NIO insult supreme leader Xi or something? If they did its over
50% cash (13k) thinking 5k into pltr 25c 12/24. What do you think?
Waiting for market to open and sell my safe stocks and YOLO into Palantir 
I've watched PLTR be red after hours and pre market for over a week and mfers in here panicking about -3% after a 25% run in two days. Probably shouldn't hold the days before Thanksgiving. Or sell and wait to buy, God forbid, the dip. Doesn't matter. Watch this market still forgive you special fucks and pltr finishes green another 5%. Are you gonna sell even then? Fuck no.
Meme stocks up +80% this month and they have 1 red day.. [WSB Reaction ](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/cnu2RrM)
PLTR isn't going below 20
Waiting to see how much my well diversified 50 meme stock portfolio will be down today, after being up 17% since last Mon
The only economic indicator I use is Fast Money on CNBC. If theyre bullish I go 50% cash. Bearish I go all in with leverage.
Name a more iconic duo: mango and calling the top
The dip buyers are the real MVPs. Sellers....this is why we cant have nice things, this is why we get bear markets 
NIOOOOOOO!!! *HIGH PITCH GIRL SCREAMING*
Hope yall took a second mortgage to buy this pltr dip
Scared money don't lose money
Im not racist but I am probably going to sell most of my calls today
PLTR comeback yeahhh
Last chance this lifetime for PLTR below $23.
I lost so much money when I woke up today...
My NIO calls are gonna be absolutely wrecked
if it continues like this that boy aint getting no PS5 anymore
Whatever happens today I just hope everyone has fun and an obligatory fuck you to those calling for a big correction yet
They are talking about us again on squak
Pickle

Lickin

The more irrational the news, the better the market reacts.

DOW 35k if Trump comes out as gay
Easily dumping a fuck ton in to PLTR calls when its super low today
Whats the play today fellas? Still PLTR?
If you arent buying the PLTR dip, literally get a test to see if you have extra chromes
Fuckkkk PLTR leaving without me
AAPL gang stand back and stand by.
Pltr is going to open up in the green
with PLTR you have two scenarios. You either make money or you make more money. Choose wisely

otm 11/27c
Jesus christ PLTR lemme catch a dip
I have never seen retard strength in any stock like PLTR is showing. What the actual fuck is going on?
I'm guessing we aren't selling PLTR until it hits 50?
Here's how high PLTR is going

What's the highest number you can tell somebody it's going to without laughing

That's the number
If you dont buy this PLTR youre grade A retarded
Locked in a 2500% PLTR PROFIT LETS GOOO
Sold stocks then bought PLTR. You fucks better be right. I still need to pay my student loans LMAO
Which of you just bought PLTR calls?
CRSR is going to $60. Mark my words
This giant red dildo youre seeing on PLTR? Yours truly FINALLY fomoed in at 25.68 - and it PROMPTLY went the other way. I have the absolute shit touch. Im sorry.
Love waking up to a 13k loss
Come WSB gang, lets make Cramers head explode by continuing to pump these meme stocks with the sheer power of our retardation
I bought the CRSR dip
bruh want to buy CRSR dip, but it keeps dipping
Holy shit someone give the GME guys a fucking medal. These people are saints, literally supporting children with autism financially and giving them purpose.
PLTR getting ready for the $2.00 mid day pump
**Don't do that CRSR... Don't give me Hope**
finally. just passed $90k. shits been teetering at 89 for 2 days.
Gave in. All in PLTR. First ever yolo. Lets fucking see.
I have shares only in CRSR and PLTR. Lets ride lol
HOW DARE YOU UNDERESTIMATE THE RETARDATION OF NIO HOLDERS
Finally PLTR liftoff
pltr ur so beautiful and natural gorgeous bb
/u/rainythursdays I typed all this for you and then your comment was deleted!

Step 1. Be ready to lose it all

Step 2. Don't buy anything expiring this week

Step 3. Study option chains for a ticker you're interested in, and buy something with high open interest and volume (SPY, AAPL)

Step 4. Decide what direction you think it'll go, buy either calls or puts accordingly (the price of a contract is multiplied by 100, so you want something around 4.50 or so, to account for fees)

Step 5. Sell when you've gained or lost a little bit, don't actually YOLO (the knowledge you gain from just watching little movements repeatedly is much more important than dumb luck of a YOLO hitting)

Step 6. Make sure you don't get flagged for pattern day trading
Imagine being low income and in actual need of stimulus dollars because you got laid off from your hospitality service job while your government flips you the finger and engages in total fukery since at least June. I don't know how much clearer they can make it that they don't give a fuk about you, regardless of which side of the isle you sit on or who you support. let them eat cake amirite?
ok google whats 12% compounded daily for a month
I made more on palantir today than im going to make on my paycheck this week
PLTR TO 30 EOD
Peter Thiel world's third richest man @ end of next week
Pltr 30 LES GOOOOO
PLTR buy high sell in the stratosphere
Do I buy more PLTR
Someone bought 3300 1/22/21 PLTR 40C lol. Check the option chain
I love how the real retards at r/investing is in denial that its a bubble while wsb is aware that its a bubble but making tendies
My PLTR 30c 1/15 are +340%. Still holding (sold half)
This place is so much better when we're all making money. We should just ban the bears
i finally figured out how to enable options. i dont know a single fundamental but managed to spend 400 bucks on PLTR $30 12/31. i don't even know what the company does.
this the most bullish red day ever
Palantir going for another ATH
PLTR GANG
im buying pltr at top, just wanna be included :(
PLTR 32 EOW
I HOPPED ON THE PLTR TRAIN. 500 SHARES @ $27.
PLTR IS GOING CRAZY
Im officialy getting the PLTR ticker tattooed on my forehead if it hits 32 today
It's Friday morning, 6am EST.   
PLTR is down 50 cents pre market.  
Cue retards shrieking about it "drilling" and spamming refresh on their walmart smart phones.   


It's Friday afternoon, PLTR blows through the $30 sell wall with no resistance. $30 becomes new support level.  
Cue retards asking if there is still time to get in (as they have every day for the previous 2 weeks).
Time in PLTR >>>> timing PLTR
+270% on these PLTR calls that were down 50% on Friday. I can't even.
MAKE SURE YOU PLTR 
I got excited about PLTR but in reality Im just making lost money back
man PLTR's organic growth is amazing
even the biggest of pltr bulls gotta be feeling nervous right now.
PLTR $60bn+ market cap now

Should be right around $100bn for fair value.

Source: My dirty asshole
PLTR is literally Jesus Christ resurrecting
Soros -> $ROPE
So it turns out yesterdays PLTR 13% gain was actually a dip

if youre worried about PLTR dumping then youre a pussy, this shit only goes up. 50$ by Christmas
I expected to double my money on PLTR.    I did not expect it to happen in 12 days.
Who's holding 11/27 PLTR calls until Friday?
Shoutout to all my fellow Palantirians!
Where are the profit takers
PLTR GOOOOO
Imagine opening up some autistic reddit for 30 seconds, seeing spam for a mooning stock, and making more money than someone doing super due diligence on non-meme stocks
[deleted]
PLTR $35 eod
We are officially in the era of meme stocks, DD is dead.
The best entry point was a week ago, the next best entry point is right now.

Reminder that PLTR is not a meme stock and has legit and awesome long term potential
There is someone downvoting every comment that mentions Palantir.  Luckily I prefer my tendies with extra salt.
whoever told me to sell PLTR 27C 11/27. YOU CAN FUCK OFF
PALANTIR FOR 2024 PRESIDENT
Ive gotten way to desensitized to money. My portfolio up 100% in a week but its not enough still
The fact that sold my pltr calls for 130% profit and today I would sitting at 2000% has me depressed
Bought 100 more PLTR shares
BUY PLTR NOW ITS DIPPING
come on PLTR GANG LETS GOOOOOOO
Trump bragging about ATH yesterday was a dead giveaway to end the rally
Like clockwork, when Trump waddles his fat ass out and brags about the stock market you just know the next day is going to be red. Make America Great Again by shutting your fuckin mouth
If you dont buy the BABA dip, you ain't black
Everybody here ready to jump off buildings and me seeing the premarket is flat  you guys are really weird.
Nutted but PLTR still sucking 
This PLTR pump is reaching meme-platinum status
All last night WSB was bragging about being the new force in the market. Now the favorite meme stocks are getting nuked from orbit
Dear Tendie Jesus, please let PLTR continue on it's way up and I'll never slap a child again.
PLTR bulls to the bears during premarket: "Ah help call an ambulance!"

Fuck it, Im buying even more PLTR 
I deposited 2k into Robinhood and put it into PLTR

I don't even have 2k in my bank account.
Tesla lets fly 
Why so much red? Did we rediscover covid is happening or MMs taking profit and buy the dip?

Also, fuck you BABA and AAPL, you ignorant sluts.
Tesla looking ready to run again today
Zero memes in this thread. Confirmed mega dump at open
PLTR 


Operation Warp Speed is using a software platform named Tiberius, which was developed by Palantir, to help local health officials decide where to allocate vaccine doses. The software will help the federal government allocate the amount of vaccines each state will receive, and local officials will use Tiberius to decide where every allocated dose will go  from local doctors offices to large medical centers, according to a press release. 

This means PLTR will likely rise the whole december with a few dips to buy.

PLTR 
imagine thinking economic reports matter. Just buy calls idiots
Oh baba being a little stinky stonk she just teasing,green by open
Looks like Im bagholding rest of the week. Ill be back to check my portfolio next week
My BABA gains are in shambles
LET ME IN!!! I HAVE DIPS TO BUY!!!! 
Back into EV stocks this morning.  The two Chinese EV companies being investigated are unheard of companies.  The market is fine.  Take your PLTR profits and put them into safe EV companies like HCAC, and TH\`CB.
Bought a TSLA put yesterday. Looks like I can have a Double Big Mac instead of regular today.
Lol everyone needs to calm down. We will be fine today. If we see dips, dont be the fool to sell discounted shares. 
Guys I just woke up and haven't checked the stock market since 8 pm yesterday, are my PLTR and TSLA FDs gonna print?

2. Vaccine pump and dump

3.  EV pump and dump
I just bought pltr shares in my buy and hold portfolio. I'm drinking the Kool aid
I like how all the meme stocks are down 8%+ BLNK, NIO, SOLO, NKLA, LI....

But PLTR has retard strength.  Kinda like an autistic chimp.  It's warming up for it's daily ATH run.

I'm getting hard just thinking about it.

closing my brokerage app till friday. take PLTR to 40 for me retards
Out here doing gods work, in another 200 shares of PLTR at $25
Robinhood should take a quick picture of the person that buys your contracts to make it more personal. I wanna know who these retards are.
Damn the bullish sentiment here and elsewhere is nothing i've ever seen before. I know the cnn fear index is still moderate but the facts on the ground support extreme mania. Even people in my real life have downloaded robinhood and dumped their life savings into the top. I am dumbfounded

&#x200B;

edit: as u/Bluerigg mentioned, it has been upgraded to extreme greed. This means we still have 1000 points to squeeze the life out of bears. Carry on..
Deepfuckingvalue GME bagholder update coming at end of day

PLTR DD: Everyone gets their w2 paycheck post thanksgiving and fomos to $35
If any sports icon ever represented WSB, it's Diego Armando Maradona. He made tons of money but spent it all on hookers and cocaine. And I have a feeling if he could restart his life, he won't change a damn thing.

Gonna go take a shower. When I get out PLTR better be at $28
If you don't own any PLTR make sure you donate your brain to science so they can determine how one without a single groove in their brain was able to live so long
Every Tuesday my dog goes to puppy school and they send a report card. My boy received top marks yesterday and they said he was a model student! Such a proud dad moment, gettin a little emotional. About to head to the pet store and buy a shit load of toys and treats
Everyone just needs to pull out of chinese EV and regroup into PLTR for tendies.
I dont understand why people are crying about PLTR. Its just back to the price at 3:30pm yesterday lol
Palantir has straight up retard strength

PLTR paid for an engagement ring, next the whole wedding!!!!
PLTR YOU BEAUTIFUL WHORE
#HELLO LOSER WHO MISSED OUT ON PLTR HAHAHAHAHHAA
IM JACKED TO THE TITS IN PUTS
Not gonna lie, I didnt expect PLTR to hit $20 but Im now convinced that WSB definitely has influence on whether these stocks soar or not. Gonna note that for next meme stock....
Wtf is going on with chines EVs I was told Stonks only go up?
Mango never held a QQQ 300 press conference 
ima call it.. evs end green today.
Besides PLTR and TSLA, anyone yoloing into some other dip today?
Yes, college degrees will make you millions more over your lifetime on average unless you go into trades like welding.

No, it is not a good idea to drop out, unless you are in humanities or some pointless liberal arts crap.

Of course dropping out worked for Bill Gates and Zuckerberg, they were already rich.
Diamond Hands for PLTR Today Boys. Buckle up.
Cramer did this
Todays thread WHY IS ___ RED?!
The whole market could end green and people panicking from some dips...

Tesla green eod

Cars have recalls...nothing new. Not gonna scare me away

Buy PLTR, literally up 5% two seconds later.

Looking to buy more
PLTR only goes up... whats happening
I know this this a smallstreetbets type of gain but for the second week in a row a $100 option has made me $700 and damn it feels good.
This week I made decent gains on stocks I know nothing about. You guys are now my financial advisors.
PLTR BABY 
I know red days are good for the market but it always makes me a little sad. I only like to see my stonks go up
Think I'm going to pull some profits and actually pay off some debt.

NAH JUST KIDDING BOYS LET IT RIIIIIDE
CRSR is just refueling before it takes off and deep dicks Jim Cramer in the food hole.
Nio incredibly resilient.  I think 58-60 by end of week even with the off day tomorrow
Ok Im done milking PLTR whats the next move
*my brain at 9:31am buying calls:* **LEEROY JENNKINSSSSS**

*my brain at 10:30am:* my dude what the fuck?? its Wednesday and markets are closed tomorrow + they close early on Friday **why tf did you buy FDs??**
PLTR knows Im going to buy more PLTR before I even know Im going to buy more PLTR, what an amazing company.
THC B is running
Who panic sold PLTR when it dropped 50 cents show yourself you fucking retard
PLTR gives you a chance and you dont jump in. Then you hate free money.

Cutting down on sugar is a bitch. Still cant believe I feel some withdrawal symptoms. No honey in my morning tea. No dessert unless I actively go after it. The only sugary snacks I got are Nature Valley granola bars and 92% dark chocolate. Almost a month in and things are starting to get boring.
"Please keep the shitposting to a minimum" LOL

Selling PLTR is unamerican
PLTR is trading itself by getting alpha from WSB
Tesla: 'Call an ambulance..................................but not for me!'

We're living in a simulation, no way this shit is real.
_BREAKING NEWS_

Palantir Technologies to partner with Sony in order to supply PS5 consoles to wsb members
Breaking news:  PLTR has now been deemed to be its own sector
PLTR new support at 27$
Lmao at all the tools claiming morality about PLTR. Why dont you stop using Google fb msft and every other company who pimps out your data and sells it. Stop using Verizon and ATT, 23&me who do the same. Stop going on 90% of websites who explicitly warn you theyre tracking you and selling everything they know about you to third parties
Finally PLTR liftoff

There is still some time left to get on board.
PLTR is a fucking tank. RIP to those who sold at 20.
The activity on $WORK calls this past week has been very suspicious to say the least.

It is clear some animals are more equal than others in this market lol

Wish I got some insider information too
Finally PLTR liftoff

There is still some time left to get on board.
PLTR 30+ on Friday
This is easily the most fun cult I've ever been a part of.
that $27 wall got wrecked
Finally PLTR liftoff

There is still some time left to get on board.
Fuck it, 11 bagger and Im holding. PLTR my best friend
Lol. Pltr 28 eod ?
My analysis is garbage, just buy WSB meme stocks. Got it
I am the Palantir 
how high can pltr go? imagine power hour if it keeps this rate
PLTR holy fuckkkkkkkk
JESUS CHRIST

PLTR is changing lives
PLTR 30 EOD?
I love everyone here. I have no idea what the fuck I am doing but I just put 1.5k into PLTR. My kids can get Christmas gifts from their mom.
Dropped another 2k on PLTR at the bottom 5 seconds ago
Would it be  possible to make a mega post for PLTR? I love that peeps are making bank on it, but its  eating up the whole feed
NIO is fucking heading to green people. Hope you bought the dip today
PLTRRR
My kids are going to get a weekly allowance of 0.00089 PLTR at this rate
Gosh damn. How long do I hold my PLTR 12/31 ITM calls. Ive never been in this position
Everyone talking about "ohh i need a re-entry point to PLTR" well here it is, in front of your eyes.
Loved selling my WORK calls this morning for a loss
Bought that PLTR dip. Now back to 27 plz.
**Friendly reminder that markets are closed tomorrow and close early on Friday**
lmao PTLR rebounding so fast
NIO plz just break even
[$WORK too easy](https://imgur.com/a/4CyqQJA)
Pivot from PLTR to MGNI.  Only $19 a share with $1b market cap and mooning 8% a day
bought 400 GME shares without even thinking about it this morning. and here I am trying to find the best $/lb price for mixed legos on craigslist.
I'm looking right into my webcam as I jerk off tonight, I want to thank my FBI agent
PLTR soon spying on us from above 40
Mods need to just make a PLTR thread so these PLTR people can all just yell at one another
Bought 360 shares of PLTR ! Lets ride boys!
Just broke 100k, up 50k in less than a month: [https://ibb.co/HVh6qCM](https://ibb.co/HVh6qCM)
guys PLTR is the reason you browse this forum. Get the fuck in here
PLTR $30 EOD 
Is PLTR Gonna keep going? Lmao
This isnt the top for PLTR. Digital surveillance and data monitoring grow every single day. Its almost all poorly managed. A company that can fill the niche to build organized databases and process raw intelligence is poised to dominate for decades. Theyre already balls deep with the US gov and Id fully expect them to expand internationally. I dont know what the ceiling is but its sure as shit not 30.
PLTR going to get the boomer bump after their kids tell them about gains over Thanksgiving?
was down 50% on my portfolio this morning. PLTR brought me back from the dead.
Im up $85k, not selling PLTR
PLTR HOLY FUCK MY MANSSSSSS
SOROS:  Stop the count!  
Someone call that guy
when PLTR 50 was a meme 12 hours ago
my net worth is fastly approaching 7 figures
There is some REAL autism in PLTR right now, levels weve never seen before
So let me get this straight.

PLTR is a COVID, TECH, CONSULTING, EV, GOV, MILITARY, LOGISTICS, BIG DATA, AI, INFRASTRUCTURE play??

Did I miss anything else?
Will PLTR destroy 29 by 1:30?  I think yes
ALL THE MORNING PLTR HATERS I WAS BEEFING WITH R DELETING THEIR COMMENTS WHRRE YALL AT PULL THE FUCK UP
MGNI is the move. Dont get left out.
PLTR FOR THE WWWW
I LOVE YOU PALANTIR
PS5 sales are going to skyrocket because of PLTR. LONG $SNE
PLTR FOR 30 EVERYBODY BUYYY
Please, PLTR, slow down. My refractory period!  


26c 1/15/21
DONT SELL PLTR YOU PUSSIES
Did you all see PLTR is going to be working on vaccine distribution? Fuck. I'm holding on to my 02/21 15c. Up more than 300% now
Sold my 22c 11/27 PLTRs earlier today for a 700% profit and they doubled again since I sold them. Were goin back in boys. 30c 11/27
PLTR is gonna make us all spacex Planeteers
We're all gonna be sitting at the table during Thanksgiving talking about how rich we got from PLTR which is gonna trigger a boomer buying frenzy!
Im pregnant with tsla calls, i let it cum inside me for the last 5 weeks 
Closing the day out with a 13K win, closing all of my positions. Happy Thanksgiving guys, see you all on Monday!
Bout to be the last time you see PLTR in the 28's
Exit strategy on PLTR? I keep locking profits and rolling calls, but it has to end somewhere
$29 
Why didnt I buy more PLTR. I remember when it hit 16 and that was huge
Holy fuck PLTR is gunning for $30 EOD. What do you guys have your stop losses set at?
PLTR DIAMOND HANDS
Bought pltr during the ipo, not really worried about much right now

PLTR is going dicks out for Harambe
#PLTR SMASH
Have you guys heard about this indie stock called PLTR?
I think they make peanuts or something. ALL IN
Browsing /r/stocks last night. Top post is about how no one wants to buy meme stocks because of the 'inherit risk'.

      

These people would have passed on Amazon and Apple at ATLs.
Remember when palantir was at 9.50 and you werent sure if it would go down to 9.30 or up to 9.70 and that was considered a risky play. Damn wish I could go back to those days.
ITS DIPPING BUY MORE PLTR
Im sooooo ducking horny
Okay so I FOMOd PLTR all in! Does that mean this is the top?
I closed my pltr calls this morning for 100% gain!! Would be 650% now. 

PTLR 30 EOD?
Being real here in 3 months people will feel fucking retarded for not buying PLTR under $30.
Morpheus looking at PLTR:  Hes beginning to believe...
You guys PLTR is up 20 fucking percent. it NEEDS to dip and consolidate. Just hold lol
THCBB MINUS B
Good fucking morning boys who tf is ready to pump PLTR straight into the heavens
pltr opening green lol
PLTR strong like bull
Wow I just did some research and pltr is an actual company with legit ceo and government contracts its not some rando No name EV. This shit is easily hitting 100+ in 2021. Keep buying shares
NIO is legit. Cant speak for other Chinese EVs but Im buying NIO dip
PLTR green by open
Cant believe palantir recovered
Ok WSB, everyone buy 100 PLTR shares. Lets go. Thrusters and gains.
Just signed my divorce paperwork so my soon to be ex wife can marry her boss at the job I got her. Im literally the actual embodiment of this sub 

Kill me plz

NIO SHARES ALL IN
PLTR is going to Mars, maybe 1 quick stop at the moon but everybody eating in the $PLTR gang 
PLTR is the next PLTR
I sold pltr at 20 and I'm FOMOING THE FUCK BACK IN!!!
PLTR: What moon? Saturn here I come!
PLTR 30 eod or I go to work today with an anal plug in
Congrats kids, I was just brainwashed into yoloing the rest of my account into PLTR
Think tesla can push 600 today?
Conservative prediction on when/if PLTR could hit 40? Currently holding March calls and a bunch of shares.

*you guys all over the map.
PLTR 
Will the Wall Street degenerates please stand up !?!?!?!
$FSR a BUY by Citigroup with $26PT
##A moment of silence please for the fallen meme autists 
My short for CRSR was rejected just as it shot down another 4% fuck you TD
I watched a vid that walks through Toronto, basically theyre in lockdown now.
Loaded with NIO, TSLA. plug and Xpev callsZ absolutely sick thinking about how much Im gonna be down at open
Tsla was 569 4 hours ago.... Fuck me
Unless you have weeklies on nio chill the fuck out
I knew being up 30k+ over last week should of been a sign to exit these EV calls . If only I sold all before today
You guys realize PLTR is like $2.40 above yesterdays low right?
So many pussies are going to sell TSLA at open.
My buying Opp for NIO has finally arrived
DO WE HOLD OUR 11/27 PLTR CALLS?
Tesla really opened pre marker around $570 just to give my 12k weeklies comfort now its dying wow
I have some rather unfortunate news to report to everyone here: if you are dumb you wont make it far in life.

But the good news is you are exactly in the right place if that is the case. By playing a game of chance that relies on absolutely zero intellectual ability, youve evened out the odds.

Maybe you autists know what you are doing after all.
Order in for 100 shares of PLTR @ 22.50 and I bet it doesnt fill.

Buy. The. Dip.
Perfect, Tesla is giving everyone an opportunity to jump back in! To the moon boys!
I am literally laughing out loud at how distorted our view of the market is. Imagine knowing a week ago that this place would be crying over TSLA DROPPING all the way to 545. You can't make this shit up. We need therapy.
Please PLTR do not dip. Just one more morning to mid day of mediocre climbage into the 24s is all I truly ask
FYI for anyone reading this thread not in meme stocks:

The only people acting doom and gloom are those in meme stocks. 


Getting more PLTR at open
I have $500 I dont mind losing. Whats a good YOLO that isnt PLTR or NIO
Back into tech boys. Daddy Bezos and Tim Apple have a warm cup of tea ready for you after Xi Jinping socializes your buttholes

Please god let me buy this glorious dip before other fuckers beat me to it
NIO $65 eod.

Alexa Play In The Arms Of An Angel for Chinese EV call holders
Were crashing because of that post saying we control the market

This is the big boys pushing back
We are the big boys now, the market will pump today, just relax.
Bought 200 more shares of pltr and averaged down after buying ATH yesterday idgaf
Now everyone calm the fuck down it's not even 9:00am
I concede NOTHING!
Would y'all still trade this way without this sub/thread?

Assuming you knew/realized it existed, if you didn't have us all here to cheer you on; would you still yolo 5k on those Tesla options that expire this friday?

Are we really doing this all for the screenshots??

Fucking mid-morning crisis
So picking up SPY puts eod yesterday wasnt a bad idea. Everyone was making fun of me
I still believe there is a WSB 2.0, change my mind. 
Et tu, CRSR?
Most bulls here sold yesterday with their profits. They will look for reentry points today for solid stocks.
I literally just dumped all my Amazon and Microsoft because they were so obviously underperforming the market over the last 3 months. Cool, cool.
Panopticon Living Today Runs.

Robin Hood crash incoming
Whose loading up on Chinese ev companies this morning?
When I saw $CRSR was -7% premarket earlier I was worried, but then I realized that it's a god tier stock and this MFer is ending green
TSLA calls at open
Haha PLTR, crazy.. damn bears

i fucking love gambling
Fuck i just bought PLTR at 26 
Remember everyone if you need to screenshot it, you need to sell it!! Take those tendies home with you 
CRSR support thread where are you
a family member of mine is apparently a true autist and a memegod. Super conservative boomer. He hates stonks and doesnt trade AT ALL, but he made the greatest trade of all time. Just found out he's balls deep in a meme stock as an early investor before the IPO and his net worth fluctuates a mil a day basically. No wonder he's been in a crazy good mood lately.
BUY THE PLTR DIP
PLTR $5,000 PROFIT IN A WEEK ON CALLS FUCKING YOLO
somehow CRSR is now 80% of my portfolio
Pltr 30 eow seems p likely imo
Sell PLTR at open. Wait for the dip buy back in rinse repeat rinse repeat
alibaba
What is you price target for PLTR? Infinity?

CRSR coming through with the early Black Friday sale.  
Just in time to ride up through Cyber Monday.
Driving to my shitty day job itching to refresh my autism account of 100% PLTR
Is it too late to get in? Should I get X stock before it moons?? These questions mean nothing. Its the same as a poker player asking the guy next to him what card the dealer will lay down next. No one fuckin knows so just lay your bets and hope for the best.
In all seriousness, are we really expecting PLTR to hit $30 by EOY?
Is PTLR even a real stock
BUY PLTR GUYS
PLTR pump in progress, keep pushing WSB, $28 coming shortly
Guys. Stop screamin PLTR 26. Every time it gets close you autists REEEEE at it and you scare it away. Let it come to us and make us the tendies. We want 26 to feel welcome so we can be 50 EoY.

I broke the stock market... every time I sell a stock it pops .... so I bought 1000 shares of PLTR at $10.00 and I sell 1 share every hour or so and then the stock pops .... free money

PLTR. I gotta say. Ive never seen returns like this. I have FOSO. Fear of selling out. Is that a thing?
Boy we really bout to get PLTR to 100 simply by retard strength
Feels weird that I have to go to work soon when I just got 2 weeks worth of pay in half a day from a meme stonk
Is this even allowed? I've never seen anything like it
Took profits and expecting a small pullback at 30. Then time to reenter for the 6th time. PLTR is a cash cow
I love whoever gave me the DD to invest on PLTR at 13
Does this mean PLTR was mispriced at IPO?

PLTR gonna correct today. Buy on red days!
Unrealized premarket gains are the best kind of gains 
Oh there's a PLTR dip again...? Guess we buying calls.
I was scared  might be a penny pump and dump and set limit sells but this premarket got me thinkin it might be real deal like NIO and PLTR were.

I dont want it to be true, but this always seems to happen after peak euphoria and a lot of people were laughing about free money yesterday
Tesla its been an absolute pleasure, keep doing your thing 
They killed CIIC, you bastards! 
Healthy pullback for PLTR. Pltr is giving yall retards that miss out to buy it for cheap
LMAO RIP MY 12k TSLA WEEKLIES 
Daddy Elon.. who hurted you 
okay, before all of your paperhands sell of all the EV they have in a big panick sell off because of the Investigation....
Dont forget that China has inplemented Project Blue Horizon couple of years ago ro move to an Emmissionfree Country.
Today the Stocks will be red yes, most likely. So what they will be fine.
Also dont forgrt that all those EVs are backed by the Government.
They only exist because of Project Blue Horizon. China is pushing this hard.
WSB is not the Market Maker. The Sell off is logical because Algos dont like uncertainty and all you Guys are way to late. Most of you dont even know what an Algo is.
Just chill and wait.
If you wanna sell go ahead I dont care.
Myfreecams.com addiction is fucking with my sleep.
If Tesla goes sub $540 today & you dont get in you hate money.
Tesla about to take me to the poor house
So how far we think PLTR is going down on this dip? I've got an optimistic buy order in for 500 shares at just under 22, wondering if it will fill.
Today isn't going to be fun
Hows PLTR pre market?
Buy low. 

Sell high.  

Don't cum in crazy.
Imagine crying over this sell off after these past 2-3 weeks.

Nio gonna at least make a 5 percent recovery at open or some shit. Just need a quick 10 bagger
Sooo, NIO is a real company, right? Were not gonna all get NKLAd are we? I sold half my NIO shares when I was +94%, so Im gonna let em roll house money for 10yrs... if theyre a real company haha.
So buying this EV dip in everything now BLNK, NIO, XPEV?
As long as PLTR holds 23, we're good guys, buy it up there, its new support
I think we're green by 9:45

Good time to get into CRSR?
PLTR is literally the first line of defense in modern warfare (data). Think Raytheon, Lockheed etc. This is a data defense contractor with Uncle Sam and the Pentagon and other world governments knocking on its door.
TSLA has risen 
NIO... you are the one. Rising from the ashes.
PLTR is trading itself: PLTR is beating the market
CRSR green eod, you heard it here first
PLTR is going To hit $27 at or by 12PM calling it
I am but a simple man. 

I see NIO dip, I buy that dip.
Fun fact: there is no one ever that lost money on PLTR
TSLA entering ludicrous mode
Can anyone slaughter a bear for the pltr gods ?
Pltr free money gang
Greatest wealth transfer in history and y'all cheering for a few thousand in profit as the country goes to shit and future generations buried in debt.

Easy money in meme stonks. I cant believe these professional boomers are down -10% in 2020

NIO stop baby, you look so god damn sexy in green , take off that red dress and let me fuck you in the ass.
Damn I've been waiting for a good entry point to double down on PLTR and it's never come lmaoo
I quite literally sell everything at the wrong time
I just realized on Monday I accidentally bought a PLTR Call $23 12/04 instead of selling a covered call against my 1000 shares. Being Retarded pays off again.
the next time you feel bad about your plays just remember there's someone out there holding Kodak at a $60 cost basis

i think ima buy some pltr merch 

kinda fire tho ngl
MGNI doesnt know what a dip is
There is massive volume on the 310P on SPY 1/25/2021.

Over 100,000 contracts were executed in the last 12 hours.

It's either a massive million dollar hedge -20% OTM or people are getting ready to fuck main street.
YALL WERE SUPPOSED TO TELL ME ABOUT WORK  
YAL FAKE
Im literally up $131K this past month (NIO, PLTR, TWO, TSLA are the only things that have changed in my portfolio after listening to some of you guys). Ive posted positions in some of my other comments. Those and the other pieces of the portfolio hitting have been awesome. Guess Ill say thanks since its that time of the year and all.
I will also give away 2 PS5s once PLTR hits $40. I promise
I bet I can lose money with PLTR.
Fuck you NIO you stupid fucking cock sucker
PLTR IS GOD
For those who watch PLTR daily, what time of day does it make he biggest moves
What to add to my portfolio, only have pltr

Edit: Thanks everyone, double downed on pltr, fuck diversity!
Cmon PLTR gang. We cant give up now
CRSR stop being gay.
PLTR is running to 30 by next week whether you like it or not
Fuck it, Im in. Bought PLTR calls for Dec and Jan. First time buying a meme stock instead of SPY
To all my PLTR call holders, what Porsche 911 spec you going for?
Are my CRSR boys holding on?
pltr is giving me the "and here's another gift i got you! do u like it???" vibe. like a girl you've started dating, you really like her, but now you're wondering "maybe this is going too fast"
some bears were saying PLTR was gonna drop -50% to $12 today 

lmao

PLTR $30 EOD and Ill make pecan pies
Thanks PLTR for a PS5 every day
Rotation out of everything into PLTR
PLTR going to drive through $30 like a fucking semi truck hitting a fly.
Pltr making me Wana vomit cuz I sold my calls at 26.50. 
So we just never sell PLTR?
PLTR  Absolutely insane

PLTRStreetBets

When I bought PLTR at 9/share, this sub was full of PLTR bears at near and a bit after IPO. I was bullish, thats why I bought, but I didnt anticipate to make 200% return in less than a month. Why the sudden wave of bullish sentiment on this stock/company?
someone give me a name of the next meme stock, preferably a company that nobody knows what they do please
Losing on BABA but PLTR And TSLA are supplying the thanksgiving tendies

One year later, can we talk about SPCE 35c again 
I bought a bunch of stock in PLTR at 18$.
What's a good sell point for this? Does it stop?!
If this market was a Botox party, there would be bursted foreheads & lips all over the place. 
PLTR really gonna hit 30 today huh?
Would be insane if PLTR closed at $30 today. And its not an unrealistic goal at this point.

Buy the PLTR dip not gonna last long
Theres no reasons Tesla or PLTR will slow down, dont regret another day of not being a part of the gain orgy.
Are we still buying PLTR?
PLTR is literally a deus ex machina for my portfolio
Watching some of you tards screech about a minor premarket pullback after an epic rally is highly expected & entertaining.
Can I just be a reasonable voice for some people, just because a stock that has been performing very well has a pullback does not mean it is in a "BUBBLE" Its completely natural to have up and down ticks, the fact that a stock ever receives consecutive upticks speaks more to the confidence people have in the stock
Friendly reminder that the current pre-market value of PLTR is still above yesterdays opening. Don't go paper hands.
No way the majority of you guys were here in March-June, this -.10% is nothing
12k Tesla weeklies, 10k calls of NIO , LI, and Xpev . Im gonna be ruined at open boys
Buy the $PLTR dip
I will never financially recover from this
HOLY SHIT IM BUSY THESE DAYS LAUNGHING AT PEOPLE WHO DOESNT BUY PLTR

You think Cramer is reading this thread? Crying with a clinched fist? The odds are high, and so am I. PLTR. $27. EOD
Really want to throw more into PLTR..

Maybe Ill drop out now and go work for Elon

At least we are still getting good memes.
Damn, so everyone that said PLTR will be ripping tomorrow really meant that it will be ripping all of our assholes
As a NIO shareholder you probably want them doing investigations on Chinese EVs. If they pass it assists them in their eventual global expansion.

When we buying PLTR? Dip at open?
[damn I called it](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k03375/_/gdhei5x/?context=1)
PLTR is simply taking a small break before it enters the second inning of this massive bull run. Incoming hammer cock green candles get in there boys
Yesterday PLTR started with a dip, today the premarket is in the 22s...tards place your orders at open and cum as hard as your micropenis allows when it inevitably rises to 25 EOD

Why are  acting like the market is gonna be  red. Its fucking flat you stupid bear
I feel guilty I sold all my MSFT for PLTR... its like I gave up on the nerdy friend to be with the cool jock. He might have let me down a couple times recently but he deserved better

Nio deliveries out next week.  Prepare yourselves.
Sooo can we go back to pumping CRSR now?

There goes PLTR PLTRing again 
chats moving so fast no one can see that I'm gay
i dont have enough money to buy thousands of PLTR shares so i only bought one :) hope this will help me learn something about stocks
Sell your winnings and enjoy your time with family. Itll feel so much better.

If AAPL could just go up and quit with this seesaw shit that would be great, thanks.
CRSR I need you to go back up to like 51+
PLTR 30c 12/18 ! thoughts?
The safety guy at work just told me after 2008 his credit score was in the double digits. What a fucking legend
But seriously, is there a specific reason or news on CRSR?
I bought GME for 13 and sold for 11...

I assumed this short squeeze just wasn't coming, guess I was just early
BABA DABA DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Why GME mooning?
is GME about to infinity squeeze to $100 today
CRSR needs to check their vibe
BABA my YAGA

Idk why I cant make money
Can tesla become a dumb anime character and make a massive comeback through the power of friendship or some shit?
Lmao the premiums on CRSR are still so fucked. The stock needs to go up by like 60% to double your position. Might as well just buy shares.
TSLA

Ive been aggressively buying NIO calls all morning hbu
Scared money don't make money but mine is petrified
I bought a TSLA 505 call for $375 last Wednesday and sold it for $400. Right now that call is worth $5800. Makes my stomach turn thinking about it
Anyone else happy theyre making money but low key ashamed because all they do is invest in meme stocks?
TSLA always comes through and I love it
Buy the CRSR dip?
Mmm SPCE 
Bow before your AI overlord  PLTR
My 1/15 PLTR calls have made so much... must... diamond hand... 
If TSLA could just get up to +5% I could stop staring at it and get some work done...
RIP maradona you were a real legend
RIP Maradona
RIP Maradona 

He was one of us
Pissed off that I missed out on PLTR from $11, so bought T H C B at $11 instead.

#Ultimate retard moves
Real talk. I've been wanting to get into PLTR bit keep getting scared out because it keeps popping. It's doubled in just the month, am in stupid to get in now?
Had an option between TSLA, PLTR, and NIO. Guess which one I picked 
YOU CAN'T KEEP OUR RETARD EV PLAYS DOWN
NIO calls???
I would pay good money to get metrics on what % of options volume on meme stocks is purely from WSB
PLTR BABA AND ICLN CALLS??
IV looks high on PLTR until you realize delta gonna be cooking as this thing goes to 40
TSLA coiling up for a Mars shot
Buy a Tesla w TSLA gains

Buy a Peloton w PTON gains

Buy a ??? w PLTR gains?
Buy something, goes up a tiny bit, you sell to lock in profits, once you sell the stock starts rising again fast, you buy in again, stock tanks.
Either pltr soars past 27 eod or has a significant pre holiday sell off
CRSR
Plantronics confused af. Imagine the CEO sitting there thinking people out here buying bluetooth headsets again.
CRSR gang
Started selling options a month ago and have made better returns. I want the +10000% but I guess I'll settle with a consistent 20%
PLTR boys: what color lambo's we getting?!?!!?!?
PLTR will be working with companies on tracking where the vaccines have been placed in certain cities. This thing is going to 40 EOY.
The best thing I did was liquidating my RKT shares and yoloing into PLTR
Sold my pltr 11/27 20c for 0.55 this Monday for the same price that bought last Friday 
Im sad u sold PLTR at $25 :( oh well at least I have some gowns

Why in the Kentucky fried fuck are there so many people here referring to calls expiring in 2 weeks as LEAPS?
NIOs death was greatly exaggerated
$WORK just had a rocket placed under its ass
Imagine not buying PLTR
Maradona died, Ik for a fact that half of this sub is a cokehead and theyre in shambles rn
What did we do to deserve $PLTR?
COME ON SPY YOU FUCK JUST DIE
If I can keep making $1000 a day on PLTR that would be greeeeat
Guys Im making a book  about how pltr$ helped us escape the wage slave life
Note for those that might get confused or upset.

Maradona died... Maradona is an Argentine football manager and retired professional footballer.

Madonna, of "like a virgin" - is still alive.

You may proceed.
Whoever is keep NIO from turning green 

Your moms a fucking hoe
NIO gang still holding?
**Me:** PLTR you can do 10%.

**PLTR:** How about 15%!!!

Crsr profits = poof
PDT restrictions is the most retarded shit on the planet. Up 8k and cant do shit except be stuck holding the bag until Friday
Guys, can you speak up?  I can hardly hear you over the PLTR.
It's lunch time. Close your computer go get lunch and let those PLTR calls ride. After lunch everyone will open their computers seen PLTR down 1% or 2 from ATH and say damn what a deal. Next thing you know PLTR 28 EOD.
I just sold all my aapl shares and bought PLTR is that ok guys.
I like real estate better than stocks cause I have a hot busty realtor that I work with alot
PLTR was the first thing Ive ever bought on an IPO day
So is it better to hold PLTR calls or sell them to roll them out further? Ive got 19s I bought when it was at 13 and then some yolo 30s. 1/15 exp.
The amount of money needed to take TSLA to 590 is the same amount it took yesterday to break the 550 wall. TSLA is running out of sellers
GME short squeeze any minute now.
ICLN PLTR AND BABA CALLS
Id like to let you all know about the lord and savior, PLTR. Do you have a minute to listen about how he can save your life?
Buy the CRM dip, theyve got earnings next week
ICLN 25c next summer
PlTR 12/18 27c is a steal right now.
I'm sure George Soros is going to be in tears when his shares sell for 60% gains since he grew a conscience.
Uncle Thiel has brought my account back in the green just from shares alone. All hail the PayPal Mafia. All hail the dark lord. All hail PLTR.
Tesla to include Palantir software in all Model Xs
Rofl guy at work keeps spreading misinformation about the virus. Part of me wonders if he is trying to kill fellow coworkers on purpose
Its a simple formula.  Buy PLTR calls a week to a month out.  Profit.
Sold PLTR, made $1400 today. Im out but best of luck to everyone else still in 
PLTR flattening a bit during all the 3-martini lunches.
IF YOU SELL PLTR YOU ARENT BOUT IT
Each day since last week I qant to sell palantir, but this stupid fuck just keeps pumping. 

Where is the top here?
What are the analyst waiting for to upgrade PLTRs price target? That their buddies finish loading up on shares?
Sure, these calls started out as FDs. But now that they're in the money I'm considered a responsible options trader.
Getting my paycheck from Wendy's this Friday. Need some of that pltr
TSLA 570 today
Im going to be honest we are some greedy bulls

pussy hands be pussy
Tech baby always buy tech calls
Sold my 02/21 30c for PLTR for 160k, and dumped it all into 40c 01/22 leaps. I want a million dollars pls
Sitting on this 11/27 27c PLTR Call from early this morning.. Sitting at 305%.


HOLDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
How bad will the profit taking be when PLTR hits $30? Anyone else gonna hold past that?
CNBC boomers finally addressing PLTR 
I fucking love PLTR 
Is it too late to fomo into PLTR?
Pltr said ticket to Mars please, one way
Thought I was being stupid adding PLTR shares at 25 this morning lmao

Also just paper handed the fuck out of 26c for a 25% gain.
So obviously you cop a tesla with insane tesla gains. What do you get from PLTR gains? Im thinking a CRAZY ass crystal ball, like a real fuckin boujee one
Fucking hell the $ Ive left on the table with PLTR 
Cashed out on my PLTR $20 call at $27.80, would like to continue this wild ride but theres that old adage about pigs getting slaughter and I sure as hell made a lot of tendies on it already
thank fuck i didnt paper hands my entire PLTR holding
Moment of silence for $400k in slack weekly calls guy, who mistimed his entry and went broke
MGNI is annnn animalll
I'd always be afraid to get in on something after a big runup. PLTR was just hitting $21 and I figured I missed the train. I took the plunge and grabbed some jan $30 calls and they are up 110% already.
I keep on telling myself to buy fucking PLTR calls. And I dont because Im a bitch that knows I will buy the top. Dont worry, one day I will fomo into it and it will tank. Keep getting your tendies people.
 MGNI  
PLTR money printer go brrrrr
Holy fucking shit PLTR
MGNI getting resistance at $19.5?  The stock isn't even hard yet.  It's gonna fuck it's way to $20 today.

One day we will look at this day bois and say... PTLR was dirt cheap - PTLR to $100 and beyond.... 
Everyone is going to be like why didnt I get in on MGNI a week ago, just like you have with PLTR. 

Dont miss out on MGNI
Palantards, thank you for spamming this ticker so many times to the point where I bought in. Thanks for the tendies y'all 
Just did my part; bought 40 shares of PLTR for my boomer/hold forever account.
Im in on pltr - no way its too late
Why the fuck is my PLTR position so small
Friendship ended with Elon Musk 

Now Peter Thiel is my new best friend 
I feel like most trends on here are guaranteed $ if you catch them early enough. PLTR, SPCE, EV stonks, etc. There are some exceptions tho like when everyone bought MSFT calls before a downswing. The general trend among the majority seem to be right tho.

I wonder if this is a sort of natural selection. Person X buys options on stock A and gets rich. He survives to keep recommending similar options. Enough of these ppl and you get a trend. But we dont hear much from those who dont survive (Person Y) because they lose their $ on their options play and therefore cant recommend that play or even have the $ to back another play. And since meme stocks tend to just shoot up without much logic, it just accelerates the trend and hype on subreddits and among investors overall.
IF YOU SELL PLTR YOUR A CERTIFIED PUSSY
The fuck is wrong with MM's rejecting my order. There's literally no bid GIVE ME THE OPTION FOR A DOLLAR
Doubling down on PLTR, YOLO
took out 2 home equity lines and dumped it into pltr with margin  
Which retard just said PLTR crashing sell sell sell lmao
Where my NIO call holders at? We need to form a support group during these trying times
PLTR really gonna reach 40 by New Years
24$ 1/15 PLTR call. Should probably hold, right?
Im dumb, someone a couple weeks ago mentioned PLTR so i threw $250 on it as just a fuck it. I shouldve have dropped a couple grand on that shit.
PLTR - Remember... if it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to sell.

Bulls make money, pigs get slaughtered, etc.

and to think i thought i bought the top this morning 


Me at 9am: when PLTR dips to 23, I'll buy more.

**10am: PLTR moons to 26.**  
Me at 10am: Oh, well after such a huge run, there has to be a pullback, so I guess I'll put in a buy order at 25.

**1pm: PLTR non-stop moons to $28.50**  
Me at 1pm: COME BACK HERE AND LET ME LOVE YOU DAMN IT!  


 ****  ****  ****
PLTR WILL CONTINUE TO

These PLTR calls are the first time I've made money off options, bought them for Feb. If they keep going up I might shoot ectoplasm everywhere
Anyone remember Michael Burry's other big position back in March/April?

It was TLRD.

Shit is traded on the pink sheets (TLRDQ) now at 10 cents a share.

Every autist has his day!

Take some calls off the table on PLTR, never sell your shares
Oh no, SPY is almost red to green! Please MMs, whatever you do, please DO NOT start buying huge blocks of shares! I'm holding so many 0dte puts with my life savings rn, it would just DECIMATE me if SPY were to go red to green!!!!
Pretty sad I missed out on PLTR calls this morning. Was up before open to buy and we got a call (ambulance) and I couldn't buy. Then it was up 15% so I didn't want to fomo. Next time :(
Finally got in PLTR. 12/31 Call. Cant help but feel like I bought at the top

Hold PLTR through Thanksgiving?
PLTR LETS GOOK KEEP BUYINGGG
pltr out here putting dinner on my table
That candle is HUGE.... I'm lowkey bracing 
Lmao the greed index is at 91 
Sold my PLTR calls earlier today at $27. Wow the amount of money I left on the table smh
Here is my response to the guy who was removed for shit posting his being upset about missing PLTR 

This is a long term game, and nobody wins, you just survive. You survived this week. I had shares at 9.80 and was out at 15. Fuck me. Oh well. Blowing up is worse than missing the big one. And this is like the 20th big one this year, of which I only hit once and then lost it being a bear. There will be more. So many more speculative industries will get hot... Hydrogen, space, pharma and even more gov contracting. 

If it's actually making you suicidal you gotta talk to someone. We are all addicted to the stonk market to various extents, but IMO you should begin to develop more of a numbness than an obsession
Holy fuck PLTR gonna cross 30 son of a bitch
Why do I feel we are all going to jail for robbing Wall Street like a bunch of retards
PLTR: He bought? Pump eet
Left out 9k on the table for TSLA FDs today. GUH

PLTR let me buy that dip tho 
You fucking tards are worried about a 0.25% drop in premarket when PLTR has gone up 30% in the last week 
Day 23: Cramer has yet to figure out how to navigate this sub.  Hes asking his associates why there are so many acronyms that are not on the stock market.  Hes been searching for the FD ticker, and  it makes no sense to him.
TH CB gang ya here? We moon next week!
PLTR is officially a 5-bagger for me
No worries on PLTR, will be 30 by EOW
But the fucking dip boys!!
If you arent buying the CRSR dip, then you aint black.

PLTR up 14% with 4 more hours of trading.

I said this one hour ago when PLTR was up 10%
i can't believe this is happening. ive never been so right on a hunch like this before. I reinvested my entire portfolio (60k) into PLTR. I've now got 4300 shares @ 13.74.

for every fucking dollar it goes up I make 4.3k lol. I've already doubled my entire investment in under a month (and I haven't had health palpitations via options since I'm 100% ShareGang).
The year is 2027. PLTR becomes the first stonk to hit a share price of $1 billion
Holding PLTR till after thanksgiving. Imagine how many dinner conversations will involve people being long
PLTR $35 EOD
My PLTR story: fell asleep on Friday and didnt press buy @ 18.80 market closed. Watched it rocket Monday Tuesday. FOMOed hard today, no ragrets. Backup plan if it tanks: buy second instalment equal vol

Operation Warp Speed is using a software platform named Tiberius, which was developed by Palantir, to help local health officials decide where to allocate vaccine doses. The software will help the federal government allocate the amount of vaccines each state will receive, and local officials will use Tiberius to decide where every allocated dose will go  from local doctors offices to large medical centers, according to a press release. 

This means PLTR will likely rise the whole december with a few dips to buy.

PLTR 

Biden also appointed a former Palantir consultant as the new Director of National Intelligence. Look up Avril Haines.

Listen up tiny pps, EV is the future. Dont let a bald man growing veggies in his garden tell you its too high. Always invest in what you think the future is going to be and stick to it. Of course there would be some profit taking, its a healthy opportunity to load up
Rise up Tuscan warriors
First pullback day on CRSR after a 69 day boner rally
Ummm. I was told CIIC PLTR and CRSR only go up. Can someone poke premarket with a stick.
Dont blame us when TSLA moons right at open and you chose not to buy calls 
OPEN THE GATES

HELMETS ON

DONT GET HOOKED
You guys think youre retarded? Yall got nothing on yahoo finance comments
Oh yeah -5% premarket to green open on PLTR, completely normal
We desperately need a daily meme stock thread
Sold my entire CRSR position at open. Then bought back in after it dropped $4. Consider me Warren Buffett
pltr
PLTR 
I just bought 4k PLTR shares. I'm officially on the bandwagon. Let's do it
Autists: Wow I wish there was a CRSR dip so I could get in

*CRSR massive dip*

Autists: CRSR ded
PLTR -  Current Market cap - 44.13B. SNOW Mkt cap 78.99B . PLTR - Better product, better company, better contracts, better financials. This is a x2 bagger from here to Xmas.
How much GDP is lost because everyone is watching that PLTR chart tick by tick

If you aint day trading PLTR you aint black.
Why are boomers such fucking haters. My coworker been telling me I should sell PLTR. That it's a pump and dump and he has seen it a happen a million times.

I told him about it when it was around $11. And of course he says they never made a profit.
Is PLTR hitting $50 by the EOY?
Just picked up a call on that slut PLTR
PLTR made me more in 2 days then my bi weekly paycheck
Put 10k into PLTR at 13.54, Im feeling pretty good right now. Probably gonna touch my pp soon
PLTR DOWN 30 CENTS FROM ALL TIME HIGH THIS IS THE DIP
Pump PLTR boys!  Break $29 by EOD!
21K and climbing in 12 days thanks to PLTR. Amazing
The bloke who sold me Palantir 12.5c contracts before the hype  is gonna have a heart attack when I exercise the f*ck outta my contracts
my only regret with PLTR is not buying more leaps
HOLY FUCK PLTR GO GO GO
The pain of knowing pltr was going to be huge, waking up for IPO, seeing it fall concluding maybe I was wrong, and only buying a fraction of the shares I planned on buying... why does this always happen FUCKkkk
Hahahahahaha some fucking dickhead is downvoting PLTR posts

Eat a dick!!!
I sold my PLTR contracts two days ago for 3.9k they are now worth 11k. Hahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahabaababahhaabbaajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaj
Funny story. I tried to sell my 5 12/18 $30 contracts of PLTR yesterday for a nice little profit and bought rather than sold. I accidentally made a lot of money today.
Last night in the after hours, I threw $3,000 at pltr as a joke.
Last time PLTR in the 20s
People who buy PLTR puts: 
Hell yeah I won the race, somebody please belittle me now
Cue the day of stocks up 75% in a week dropping 13c and everyone calling for $rope
are we selling baba @open
Btfpltrd!!!!!!
I wanna jump on CRSR & PLTR again so much but I feel like a retard buying at ATH 
PLTR to the MOON
Dividend stocks baby!!
Im a fan of TSLA, but when will the company actually be worth its current market cap. I mean no matter how many cars they produce I dont think they can reach 500 billion market value. So its a matter of when there home battery and solar systems take off.  How long until they can actually have sales to back up a >$500billion dollar company?
Isn't this just the Friday dip but early because of Thanksgiving?
If HYLN doesnt have a 16% day, im going to have substantially less to be thankful for tomorrow
TSLA low key on the rise
Should I sell my PLTR 19c 12/18 at open and buy stocks?
Rug pull?
Someone please tell me to do with these baba 11/27 275c should I hold
GMEs premarket volume at 400 is pathetic yet some weak hands think were falling into the abyss
Big profit taking coming today pltr gang. Dont panic
Sell my $19 calls for PLTR that expire Friday?
Shall we begin pricing in those record NIO November deliveries (will be announced next week)?  Look forward to another blowout month with double production shifts and EC6 beginning its flex.

CRSR STOP THE COUNT
Gonna be down at least 10k at open unless Tesla shoots green. China fuckin ev bubble
CRSR looks like its opening in the deep red.  Its been a good rally but do I sell and run with my profit or hold?  35C DEC 13th 

Have room for the dip but want to keep as much as possible. First big hit run?

&#x200B;

SUGGESTIONS PLZ!
Excuse me WSB, Id like to return these PLTR calls?
I was at PLTR $20 calls. But since FDs give me anxiety I took some measly profits.
I seriously hope you guys arent paper handing plant tear
Remember, the more you lose in pre-market the more you'll recover on your hedges 
Li Auto is like the retarded Chinese EV brother. Recalls, shitty earnings reports, now getting investigated by the government. Just pull a Luckin already
HO-LEE-SHIT  
That Nio Dump. Obscene.  
I still think the stock is a good long term hold, so I aint selling.
if the markets are half what they are now in a year, you can guarantee the talking heads will all be chirping about how obvious it was that valuations were too high given reality. but for now its all steam ahead, only bulls, only going up or at worst, sideways
Im buying more BABA and PooLineTear today
Rotation out of Chinese EV into British EV 
CRSR lmao
Europe is taking all our meme money what in the hell. Time to bring them some peace and democracy?
Thanks whoever sold me $49 NIO puts, Ill take good care of your shares

Right when PLTR hit its day high yesterday around 11 or wherever I bought 22.5p 

Also picked up a NIO 52p in the AM. 

Never been a bear and refuse to identify as one still but daddy needs some money...
Hmmm, I think that Tesla will go to the right today, it might also go up and to the right or down and to the right
I sold my AMC calls and yolod on PLTR expiring after Turkey day. Yall think I should have stick to AMC? 
Shoulda known to get puts after ridiculous updays but i aimt no gey

Interesting. According to a form 4 dated 11/19, Stevie Cohen of Point72 sold 533k of hos 750k outstanding shares between 17-18$. He made is original fortune insider trading so perhaps his hedge fund has recruited an insider at Palantir and he knows something the public does not.
Tesla was at 569 a few hours ago and here we are at 545 now

PLTR shares are basically discounted calls.  Live this meme stock
Fuck me that took a while but BABA retard strength has finally been activated.
I feel like such a retard holding GME but Ill be damned this thing loves to keep going up
Is this the GME squeeze?
I'd get into BABA now before it  back to ATH in the next few weeks.
jesus, that DKNG $50 wall has been cucking it since last week
sigh...was debating between THICCB and NBAC a couple of days ago.  

Chose the meme...NBAC up almost 80% since then.
Everybody is selling CRSR to buy Corsair parts for Christmas, bullish af
Crsr going to rebound past 50 next week?
Saw CRSR was down pre market. Figured I'd buy the dip. Bought a couple minutes after open and lost a quick $400. Now I'm holding on for dear life... These are my favorite plays. 
Buy the nio dip before its to late
wtf is happening with CRSR
Bought a bunch of CRSR on this dip.
BABA BACK TO $280 MY DUDE
That you BABA?
My dec/jan GME calls have officially crossed the -40% mark 
I just wanna say, despite half the crowd going home in the 8th inning, NIO never gave up and I respect that.
Thank you bulls for letting us have just this one day. It felt so peaceful and relaxing 
BABA you are my 
LOL @ CORSAIR CORRECTION
*its a beautiful day in the thetahood*
CRSR RISING FROM THE ASHES LIKE A MOTHERFUCKING PHOENIX
Perfect day to buy w.e you want
Amzn actually has volume volume today.
I almost sold BABA at opening but some random guy said he was buying calls at open and it made me cancel my order and buy the BABA dip. Thank you random commenter
Imagine thinking EVs are done when its the next biggest industry innovation of our lifetimes and its just getting off the ground. Imagine thinking the aviation industry was at the top when the Wright brothers flew their plane for 7 seconds.
Bears really gone into hibernation in the last week huh
$4 gain in 40 mins? Okay, BABA. You keep your secrets.
Someone just bought 9.6M worth of Tesla calls
BABAAAA! PUUUUUUUUUUSHHHHHH!!!
Lets go BABA!! If HK would have just done their job wed be $290 already. $300 eow!!

BABA stuck at 280, gotta give it a little push
CRSR GOGOGOGO!!! GOOD FIGHT MAKE MY DICK HARD

do i just sell my 5 shares of Tesla bought at the split thats only made me $300 and dump it into PLTR?
.....and PLTR dipped 5 secs after I put in smh lol
I bought 2k shares of PLTR day one and planned to hold until I needed to buy a house, but if you retards can pump it to 50 eoy like you did with Nio I'm cashing out
methinks i should have gotten out of my 11/27 SPY puts an hour ago
Man guaranteed some WSBer finally fomo into all these meme stock yesterday (or Mon) and is now looking for rope.
GET ON APPLE WE GOING TO THE MOON
can we please ban the noobs from the chat shits annoying
stop expecting GME to pop, while it going up is great this is NOT the squeeze, will have to wait until at least next month for that.
Hope you retards didnt panic sold baba
DKNG is going to 70-80$ in jan
600 eod
These baba bags getting heavy

TSLA NEW ATH INCOMING 
Those who held thru TSLA dip have large cocks
Just hearing PSTH and Stripe in the same sentence is enough to send me to the hospital with an erection lasting more than four hours
i greatly enjoy cocaine
So this EV crusher was actually the usual NIO morning dip. 

NIOtists, resume operations.
Whoever paper handed tsla calls I cant even look at you, GO TO YOUR ROOM
CRSR i love you

Hopping on this crsr dip?
TSLA wants to touch 575...i can feel it

TSLA recall announced, stock moons, you cant make this shit up
TSLA on viagra
Corsair is free money run guys
im up 180% on the week, the best i've ever done... and I'm terrified lmao. this feels so inflated.
I lost $500 yesterday, bought PLTR calls this morning and made it all back. This trick works for everyone
BABA to $300 eoy
FCEL 
Lets reach 50 CRSR!

PLTR  RETESTED AND MOVINGGGG
The 3mil GME guy is up 100k today
Gonna buy a cheap OTM PLTR put just so that markets inverse me and keep pumping my 5/21 19/21 calls
Whats a realistic price target for PLTR? I was thinking 30 but we're almost there. Trying to get a feel for when to dump some of my leaps
WHATEVER PLTR RESISTANCE IS WE JUST GONNA GAP OVER IT. GET IN ON ANY DIPS
FOMO'd into CRSR after the dip and not buying when it was at 20-30 last week. Seems overvalued for the product, but with new research saying we're in an endless positive feedback loop with the automations, seemed like a good choice.
CRSR gang rise up!!!
Im gonna fomo into fubo
I WISH I HAD MORE TO PUT INTO PLTR. WHERE TO FIND A QUICK LOAN?
Bull SZN
Let pltr go to 27 you cucks
Nio gonna go green lol
SPCE is wildin out today
I hate SPCE. third time watching from the sideline
Corsair gains. In at $32 out at $51 and doubled my position at $45
CPP Just bought 24 million shares of Pltr. Get in
Dip buying chads rise up
LOL! Well I guess I will be losing my PLTR shares. I did covered calls when it was at 19 this week for $26 by 11/27. I thought (at the time), this stock has already had a fantastic runnup. There is no way it hits $26 by friday. LOL. Oh well. Still made good profit and good premium.
Buy the CRSR DIP

People freaking out over PLTR. Takes a look, it went down by 40 cents. 

Relax you tards
Imagine buying anything other than Palantir every again

PLTR is going to hit $30 by EOW isn't it?
PLTR never gonna go down!!!

I think xpeng vehicles are much better designed than nio or Tesla or Fisker
A Palantr is a dangerously good stonk, Saruman.

Why? Why should we fear to buy it?
$27!! We did it!!
This was great, bought more Cosair shares, bought back my calls for less than I sold and I'm gonna sell one of your idiot 70c's for $500 a pop next week
PLTR can consolidate AH. Then 30 Friday
PLTR buying CRM buying WORK?
Quit my job.  Early retirement pltr lets do the thing.
I tried to short pltr ama.
NIO just brushed off that 5 point damage premarket. All that for a drop of blood.
PLTR bulls who diamond handed shall be rewarded. We eating turkey and ham. Bears eating BYND soy turkey substitute.
I was close to breaking even, got out of CHWY at the top, into MSFT for the final push, and now Satya is personally giving it to me.

Everything is annoying me right now. Even my shirt. My shirt is so uncomfortable. reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
just bought pltr calls. Sorry guys too confirmed
PLTR wants to give a thanks before Thanksgiving.
My 29 PLTR calls for 11/27 I sold are in danger

PLTR is covering my NIO losses

Go up you chinese fuck
SQ MOON
Is PLTR a meme stock I should enjoy while Im in or is it an actual long term play
Sold PLTR 220% rolling into CRSR for another 200%???
I sold my FDs and now I'm trying to get back in. PLTR fomo is real.
NIO afraid of green today. F
PLTR 29 EOD. 31 EOW. 34 BY DEC 4. LETS GO
I bought some PLTR last week and its only gone up. Bought some more today see you guys on the moon!
This effin red in CRSR is making me so annoyed.
Cramer jerks off to us
 if youre not buying this dip get out of the thread
PLTR is giving you an opportunity
WORK puts dont say it was not told
BABA $300 EOD
Im over 25k now, this could be a sign of the top
PLTR looks like its established 27 as its new floor
You don't gotta go to $WORK, $WORK, $WORK, $WORK, $WORK, $WORK, $WORK
Apple why are you like this?
I bought Jan '22 PLTR calls at 35 in case it doubled over a year, a week ago.

It might be $350 by then
WORK better start constructing stairs up because I straight FOMOd at the top
Holy shit WORK

Whats the news?

I wanna fuck BABA in the ass
WORK call holders in lambos
BABA wtf

Money can be used to purchase goods and services
PLTR recharging.
They need to add strikes higher than 40 for Palantir
 How kind of pltr to give you guys another entry point
Fucking BABA. Rally up motherfucker
DONT SELL PLTR
Jumia just casually go up 20% evereyday?
IM NEVER GOING TO ALL-TIME RED EVER FUCKING AGAIN

SHITS DEPRESSING
Mirror, mirror on the wall, whos the most autistic of them all?
Pltr pump @3pm read it here first
The knights of PLTR are truly blessed with tendies 
WSB Daily Thread 12/04

REEEE WHY IS PLTR DOWN 40% I BOUGHT IT AT $32 YESTERDAY
Hold plntr
PLTR TO LEVELS WE HAVENT SEEN SINCE 5 MINS AGO
PLTR LET'S GO
Pltrrrr I love you 
thankful i didnt sell this FCEL calls yesterday. When in doubt always hold. (if experation is 1 month+ out)
Mac and cheese a Thanksgiving must-have?
Hold 20c pltr 1/21
Sell these 27c 11/27 PLTR calls or ride it till Friday?
If they could STOP SELLING tesla for 5 minutes we could all be millionaires for fucks sake!
crsr!
whats 3.5% more? not much. just do it
Is Apple considered a boomer stock? Asking for an old friend
Back on our SPCEship bois 
alright fuck it bought GME leaps and PLTR 32 12/18
What's your PLTR position?
these tsla option premiums are abs nuts
Overall the market has almost 70% more calls than puts outstanding. Im sure that bodes well for everything to keep pumping. MMs can afford it right?
Is PLTR 40c 12/31 at 2.23 a bad decision
PLTR 29 ish EOD.
If PLTR hits 40 by Christmas I vow to dump my RKT bags
Imagine when they give PLTR a P/T of like $75 And it goes to $125 immediately
This TSLA move is expected. Sometimes it seems like some of ya'll are forgetting how big a deal S&P 500 inclusion is. 30% of free float is about to get bought up, all these funds tracking the index will buy billions and billions in TSLA stock and NOT SELL.  


Do not sell TSLA prior to the inclusion going through. Doing so is is just giving away free money.
Alright what the fuck is MGNI and why arent I buying calls in it
PLTR is parabolic with no signs of stopping.
**EVERY  PLTR  DIP  IS  FREE  MONEY** 
SPY is gonna break out
Stock market too high imo
Idk why you guys FOMO. Theres literally a new meme stock every week
PLTR!!!!!!
Pltr
If youre not sure weather to get into PLTR or not, this is your sign
Exited my positions in WORK yesterday. Had 12/18 32.5c and 12/11 33.5c. Life is pain.
PLTR IS HAPPINESS
FSR is like the kid who gets bullied all throughout high school and then rolls up to the reunion in a Lamborghini with a playboy bunny girlfriend

# PLTR LARGEST VOLUME CANDLE OF THE DAY
YOOOOO 30 EOD STRAP IN
i fucking give up. anyone has SQ leaps?
CRSR still on sale -10%
well...i'm definitely getting assigned on my PLTR calls.
Someones gonna have to do a wellness check on Cramer. He might be dead after todays run up
Its not about the money.  Its about the memes we met along the way.
Going to build a time machine and go back three weeks to change my PLTR buy order from 300 shares to 3000 shares
This isn't even Fomo anymore
... The positive feedback loop is engaged
Im not sure what to make of PLTR so I sold some puts expiring this Fri at a nice premium. $5000 premium for a day and a half long contract and the chance to get some shares at a better price.. literally can't go tits up.
PLTR personally coming over at 1030pm when your circuit breaker tripped and helps you reset it so you can get back to playing on your new PS5
adding more PLTR on this dip
We mooning or what Elon?
People sleeping on MGNI

Bought 100 shares of PLTR @ 18 (yeah yeah, stfu)

Gonna sell at 28 for a 1k gain.

Realistically, how much higher can it go in the next few months?
Calendar debit spread on pltr let's go
Imagine buying Chinese EV at ATH, when you can buy FSR a non Chinese EV at ground floor.
For the record I hate you AAPL
SQUARE

Fuck, PLTR is giving me a light high.
Serious Question for you

I just broke 25k in my Robinhood Account but am all out of day trades

Anyone holding 11/27 Tesla calls

Options so quick to take not so quick to give
CRSR gonna jump

PLTR WTF ALREADY
dont stop daddy
lmao ive made 25k today off shares alone
$NIO go up you fucking cunt
PLTR IS GONNA MAKE ME CUM
Went from -98% all time, discovered PLTR and in 2 days im down 25% all time. This shit is fucking wild
PLTR ps5 plz

PLTR 31 EOD
PLTR to 50 EOY.
PLTR gonna dip again, then hit 30
Diamond handing TSLA 12/4 650c. Just got in. Am I golden or?
This fun
Jesus christ. I gave 2xed on calls bought this morning and 5xd yesterday
People laughed when we said $30 EOW. 

Never underestimate the power of this rocket!!!!!
Tesla is a monster
i wanna buy more pltr calls but i should wait right? This shit is gonna correct?

right?
BUY PLTR NOWWWW
All I want for Christmas is non gay aapl. Is that too much to ask for? For like 1 day
This is insanity.  Holy shit.
Hold pltr
Here comes the battle for $30! This is fucking exciting
I browse this thread for 2 min, switch back to think or swim and PLTR is up another $.50 cents wtffff
I will laugh at the retards who sell pltr at the end of the day
I sold at 27.20 with 94% return thinking i was a champ
HERE COMES 30 PLTR GANG - 32 EOD
Thiel has made $2 billion today (more than 17 countries annual GDP)
PS5's for everyone.
There's gonna be double digits of ps5's won by EOY
I have a serious question for call holders 2-3 months out. If you believe the price keeps going up do you just hold until close to expiry? When does theta decay become real and eat away at your gains?
Holy shit  
LAST CALL FOR PLTR BEFORE IT JUMPS AGAIN CKME OM GUYSSSS
PLTR making me cream my pants
where were you when PLTR hit $30
Make BABA great again!!
My 2325 shares of RKT are doing nothing but bleeding and PLTR is going nonstop parabolic
I am typically a pretty level headed guy but I may just purchase some cocaine and hookers after this run with PLTR. Put the finger in the butt type of activity
Ive never seen anything like PLTR with the exception of Tesla.
I have no idea why youd buy puts over just waiting and buying calls. Puts actually require you to be smart, theyre expensive and you basically gotta close them at the end of day if youre green. Something could be pumping 15% a day and calls 15% otm will still only be a few dimes. Probably why fuckers stopped buying puts its not worth it to sell anymore.
THIS IS THE DIP, GET IN!
Buy the dip
Buy the dip!!!
I personally am holding PLTR, but this still appears to be the dip. This thing is going to be 100 a share before we know it
I love that PLTR is mooning.



I hate that I wanted to make myself laugh and only bought 69 shares on that first day
Buy the fucking  dip
PLTR dip....
Lets go DIPPPP
Buy the dip or watch it explode
PLTR:  dreams do come true 
God I hope PLTR does that thing where it goes red one small red candle then slaps a green dildo on the table... we havent hit power hour yet
Everything rotation into TSLA and PLTR
This could be the best bet of an entry lmao
BOOMERS BE LIKE. SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL
SAY THE LINE WARREN BUFFET
PLTR diamond hands baby let's gooo $31 EOD

We should just execute all non-essential workers during the next lockdown. I mean, theyre not essential right? So why keep them around?
Short term exp PLTR bag holders will get cooked for thanksgiving
Got confused on Friday and bought INO instead of NIO like a professional
Just put in money I cant afford to lose into PLTR. Seems like a good idea.
Some "Analyst" at my local radio was saying TSLA to 1000 by the end of 2022. Lol what a fucking degenerate. He belong here with us.

I have a boomer friend I talk to about the market from time to time. Been trading since before the machines and they had to go thru the stock exchange n shit lol. He convinced me to open a position in metals, which Ive since lost 30% on lmao. Should I message him:

"The name of the company, Aerotyne International. It is a cutting edge high-tech firm out of the Midwest awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of radar detectors that have both huge military and civilian applications now."

Thats how a lot of you sound

# yet to be a PLTR dip that hasn't been bought
This has been my biggest week ever, Ive nearly doubled my account, AND ITS WEDNESDAY. Can we elect Biden every month?
**Cash gang be like:**

I told ya when PLTR IPOd it was a 1000% return stock
YALL ASKED FOR A DIP NOW BUY PLTRRRR
So PLTR 100 when lol
I SOLD PLTR FOR 100% GAIN WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY A 10BAGGER FUUUUUUUU
Yo, think about this; What always gets talked about at thanksgiving (other than politics)? Stocks. Which stock are people going to be talking about tomorrow? What are boomers going to rush into when their millennials grandkids tell them about being 100%+ up on. Thats right. Friday is going to be wild.
I cannot believe pltr is still skyrocking. How many double digit green days in a row will there be?
Here's the thing

I started investing last August after my mom died. Didn't really know what to do and bought retarded penny stocks. Found wsb and you autists and began reading, going through investing and realizing they're all scared boomers.

TL:DR I'm up 83.25% since finding this den of autism and I've never been happier
Bro PLTR is straight up financing my new flat
PLTR got some serious retard strength today holy shit
Pltr gain porn gonna be cray
at this point who hasn't bought pltr
Hold PLTR through thanksgiving?
PLTR 
PLTR DIPP BUY MIRE NOWWW

Pltr 50 by next week
SPY DOWN PLTR UP THAT'S THE WAY WE LIKE TO FUCK.
If any you bastards get greedy and try to profit take PLTR I will personally slice your balls off
I recall seeing bears celebrating PLTR being down 1-3% at premarket rofl
LAST CALL FRIENDS. GET PLTR < $30
Some downvoting douche bag is jelly that he didn't get into PLTR at <$20 
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to invest in Palatir. The product is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of coding and hacking most of the tech will go over a typical investors head. There's also societies nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into a dystopian high tech future- this philosophy draws heavily from Orwellian literature, for instance. The PLTR investor understands this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this company, to realize that they're not just a company- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike PLTR ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the inclination in PLTRs motto "We believe in augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it." which itself is a cryptic reference to Huxleys magnum opus Brave New World. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Alexander Karp's genius wit unfolds itself on their brokerage sites. What fools.. how I pity them.
Man I used to think electric vehicles were the future, an incredible technological revolution that would save the planet. The I woke up today and i realized, nah, fuck electric vehicles.
500$ on PLTR when market opens, I'm retarded
Imagine shorting PLTR, losing big and then going on a downvote spree.

You dont need to imagine, tard bears will do that.
Its never to late to FOMO PLTR
PLTR is tempting and terrifying. Jumping in on a +7% day seems dumb but missing the next +7% day seems dumber
where my thcbois at
Guys PLTR is not a meme stock. Amazing long term potential.
# 29.73 SELL WALL!!!!!!! FUCKING PUMP IT
DON'T YOU DARE SELL PLTR LIKE SOME SCARED OLD BOOMER
[removed]
If PLTR $50 EOD I will only post PLTR comments till end of year.
Cramer *really* wanted to just say "wall street bets," but he went with the Reddit....... Robinhood! 
Green by open 
Why the fuck did mango hold a 30 second announcement on DJ30k to tank the market WHYYYT
Captain Palantir about to turn doubters into motherfuckin trees.
PLTR 25 EOD EZ  gonna load up on more calls at open
Alright, long time lurking, finally succumbed to my inner autism and just went BALLS DEEP into PLTR 
Someone who is mad they lost a bunch of money is just down-voting every new comment. Sad boy.
If you dont own and didnt buy PLTR during that dip, I got a helmet to sell you
downvoter is a pltr bear.
What if Palantir used data on all of the worlds retards to determine the perfect time to IPO 
HOLY FUCK. The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) bought PLTR. NOT A MEME STOCK ANYMORE. BUY IT WHILE IT'S BELOW 50. NOT A FUCKING DRILL!
GO PLTR GOOO CHAT POWER
Greatest fucking week of trading ever
EV bulls..not a great time to buy the dip. Market closed for tomorrow and we are probably going to sell all day
Im fuckin done with Chinese companies
Sold all my Li, KNDI, CIIC totaling 30k yesterday. The only time Ive ever got out before holding the bags.
y'all act like you never seen a red day before
When all the retards fell for a pump&dump and people start to sell: " Whats happening ????"
Sir, theyre not buying the dip.
So yolo ing into PLTR yesterday was not a good decision?
dow 30k didnt last long lmao
All these self congratulatory threads about how WSB is some really important social movement rather than some typical boiler room style pump and dump scheme...... makes me really realize how truly sad and pathetic all of our lives here truly are.  Puts on our self esteem.
CRSR Gang, Hold the line. Got plenty of time for Dec expiries and later for recovery. Atleast were not in some shittt chinese ev pump n dump  

Holding my 55c 1/15/21 CRSR with

I like how everyone knows meeting for T-giving is going to be disastrous but people be like "I gotta eat this dry ass turkey and listen to my dad bitch about muslims...what can I do?"
Daily reminder..... its ok to dump your RKT shares at a loss. Youll feel better this Thanksgivings
[deleted]
Futures flat again means we rise all day.
All these EV companies are gonna go vertical at open and recover 50-75% of overnight losses. Then theyll drill to the earths core. Calls into puts boys.

Tuscan cocksucker

Im gonna go to their enclave and slaughter them like Anakin did to the younglings
Pltr green by noon. Stop pumping it pre market. I still need to buy my calls at open
If you have shares, long calls, and not FD's **DO NOT FUCKING SELL**. 

Don't screw yourself outta long term gains just because you see a tiny bit of red.
BABA climbing back in PM. Probably won't open green but better than shedding all of yesterdays gains.

Everyone complaining about the dip, when my portfolio already started tanking yesterday.

Oh shit papa we are getting fucked
Got 10k of Friday Tesla puts last night. Pray for me. Forgot the fucking market was closed on Thursday and a god damn half day on Friday
basically everything that was green yesterday is red and red ones from yesterday are now green just to make sure everyone gets a turn
I tried pretty hard to stay out of the market this week... then I yolod it all in Tesla weeklies lol.
Vix is still low as fuck
Meme-mageddon aside, if you read through these comments you would never guess futures basically flat
China auditing evergrande auto should be really good news for the actual legit EV makers.
Market looking spooky right now like the Undertaker 

Bears like 
Tsla big doomp
*Looks at Nio 60C May 2021s bought a while ago, looks at pre market*... Am I supposed to be phased by this?
Damn Tesla taking the nasdaq down
12/18 285 BABa calls, have been bag holding from down 40% to down 10%. Should I just sell?
When will XPEV bottom? Im scared
LGVW holding strong
Just $100 more TSLA and I'll be rolling
Why is nio sad?
Remember tards: 

In.Out.Git.Grab.Bonk. 
Protect ya god damn neck. Aight?
EV giveths and takeths
Lesson learnt the hard way - the casino always wins 
I just had a thought  Had been thinking that TSLA would be safe up until S&P inclusion - but with all these index tracking funds now needing to buy it - why wouldnt they torpedo the price?
Anyone else jumping into SBE?
[deleted]
EV puts bought yesterday was so juicy....
MMs know the economic data is bad, GTFO quick!
Kinda funny this sub looks down on buying shares when share buying mostly determines your profitability.
That is one big pile of dip
Anyone wanna go on a feels trip this morning, watch this [Chinese folded man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ycLWc4bRtg).

Glad it worked out for him. We take our mobility for granted. I'm grateful to have so few real world problems that I can gamble.
What did I miss? Why is everyone shitting their pants?
Dollar sinking, Nasdaq pumping
ICLN and BABA
FB going to rip today... I hope. Bought 100 FB 11/27 300c at 0.01 a piece yesterday
Thanks for buying my naked calls yesterday. Gonna close them at open and buy more shares at a discount. Maybe sell naked tsla puts
Hopefully the huge dip on tesla gets eaten up and we go back to green by lunchtime
Jobs down spending up lmao everyone blowing that stonk money

Yuh Im gonna buy that fucking dip
Hair of the dog checking in.
Xi drives a nio
Hope vale keeps up the good work
Ive written $70 NIO calls and $40 NIO calls for Jan 15 over the last couple of days. At first, I was worried about my short calls being pressured, but now it looks like my short puts are going to start sweating.
only a retard can make retarded gains 
Loading up on palantir shares ; iv for calls is way too high right now
tfw cant trade pre market FUCK t212
whats the play today? Im thinking SQ
I wonder how much of the selling in TSLA are short sellers?  Its always more fun watching TSLA go up when at least half are bears panic buying to cover.
Should I que my ev calls to sell immediately or wait to see what happens?
My nio is fuk but my ZM and pton might save the day
Green day, into a green/flat day, into a flat/red day. Mostly expected for a short week.
BABA climbing out.
These boomer stocks are gonna be the death of me. Ive been doing this for whole months now and still cant afford a Ferrari. Fuck it were going all in on the next unprofitable Chinese EV that goes green.
Hahaha you fools didnt know that LUMN is the only real meme stock?? 
I would love for the DOW to open below 30k, and then when it gets above 30k again to have mango come out for another 45 second presser to point it out again.

You know that's a real possibility -- his twitter history confirms it. He's always about hyping the milestones every time they hit even if it's a repeat.
I think CIIC might be dead
Buy the thicc b dip
SPCE or PLTR? Leaps or Shares?

Were are at the blue arrow level.

The fact that 50% of the people holding NIO will get wiped out if the stock  lose 10% while being up 3000% in weeks is minboggling.
Will nio comebackkk
TCBY is gonna rip in the next two weeks.
And it'll be hilarious when it does.

Yogurt for everyone except mods and naysayers and people who know know how a spac merger works.
Should I sell my PLTR 11/27 25c 27c and 28c and buy later date ones?

Looks like Corsair and palantir are having a sale this morning
Remember, one of the main characteristics of a bull market is stocks open lower and climb higher throughout the day. Where as in a bear market stocks open high and sell off all day.

PLTR bears absolutely in shambles right now

Someone has a fat wall at $26 on PLTR.
Cutter : I once told you about a sailor who bought China EV calls.

Robert Angier : Yes, he said it was like going home.

Cutter : I lied. He said it was agony.
Trying to make trades in the morning on vanguard is like trying to snipe bids on eBay back in 2001 on dial up
Crap way to lead into Thanksgiving

Fear and greed index at "extreme greed" FYI. Took my profits and cahs gang baby
Excuse me Elon wrong way
Sell CRSR and buy the dip?

The CRSR shares in my portfolio looking over at my PLTR shares saying I should take profits.
Nothing like a nice -16% red day to wipe out all my gains
my portfolio hasn't been this low since 3pm yesterday
Good time to get into CRSR?
I'm a total pleb and am wondering. Is this PLTR growth just a retard pump that will dump. Or are there actual non autist finance-humans believing in this company and buying for this price?
bears are up so who is downvoting because bulls cant downvote as it signifies a loss
Thoughts on FCEL and PLUG should I buy at the dip or fuck those stocks
Aapl and amazon carrying this bullshit
If Tesla goes back to 520 load the fuck up
I've never seen so many toilet paper hands in one stock like I do in PLTR

bUy tHe DiP
JMIA will not stop fucking pumping. Ive been telling yall... to the moooooon
My only reason for not selling NIO for the past two weeks has been that I don't know where else to put the money
Amazon about to squeeze higher, get in
Kodak lmaooooo
Analysts are such unbelievably manipulative shitheads. Morgan stanley saw nothing wrong with Fords EV plan until they it rallied 5% (and presumably MS had accumulated a nice short position).
the beautiful V is happing at this moment.  another ATH today probably
Big dick energy happening
tsla about to do that moon thing again
Market set on easy mode.
I'm eyeing some TSLA weeklies. 600 end of next week should be easy, right?
Apparently the Canadians take their pensions seriously. PLTR 35 by Christmas.
Why in the fuck did the spac for microvast get put on autoban list. So much for making people aware of it
Its time for PLTR 100c ???
FSR clear Signal, Jump in NOW. Citigroup just release 26$ price target.

Enough volume. It will try to retest HOD today.
Safe to sell PLTR $30 11/27 CCs?
Hot damn, the CEO of LLBean on CNBC looks like a complete tool.
What lotto ticket can I get with my remaining $64 buying power
Do you think the big firms are doing sentiment analysis on us?
Raging bull market for the next 3 years at least
DD:  


If TSLA moons, and people arent cashing out EOD theres a BIG buying opportunity  here. Retards talking to family about crazy gains may give the market yet another FOMO push for meme stocks on Friday overall.
What happened to CRSR boys?????????
Apple calls at 112 earlier this week was free money
PSTH traders are loving the Stripe news I guess
Sleeping on FCEL 
This is what's been driving the market higher.  RH is issuing bonus contracts.

NIO is about to turn green soon!!!!
....andddddd Im Green
After making sick gains on PLTR this week, I went on a mission to find a 6-12 month call play to roll some of the profits into. I thought, who's gonna do well in a Biden administration? China. What're people going to do when COVID fears go away? Fuck. What's a company I know in the Chinese fucking industry that I have traded successfully in the past? MOMO. What's a good strike price/date? July 15C.
Sometimes i pee sittingdown to take extra time in the bathroom at work so i cn stare at my tickers a little longer

*just boomer cuck things*
PLTR just hit 26 already ffs
Ive gotta shit ton of weed, a brand new 80 inch 4K, and double XP on Cold War with no roommates, family , or work to bother me until next week.  if only I had made more tendies this week.

Saving is the goal right now. Investing would be like the cherry on top. Many young investors, wary of bear markets, have focused on paying off debt and saving instead of investing in the stock market

Where do these guys put their savings if not RH?
Can't stop won't stop PLTR stop
Whats the move with CRSR??

NEVER DOUBT CATHY WOOD
If we stay relatively flat today, Friday is going to be a pump for the ages
Is PLTR the 1x in a lifetime stock that MMs are letting plebes along for the ride? I can think of no other plausible explanation...

Peter Thiel similarly pumped Tilray to ungodly highs before letting it crash but this isnt ganja
Crazy stat: 22% of all dollars in circulation were created in 6 months in 2020.
I want to see Cramer react to Palantir retardation lmaoooo
All of my "aggressive" plays became wildly conservative, locking in like 40% gains on the week.

I don't even know any more people. Is the Greed index over 100 yet?

# Imagine not buying that 30 cent dip.
So... maybe PLTR should take a break?

The 11/27 $32cs I sold earlier are looking a bit suspect right now. 

Just a little break. Let theta do its magic tomorrow and resume a smaller moon trip on Friday.
Is the ps5 contest going up today?

Never buying puts again. This only goes up.
JMIA 40 EOD 55 EOW
All you PLTR boys&girls missing out on INAQ which has 30% gain
Does anyone else think its fucking stupid how you show half your friends how much you actually make and they kind of just ask you like a thousand times a week on how to invest. Then they literally keep saying ah im waiting for the right moment or ah i dont wanna risk this 2 grand

Just do it you fucking pussy. Im tired of telling ur ass what to do a hundred times, and you just not doing it anyways. You gotta be ultra retardedly fucking stupid to not make any money during this quarantine. On top of that, making 6x what you are making at your current job through Robinhood by just pressing literally three buttons.

PLTR & TSLA  
Who would know a bunch of fellow autists could gain control over trillion dollar stock market
DW PLTR IS JUST TYING HER HAIR UP

So is this just a thing now that random stocks are essentially going to turn into b-coin and get  FOMOd off the charts?

Think CRSR will go up tomorrow?
PLTR calls to replace Gold as a store of value

Peter thiel you beautiful kinda autistic bastard!!!
11k into PLTR options right now. Just checked its market cap, its at $50B... I assumed at these low stock prices, it had to be a few billion at most. Is this market cap, appropriate for a company with no profit?

Lol
Fuck you alibaba. Youve been a piece of shit all day
This sub is a cross between Mad Max Fury Road and that scene in The Big Short when Steve Carrells character is interviewing the loan closers. I love it.

Edit: to be clear about Mad Max reference - Im referring to the crazy guys who huff and commit suicidal actions hoping to get to Valhalla.
**THAT MOTHER FUCKER TOMMY WAS RIGHT FOR ONCE!**

#fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck

https://streamable.com/0lqfmm
Never would have thought yesterday that my PLTR 12/4 28 call would almost be in the money today. 
When ordinary car makers issue massive recall-shitty companies, what a scam, lets short the stock to the ground

When TSLA issues recall-Wow, this proves Tesla is a responsible corporation, and car owners are in Elons good hands. Buy buy buy buy buy!
Up 17k on the week and its only Wed

SPY DOWN PLTR UP
I'm actually really sad. I made a meme making fun of FD's, and it caused people to buy what was considered retarded 11/27 $30 PLTR calls for $10 a share. It's now $168 a share. 

I didn't buy any calls. 

The real retard was me all along.
This retard sold his PLTR 11/27 25 calls for .10 each at a 50% loss on Monday. Fuckkk
PLTR TO 100
palantir and tesla on a race to mars
Never forget that there were people on here who said to not FOMO into PLTR and that it's a <$20 stock
I had 10 fsr calls exp 11/27 at .63 .. 

I sold them for a tiny 100$ profit knowing what could happen.. 

I would have stood to make 3k from those calls if i held till today

And that is the reason why i am poor
31 EOD
BUY PLTR NOWWWWITS DIPPING AGAIN
The real question. How many of you fuckers have the balls to hold PLTR through thanksgiving. Remember, markets closed tomorrow.
Tesla is at $2850 pre-split !!!
With PLTR I'm guessing all of WSB is basking in an pool of tendies except me who sold all my calls yesterday for a measly 1 bagger?
Im going to invest on any company Thiel invests in.

Hope you all are fucking enjoying your cashgiving day with tendies.
People are talking about "buying the dip" but calls are so overpriced with high IV that the dip barely affected the price of calls. Just get shares and save yourself the stress. Sell at 50.
PLTR said "you think i'm dropping? JUST KIDDING"
No chance PLTR is done
Finally some sellers on PLTR. If this get bought up again we're going to $40 next week.

NIO is just doing that thing where big boy shareowners pretend to dump in premarket to shake the price down and pick up more on a discount. Don't be fooled, don't be a pussy. just hold the line

These Citron dudes are real fucking losers.
Proud NIOtist here, and I aint budging today

Knights of PLTR hold the line and stop fucking selling 
Yummy NIO sale today mmm
We need a stimmy pump ASAP. Save us Ol Yeller
I feel like BABA is just moving with the market. I still think it's a solid buy. Especially today with Xi and Biden planning a play date.
Be careful buying weeklies today. Today is the last trading day before a half day Friday
Highly recommend cashing out some gains to buy yourself something this holiday season. I just bought a 4K Vizio TV with PLTR gains
One red day and this sub turning to a . Im disappointed in yall retards
If Tesla dropped like the titanic to $344 theyd still be up 400% on the year.

Thats how decoupled from reality they are.
Lmao so glad iam with pltr, every other meme stock down lol
What are these?  EV dips for ants?
NIO is dipping because of "Chinese regulatory worries". Then I saw Tesla. GM. Ford. and then all the other vehicle stops. Nah. it's not "regulatory worries" it's hedge funds/big money taking profits. This will fly back up. Buy the f'ing dip!  
edit: do your dd--it may slump even more at open before recovering.
Yall bear bitches scared the shit outta me. We going green at open. My PLTR and AMC calls gonna make money today

Don't like to be a  , but when (1) a stock rises an insane amount over a couple weeks and then pumps up like crazy in a single day and (2) everyone on this thread is talking about it, that stock is probably going to have a pullback soon. 

References: PRPL (***), SLV, IAU, etc

#COILED SPRING
Tuscan dropping. Why cant it hold gains?
Feeling cute, shorted 50 shares of XPEV in pre market. This Chinese investigation news will spook people for a bit. Thats what you get for betraying Elong.
Lmao stand ur ground nio investors
NIO stand back and stand by
*two* no name Chinese EV companies are being investigated, you illiterate retards.
LGVW the only SPAC not dumping?

TSLA fighting for its life to not fall below 550 lol. musk must personally be buyin every dip premkt
Did China pull a citron on the Chinese EV sector?  Damn assholes
Cramer tweet trying to scare the RH crowd into selling Chinese EV. BTFD. You know how right he was about tesla a year ago.
Predictions for NIO?
you idiots understand that the EV run hasn't even started? Once Biden has been sworn in, all EVs are going x100500
Kinda hoping for a flash crash. I want cheap longs. Plus the shit show would be hilarious
Took PLTR and TSLA profits yesterday. Cash gang today and glad, todays vibe is weird
Buy American, shift bask to $FSR  

Lets make Fisker the biggest EV company in the world for no reason
Hmm what do I get one sale today? Pltr or crsr. Leaning towards crsr
NIO is gonna screw me!!!!
Quit bitching and buy the dip(s)
This EV investigation is going to turn into a giant nothing burger. China isnt going to fuck up their own companies, this is all for optics. Might not be a bad idea to buy the dip on some of these...
Here is the dip everyone keeps asking for, don't miss it.
all of you guys are gay
Just a reminder of next week's earnings:

ZM, KR, ULTA, CRM, DOCU, DG, SPLK, SNOW, CRWD

And many others

I know none of those are pltr or EV or penny spacs. Just get your head out of your ass for a second.
Can we start memeing draftkings again
What time today will PLTR hit 50?
Today is going to be green as the Grinch's cock by closing bell
NIO  NO DIPS FOR ANYONE

bye weak handers
Unemployment trending back up means more stimulus and more QE for longer. In JPow's market double dip recessions are bullish, boys. Bullish as fuck.
I dont own travel or vaccine stocks... before I get retarded replies to this statement 

I like how CNBC is posting some vaccine FUD like people wont get the follow up vaccine shot because the first sucks! Yeah dude. Weve all been vaccinated (unless our parents were mega retards). It does suck. But then its ok in a day and you dont get the fucking flu or in this case... the vid.
Buy the dip faggits
IM NOT FUCKING LEAVING!!!!
When can I come into PLTR today? @ the open?
CRSR down in pre-market? Impossible.
So PLTR is just never going to dip again so I can load up on more? Im ok with this.
We only got four minutes to save the world!!!
NIO 52c is easy brain dead money
PLTR IS SO STRONG
The battle for PLTR today will be epic
PLTR is going 
There will be no PLTR dip
Lol pltr 25 get fuk 
PLTR is a fucking beast!
PLTR MADE MY PORTFOLIO DO A V SHAPED RECOVERY

PLTR: Boomers hate this one simple trick millennials are using to get rich fast!

Half the autists on here don't know who Maradona is
PLTR 30 EOD???
2008 crash took about 6 years to recover from its lows 2020 only took 6 months then proceeded to go up another 8% the following 3 months 
Dont forget to take profits

Well shit shoulda bought more PLTR instead of CRSR.
Finally PLTR liftoff

There is still some time left to get on board.
Lol at mods banning THC-B, even they wont stop this train once it starts
Those waiting for the dip to buy pltr. Just buy it now because when its at 100 that 10 cent drop you are waiting for wont matter.
PLTR 30 EOW
PLTR
I know we are all focused on PLTR right now but the water on my dashboard is doing the ripple thing from Jurassic Park and I shit you not, I never would've believed it, it's that fucking SOLO car driving up next to me, don't ask me for DD, I'm too lazy to make graphs
Well I did MGNI and PLTR this morning and I'm up 150% on MGNI
Way too much talk of taking PLTR profits in here.
# WHEN SHE KEEPS SWALLOWING
SO GLAD I HOPPED OFF THIC BBY TRAIN FOR THESE SWEET PLTR GAINS
MGNI the next ticker to get rich!
Some of you fucking retards are going to get absolutely demolished if PLTR has a 5% correction.
Just a quick reminder that I bought a TSLA call 505 for $300 and sold it for $400 and right now its worth 6k 
Boy when they pull the rug on pltr we are all broke
PLTR 31 EOD
at this rate PLTR is going to reach 40 by next week
#THIS FUCKEN PLTR DOPAMINE
you guys think PLTR will ever stop? Might be a trillion dollar company before year end.
God I am so fucking glad i left /r/financialindependence. I have made more from PLTR and NIO the past month then I do from my big tech SWE job for 1/2 the year
I sold PLTR at 19 for a 10% gain on my 20c. I feel so much pain rn
Be fearful when others are greedy
You gotta be lightning quick in this market. When PLTR dips if you arent buying it then it'll be ATH before you can blink twice.
Just bought another 400 shares PLTR. Don't f me on this one.
Just bought $30c PLTR expiring in 2 days fuck it
I still remember  the day I got in on PLTR the day it was listed. One retard said it's meh when I asked him if it's a good company. Inverse wsb worked wonders
I've made a two week paycheck in the last 3 days
I have suggestion for Robbinhood app developers, can one of you pls pass on:

Remove all other tickers, just have one button says BUY PLTR. Also remove sell button.

Thanks for listening to my zoom seminar.
Cant wait til they announce vaccine tracing from palantir. we prob lookin at $35
My account is a sea of green
Oh my god 30 eod is actually happening lmao
PLTR below 30 is an absolute steal. Just wait till it hits 40 at the end of next week. Never too late to YOLO.
Guys, Im really scared. Ive never had 4 Green Days in a row 
PLTR has to be pricing in some big news right? This massive jump seems unprecedented but wtf do I know I've only been trading since april
Imagine saying PLTR 30 by Wednesday when it struggled to brake the 16 barrier last Friday
PLTR daily discussion thread
this thing really gonna hit 30 before EOD. congrats to everyone.
# PLTR SELL WALL AT 29.72 LETS RUN THIS BITCH OVER

Fuck me am I actually thinking of exercising a call for the first time? PLTR 20c those shares looking juicy

Why is CNBC reporting about food banks when were ATH and all become millionaires here. Way to kill the mood. But in all seriousness though, donate to your local food banks if you can, I took some of my gains and bought some stuff to donate.
PLTR GANG EVERYBODY LFG
Will PLTRs % gain eclipse the stock price itself?  This generational market event shall be dubbed **the autistic cross**
fuckin pltr u go!!!
Remember when TSLA premiums got stupid expensive and everyone was like, Ill wait until these get cheaper but they never got cheaper? Thats PLTR right now
Whoever times puts on the PLTR correction is gonna make bank.
Seems like American stock markets overreact to any news out of China - two unheard of EV companies get investigated and China mentions regulating the sector and everything dumps. lol calm down y'all. China's government has the power (and ambition) to promote a much bigger green energy revolution than we're likely to see in the US in the next 5-10 years.
Pltr gang, stay the fucking course.

If I told you Monday we would go up 25% this week youd offer your mouth to your wifes boyfriend Cock.

Chill out and eat a tiny red dick for a day
Do we call this a healthy pull back day?
My niogros we have seen this exact same movement before. Do not paper hand, recovery is imminent
Yo retards china government is investigating EV companies. This isnt the dip yet

Would love for my SPY puts to print, just like a little bit.

LGVWWWWWWWWWW 
CRSR BABY 
Ive thought about it. Ima take profits and reassess where to enter in a few hours. Maybe buy back into the dip on some Stonks with the large cut of remaining profit. Doesnt seem worth risking, if I called it wrong I only loose a small cut of profit, but if I hold most of it evaporates
Oh hey... my CCL puts may not be so fucked after all
My anus is bleeding
people are aggressively bearish for essentially the flattest of futures. not crawling out of my bear den until we see some real -2% blood which will never happen again

Edit: so far I haven't let the day of the week affect when I buy. I know it might be an absolutely ridiculous question, but ya never know until you ask.

If you are not deep in money into spce then you are chasing past with pltr and nio since they already rose and future is unknown. So your best bet is to bet on innovation in spce...
If i had money i would buy NIO dip today but only got 200 in checking account now til Friday.
I sold 1/3 of my PLTR position so I make money even if it expires below the strike. Free rollin the rest of this to 12/18

Sold my tesla calls at the top and was actually able to buy them again for about 2-3k less. Already up a grand
If I had bought options instead of pltr shares 3 weeks ago I would be a millionaire
CNBC scrubs talk like PLTR is a shit company or that they just dont even know what it does. I cant tell if were the autists or they are
Thank you for putting me on pltr! Free money!

Rotation2tech.mov ztarts playing

Rinse and repeat boys. Every damn time lol. Also, I'M COOMING PLTR
TSLA just pulling a U-turn, will join PLTR in gains shortly
First time trading options on Margin.

When I have to declare bankruptcy, I shall blame you all.
If FIsker holds above 18.50 Friday then theres a good chunk of profit, but a bitter sweet exit of something I wanted to ride long selling calls on. Will be good to rotate into one of these cracked out stocks tho heavier instead of just small positions. 
I love you all  
So ummm, like buy the TSLA dip, right? It's been free money for 2 weeks.

Mother fucker..wrong way baba bitch ass

Mommy is BABA gonna go green today?
CRSR whatcha doing my dog? Can you be comfortable back at 50
So Amzn going straight up and the s&p staying relatively flat/down should probably be a warning sign. Im throwing in some more hedges
Baba what u doin bb
50/50 Apple and PLTR stock portfolio who said I am not diversified?
Maybe I'll learn my lesson on AMZN this time if it goes back to 3500.  Probably won't learn, though.
Im wondering when I should sell off my PLTR 28c 12/31 calls, got in pretty cheap and Im over 100% but I wonder if I can ride it all the way to 200%
Left about 50% on the table with PLTR, left with 109%. Cant be too mad I guess.

I have made 2.5 weeks pay since Thursday solely because of TSLA. Would've been triple that had I not took profits early, but I'm very happy with what I've got. Thank u Elon
Tesla about to blow up !
Well amazon woke up that's nice
Half my portfolio is in crsr dip. Is this the diversification I learned about in college?
Boeing can't design airplanes but they sure know how to run up their stock using buybacks. But I guess their buyback department is taking rest of the week off. They deserve it. They love 'murca.
Elon: Saddle up motherfuckers.
Welcome back CIIC, knew youd do it
Papa Musk awake
TSLA about to go green

TSLA does not have anything less than 7% green days
I'm no crayon expert but NIO really looks like it's due for a giant green dildo
RIOT boys
So when companies realize they can save an actual shit ton of money by having most employees work from home, we will begin to see some epic collapses. Public transportation will take a huge hit, business that rely on business workers being in offices in the city, commercial real estate, housing in many city centers, all of these will begin collapsing. 

We are talking many public companies losing 30-40% of their sales (*looking at you starbucks*) as people don't feel assed to go out of their homes and drive to a starbucks that's 5-10 minutes away.

I just don't see how this ends well for a lot of sectors unless the governments gives huge tax incentives to bring people back into the office, but are we already past that point? Companies have already received so many tax breaks and bailout money that the government won't have much else to offer. It's scary times ahead
DKNG 
TSLAAAAAAAA
Wtf was that green candle on CHGG? Whats the news?
market: oh man all these meme stocks are dying what can we buy?

Lmao remember when we thought 25 EOW was too ambitious for PLTR? Fuck me dude. 30 EOW is a possibility at this point
AMZN 3230 thats all I ask.  Been bag holding this shit for way to long I just want to break even 
Does SPY want to go up or down. What you want to do dear
Anyone else buying APHA simply on the speculation alone that it will become a meme stock?
NIO's march to 100 continues
Damn if only I held all these Tesla weeklies through the storm. Was able to get out with profit early tho
If DOW breaks 30k again today the full euphoria will return

Lunch dip. Go jerk off then cum back.

Man, remember when TSLA and SPCE mooned beyond comprehension before the first Market Crash in Feb?
I'm not in SPCE but I love seeing it return to it's old glory. Like a proud Father watching his Son leave the nest

AAPL hits 118 eow
Already up bigly on NIO calls I bought this morning

By greatest regret today is not buying pltr during that dip earlier
damn someone loaded the fuck up on slack calls an hour ago.. now i see why
I feel bad for people who want to buy the dip on PLTR, the most its going to dip is a few cents. We have retard strength latching onto this thing while its on a 1 way trip to the moon 
I'm kind of glad the market is closed tomorrow. My 11/27 28c PLTR Covered calls may still have a chance.
Rest in Peace Maradona... :(
RIP Maradona. Fuck 2020
Im losing tendies by making wrong moves. Time to step away for a day
Slack halted up instantly on that news
I find it hilarious that the big short PLTR meme from last week said it would buy 5k worth of PLTR 30C 11/27 and those calls are prob up like 3X - 4X.
Pro tip: sell weekly calls or puts on whatever you believe. We have a vacation weekend/half day coming up. Reap the 4 day theta decay.
If only I had held my already +134% PLTR 12/18 $25c that I sold yesterday....wtf if going on with this company? The biggest of big dick energy....I guess since kramer mentioned it boomers are starting to pour in? fuck me running

Holy fuck PLTR leaps are printing
LOL WHAT THE FUCK PALANTIR
My covered call I sold 3 days ago thinking "There is no way this can go tits up":

PLTR 11/27 26c - When PLTR was 19 already up big in the last week

JMIA 12/18 40c - When JMIA was 26.75 already up 40+% in the last week

CRSR 12/18 55c - When CRSR was 42 already up 35%+ in the last week

&#x200B;

Fields of green!! Nothing but green everywhere I look! I love you America! Happy thanksgiving and I hope you crazy fuckers have a great holiday! Let the money rain down on you all! 
PLTR 11/21c $15
Since trying to get in WORK after the first ten minutes is basically playing knife games with your dick and balls, does anyone have a theory on what CRM might pivot to if they don't like the price for slack? That seems like the real play, buy 500 fds at .02 or .03 each on some boring collaboration ticker and watch it gap up 5 years worth of growth into the money in one second.
Sold calls and bought $500 in PLTR FD puts just cuz
Like five tops and two bottoms today on spy
Whats the play?
I just need spy to drop .5% is that to much to ask

TSLA 700 EOY is guaranteed. You think this runup is crazy, wait until the funds buy 30% of free float on actual inclusion.
My dick can only take so much stroking!!!!!
When are we rotating into GME?

I feel like this is the sign that the tech overlords have taken over, either that or a bunch of retards in a subreddit memed the fuck out of tech
[deleted]
Anybody playing FSR?
I like to think that buying 2 calls 80 and 100% OTM is a bull call spread.
Fuck work what a stupid fucking stock
My FSR 22.5c 5/21 exp looking fucking juicy
Yall still not back on CODX with the new ABC test?
I have got to stop selling covered calls on meme stocks. 
I wish I FOMOD more than 10k of PLTR on Monday. Sold half yesterday. Bought back another 7k in today. This is insane. Predictions end of next week? Will we ever get a red day?
Got 2 PLTR 20$ Jan 2022 calls, bought at 5.00. What can I do to make money out of them?
WE SEC NOW BOIS
anyone doing pltr $40 calls?
Anyone buying PLUG dip??
Im officially on the PSTH . I just feel like the silver fox will win. 

Current positions: 20 $30 calls for March (paid $2.17 per contract at the time). Good  return (30%) so far. 

Just added nearly 1000 shares too. Curious what everyone else is doing with this one?
omg
Shit at this rate I'm going to have to hold my calls past year end so I don't get hit with a huge tax bill next year
Fuck waiting for Friday to go into any big positions
time to break out the PLTR 30 hats!
Damn I sold my PLTR 27c a bit early it seems.
Lmao. It just won't stop!

BuyCRSRdip
Palantir, I know you're listening. Play Queen- Don't stop me now.
Are spac tickers banned in here? I got a comment removed for using one from a recently popular dd
Damn wish I bought more pltr.. Im kinda scared to now
Once the GME squeeze happens we'll stop talking about pltr but in the meantime....PLTR TO THE MOON!!! 
JMIA & PLTR 
"Welcome to the Roaring 20s" - Mango for some reason at the end of a tweet about "losers and suckers" in the military
Dont want to pull out to early like a little B.. dont want to stay in too long and miss out on gains made already.. the duality of man
MGNI 
If you guys had Tesla weeklies that were currently up 15% would you sell now or do you think theyll be a post lunch rip sesh?
Cant believe I sold my JMIA calls hours ago. Thought for sure the pump was down after +4 dollars apparently I was wrong
HOLD PLTR AND BUY MOREEEE
Let's GOOOOO sold my deep ITM PLTR calls to roll them into $30 strike, wasn't sure if I should wait for a dip but said fuck it and rolled them instanty
[Serious] whats going to happen when the moratorium on evictions gets lifted in January?
Fuck it buying a few PLTR 25p for Friday... I still have long dated calls but might as well hedge or whatever its called
If alibaba goes in the green today Id probably be at breakeven all time

The market serving money for Thanksgiving.
If my calls were bought OTM but now are ITM. Do I have to sell before expiry date? Or I can keep the gains going and it will never expire. Retard with over 400% gains in 5 PLTR calls asking
God I should've just fucking double downed at $27 like I wanted
I have no words. p

Finally hopped on the PLTR bandwagon...up 360% on my OTM calls expiring this week.  Now I understand the circle jerk behind this ticker
>Slack shares surge on news that it will no longer exist.

Reuters

LET meeeee SAY it FOR EVERYONE PLTR buy it whenever and YOU WILL PROFIT
Sold everything this morning and got gold. Maxed out margin and put it all in PLTR. My only regret is not buying options
MGNI sounds a lot like MAGA and those were the original retards. Im in.
Jesus absolutely no one taking profits on PLTR. Trying to decide if I wait to add on a Friday sell-off or if that will be too late....
Pltr won't stop going uppp...wow
at what point does it become obvious that this subreddit can manipulate the market
In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony god's blessing. But because, I am englightened by my PLTR calls

*tips fedora*
PLTR is absolute crazy. Nobody wants to sell lmao
I made a joke PLTR would be $40 by thanksgiving. Should put my money where my mouth was
PLTR 30 EOD lets go
#PLTR MOGGING TSLA
Had to step away to eat lunch and PLTR calls gained 33%. AMA
The last stock I held that was halted on the way up was TLRY.  But it was at $600 per share, I think.
what the fuck
After this strong of a run, even if there was a 5% pullback it would be bought
PS5 Raffle will be Black Friday, how fitting
people here buying puts on PLTR 
Palantir: I am the new Tesla
Cheers to you fucking palantirians, make that meme money
22c 12/4 PLTR looking absolutely beautiful rn
Hit $29 in 30 mins?
Did I miss some news on Palantir?
I buy puts on anything spammed on here
I am staring at 300% gains and am sweating thinking about what is going to happen if PLTR dips hard this week. Someone talk me off the ledge.
Tesla fed-up with all the attention pltr's getting. what a diva.
Tesla in the corner like Im still here guys
So drop out of half my PLTR calls, then buy back Friday open? At this price you have to imagine a correction next trading day. I like 12/11 calls that Ill try to roll out until 1/15
Any thanksgiving plays to recommend guys? Balls deep in PLTR & CRSR but still have some cash to make some plays. Any suggestions?
We are all going to be richer than bezos in like an hour
Go PLTR I want my free PS5 before Thanksgiving.... lets go, $30 EOW, 
Im so pissed that I cant buy options for palantir with my broker in Germany. Stonks at least 90% up
100 million shares traded on pltr - this aint WSB..  some higher power is working here
Shit MGNI just broke $19.50. About to go on another tear to end the day

Tesla 2000c is on the menu again boys
UVXY IN FREE FALL 
What are leap PLTR calls for 2021 with good Greeks
I didn't want these weekly VXX calls to print anyway
SOLO back in this!
HCAC time to rise and shine.
I like how excited and now scared the movement of the Sauruman is making all of us. 

Like: we really thought we had Rohan under our grip and we got this itchy feeling that Gandalf is going to come around the corner and slaughter us all.
I wonder if the fear/greed indicator can fully capture what PLTR is right now

Im in Sept calls and shares so im not selling ever basically, cashed out half my stake on Friday like a fool LMAO let it ride homie
earlier this week i sold 27 and 28 11/27 calls on PLTR. what do i do

MGNI dipping, buy now. It is the next big thang
ITS DIPPING AGAIN BUY MORE GUYS NOWWWW
I bought like 300 shares of PLTR at 16 but can't pull the trigger on that sell button! Why am I so fucking greedy
Boys Ive never played with leaps before...Jan 2022 PLTR 20c leaps hella ITM do I just sit on these bad boys or what
Damn, calls on WORK up 14000%. 10k would have made you a millionaire.

All on "Talks" between Salesforce and Slack about an acquisition. Honestly thinking about buying some puts 4-6 months out. If the acquisition doesn't go through, the stock should crash back down.
Pltr is dirtier than my ex
you know its a good day when apple isnt shitting the bed
Who wants to buy my PLTR 12/4 $24 and 1/15/21 $26 calls
Fisker gang, we're having three courses for dinner tonight!

Here it cooommeeess! **EVERYONE HOLD ON**
My fellow autists

Secure profits in my PLTR Nov27 $16 & $17 calls and roll them over into new calls

Exercise the options?
Ok I got some nio , xpev and li.. so u can guess ! Will it go up ever again 
If you bought calls on Teslas morning dip you are sitting nicely now
Should I yolo into 11/27 Spy 365c?
Locked my profit in at 26.5 by opening a spread and regretting it lol but profit is profit I guess, go PLTR!!!
Good chance to get in on CRSR if you haven't yet. Cyber monday and holiday shopping still coming up, don't miss out on gains
Expected EOY of PLTR?
It coiled up like this around 10 am and then proceeded to blast the fuck off
PLTR so good no one talking about TSLA going to 569...
Well, you wouldve been a millionaire today if you bought slack options yesterday for $0.01
anyone in amat?
Buying everytime Pltr hits 28
Please, CRSR, some lube first
Oh boy here comes 29
Catch $STM before it takes off.  Announced today that they extended their agreement with SpaceX to manufacture more units for Starlink.

Elon's invovled, so the tards and cash will flock.
Think this is the PLTRy farm? WRONG ! 
sad sad bears wont eat tomorrow
Going vertical again fellas
Come on $29
29! 29!
On Monday my boy was like yo check out NBAC. The only DD I did was that I saw Electric charging and I instantly bought 500 shares.
I'm not a bear but fuk do I want to short PLTR , I don't have the gay bear in me though cant stop that fucking thing.
Just out here waiting for that 3x PS5
In my heart of hearts, I know that as soon as I buy a Palantir call, the bubble will pop
Fuck the salty bears in their salty bear assholes packed with salt ahahahahahahaha
CRSR is fucking up my PLTR gainz
29!
FSR passing through 20$ barrier. With enough volume.

Time to jump in.
Upgrading from 70 inch to 85 inch of I make 20k today (shitty thing is 2 week delivery)

Might as well enjoy the cash if you can
What crazy is PLTR has ridiculous volume at Start of day and EOD. Definitely getting pumped beyond all doubt
  2999 fuckers
tesla bursed 570 
Your better off buying pltr now then waiting on the dip
CRSR wat you doin
Everyone please help encourage solo with rocket emojis and pltr please!!
I bought a single palantir LEAP when it was around 18 dollars. Now wishing i bought more. Up 240% on one contract
To think I chose PLUG for my last day trade today
Anyone need a kidney or spare eye ball? I could really use more pltr calls
Do we want to make a lot of money or a lot a lot of money
TSLA is doing the thing
solo short squeezing lmao get fukt citron
Your making me wet tsla omg 
I knew TSLA was going to tickle 575's balls today but I sold my calls anyways just to be safe. One of them was to break even just to get out of it in case it did continue dumping today. The other one I made 300 bucks on. So while it's good to at least make a few hundo, it also fucking blows goat ass to see I missed out on a grand :-/
TSLNNNNNNNGGGGG
If PLTR breaks $30 Im gonna scream from pleasure
Pltr is the market
My three biggest financial regrets this year:

1. Following Separate-Variation advice and buying SPY puts in April
2. Ignoring my colleague in May when he told me to buy NIO.
3. Not buying more of PLTR when it was still below $20.

Fuck
what the fuck PLTR
A $31 call for this week is up %1700 today
ITS PUSHING FOR 30
What the fuck 29!!!
Bought 40 pltr calls 20 strike weekly for less than buck made 300 percent cashed out now its a 10 bagger damn!!!!
Wow, PLTR allowed me completely forget about losses on EV today. Sometime diversification is really nice.
while we make money on our calls we must upvote one another to further combat the booboo bears
Whos holding PLTR 12/4 $26c thru thanksgiving
Anyone else buying CRSR calls on the dip?
$1M Sell wall at $30 PLTR
I bought a couple of PTON $35c contracts back when they were at 28. I sold them after earnings when PTON hit 42. I was thrilled with the win, and didnt think anymore about this silly bike+ipad company.

PLTR is like PTON, but they actually have a meaningful product. This is going to $100 for sure.
The call/put skew on PLTR is crazy.
I know for a fact that when pltr pulls back, its gonna be bought up so fast. Who knows how many times it can do that though.
Isnt there some retards giving away more PS5s for a PLTR at $30?
Buy JD calls now boys
Feeding frenzy on Palantir calls just now on CNBC
How many times have I told you Autismos. FSR
We sellin at 30 or no!?
Holy fucking pltr
Yo, but when do I switch to puts
Dont miss the dip on MGNI
Looking forward to this sub turning to Thicc Boi and MGNI next week
MY DICK HAVE NAVER BEEN SO HARD FOR A STOCK BRUH
Game of a chickennnnn, take the profits if you must
The premiums on 11/27 PLTR puts are simply outrageous. Who the fuck wants their butthole spread so wide open buying these expensive ass puts?
Need Tesla to close below 570 on Friday and Ill make more money in a few days than Ive ever made in my life. 
BTFD
Price of T$LA on Dec. 21 upon joining the S&P 500?
If theres no sell off then hold until eow
Market closed tomorrow, closes early on Black Friday
I might sell my call today
God for fucks sake what are you even supposed to do here
Are we doing this for the PS5
BUY PLTR NIWWWWW
Okay whose PP is bigger, PLTR OR TSLA?
This is actually fucking insane, I can't believe I bought in Nov 16 after their ER day

I WAS RIGHT AHHHHH
December is historically a fantastic month for markets. Could the bubble go on and on?
My 34C I sold is FUCKED lol
I cant even bear to look at PLTR knowing all the sweet tendies I missed
PLTR 31 EOD
PLTR can break through 30, she has a perfect balance of momentum and stability, just gotta be patient with her
hi i'm Masa Son, welcome to jackass
the value on these PLTR calls fluctuate every second
$31 pltr LWS GOOOO
Pre $30 dip
Adding a little PLTR to a boomer portfolio is tantamount to giving a boomer viagra
I sold half my PLTR position at $14 cuz it dropped from 15 to 14. I want that position back.

Dammit, bought back my position yesterday feeling salty, but damn today is a good day.
Free 3 Ps5s incoming heres my pltr bull post for the contest.  Rocket ship emoji.  Bears r gay.
Oh man PS5 is coming ! I can feel 30$ closing in. Paper handed my 30$ 27/11 call at 28$ for a measly 20% right before it shot up 
Dips getting instantly bought
LMAO so do i finally buy ptlr now cause no way its a fuckin pullback ?????
We going to the moon! No, MARS!

My nio PUT is giving me a sign, shit's about to moon! 
http://imgur.com/a/fAStuwY

Look closely (;
I think I should sell my PLTR calls. This is getting ridiculous.
I was so satisfied wirh my 100% gains on Pltr and now I Wana eat a bullet 
Whats a good PLTR call to buy rn
Is there a PLTR subreddit yet?
BUY THE DIP PLTR NOW
My bank account I mean PLTR is amazing
Highest covered call expiring Friday available on RH for PLTR is $40 and I dont even know if thats safe enough to keep my shares.
#YES I AM PATTING MYSELF ON THE BACK GG

https://imgur.com/a/tR9E7ZU
To the people saying PLTR is a 'once in a lifetime opportunity'  
  
Where the fuck have you been the last 9 months?
Last week everyone was raving about the Roblox IPO, but now it's just PLTR PLTR PLTR
Sold my pltr
GO BACK UP DAMMIT
Good thing i decided to stop selling PLTR covered calls last week...
All in GME
here comes the dip
TIME TO RELOAD.

CHUCHUCHU TO THE MOON
You absolute madlads
DAMP EET
Alex Karp: "I did it for the PS5"
IM OUT OF CRSR, BUYING PLTR DIP INSTEAD
THIS IS THE DIP PLTR
people have been talking about bagholding since it was 21.. 2 days ago, don't be scared by the bears!
BUY THE DIP!

HDOL!
Hold the line Sparta
Thinking of putting the nest egg into RIOT calls expiring early next year
TSLA more gas or done?
Lol every red bar getting bought hard
ITS NEVER OVER BUY THE DAMN DIP U AUTIST MORONS
That was a quick dip
every dip fucking devoured
This bubble is made out of steel so it will never pop. Buy calllss
we going back up baby

why are these bears thinking the dip lasts longer than 2 minutes?
Bears listen...stop trying to be smart, losing money on puts.

The glory of printing off cheap shorts from March has worn off. Bidens supposed shutdown is priced in (heard it here first) and will result in a less than 5% market decline. Yellen wont let him do it without tangible promise of stimulus, so theyll cancel out.

All in TSLA and PLTR. Government contracts are the easiest way to make money, see Deloitte, they have no clue what theyre doing and still print money.

 SPY $450, 6/30/2021. Dont short inflationary pressure, its a losing battle. NOPE and all that math is fun, but good old macro economics is gonna make this market moon...in nominal terms
Why am I seriously thinking about buying more PLTR
8 minute until green open and this entire sub mood swings into raining money like yesterday.
There is absolutely no way the investing (gambling) gods let us get away with THC-B.. something will get fucked up
So WSB mods think Tea Eightch See Bee is a penny stock pump n dump?
Pltr almost down in the 22s...you really think people aren't going to buy?
Relax guys everything is just going on sale for Black Friday
Do you guys remember how dead it was here after the 9/4 drop? Crazy how the community fluctuates so much with market cycles.

How can we signify the people who are here daily from new shitposters??

My jokes are much more seasoned than these newcomers!! You don't know the pain of MSFT $200 3/20 or any others I am too high to remember
If you think about it, Cramer is definitely one of us. He gets it wrong every time.
Whos the gay bear thats been downvoting all the discussion threads for the past week?
BUY THE PLTR DIP
PTLR gonna make me cum !!!
GTFO HERE BEARS. STOP DOWNVOTING
Is PLTR the best stock ever? Better than Tesla at this point? Thank you retards for making me FOMO in at 17, I'll be eternally grateful.
PLTR aid ON track for said $30 EOD today
LES GO PLTRRRR BUY NOW
PLTR CHADS WILL MAKE IT
If you bought $1000 in pltr 30c, youd be a millionaire right now. Holy fuck.
Can we just agree now that PSTH and Airbnb are Decembers meme stonks?
I counted my TSLA chickens before they hatched
I want Cramer to do an AUA (Ask Us Anything) on this sub.
Bears in pre-shambles rn.
Either cash gang or puts today. 
Depends on the weather. 
So far its looking cloudy with a chance of knives.
Is anyone else feeling sketchy about thicc boy investment? Cannabis SPAC merging with EV battery maker with minimal public info?
Pull your $ out of Gyna EV and put it into Murica. HCAC TSLA
Long on thicc bby?
Gonna be some gooood dips for my bulls
I'm probably buying PLTR stock or calls today
Whatever happened to EV today, pretty sure Cramer cause it
You will all be mad when its christmas time and you cant afford to get little tina that new bicycle.. and PLTR is 40 bucks a share..
WTF WHY CANT YOU SHORT CRSR?


BULLS DONT GET MAD YOU HAD YOUR 3 WEEKS TIME FOR RETRACEMENT
This is gonna be a red day
All Im gonna say is trump called the top
I picked a bad day to go all in on chinese ev options yesterday
PALANTARIANS... HOLD THE LINE
Alex MAGIKARP, go! 

Use Predict Suspects and follow up with Automated Drone Strike!
Thanks Guan Yin, NIO and XPEV and bouncing back.

This gonna hurt reallll bad 
If this is really the start of a big dip, I will give the biggest I told you to everyone on the discord who told me last night that I was an idiot for thinking this was near the top.

Too many shoe shiners getting in right now.
Its bullish today not sure why you all freaking out
Tesla stop drilling
Stop freaking out we are in the same spot as yesterday before the ah pump, we all know shit is about to kangaroo here soon.
The EV shit was like a frothy rage. It was clear as day a violent pull back would happen. These things were up like hundreds of percents over the course of a fucking month. Take profit Jesus christ.
Green by open
If theres one thing Ive learned about SPAC life is that when these things keep dipping dont buy the dip. They dip for like 2-3 weeks non stop. Buy the dip when all hope is gone
BABA leaps?
BABA $285 eom?
778,000 new jobless claims? Shouldnt that number be going down by now?
Well I guess I'll get to see how my NIO $49c 2/19 perform on a -9% day 
NIO is getting its wig split. Good thing I didnt jump in this week.
Historically isnt the day after thanksgiving a monster day?
We might be tarded
 It's  so tilting to read all the stories about how "market has best month  since 1987" and to have made so little during it. It literally is not  helpful to know what the market has done in the past, it's useless. In  fact, every chart is useless because it shows historical data. Past data  is useless in predicting the future price.
Buying LI & NIO 12/18 Li 40c, NIO 50c
How long until PLTR gets black listed like Cambridge Analytica data scandal?
I own PLTR too
Might pick up SPCE if it goes lower
Yesterday TRUMP DOW 30k, today we red
CNBC talking shit again, were gonna show them all
Cnbc on our dicks
Aaaand everythings being bought up again 
PLTR 25 eod
NIO: I ain't hear no bell yet

Alright tesla you can pull back a little, but none of that $545 shit you pulled this morning
Legit I think the only thing that will get PLTR to stop growing is the SEC. Like how much can we speculate? What do you think is a reasonable price target?
just fomo'd back into PLTR for 100 shares... almost $700 more than my original cost basis.  I'm dumb.
Anyone think $25.30 is new support for PLTR?

Sold out of PLTR today, was an amazing run but these prices are getting crazy. More than happy to take this massive gain, pigs get slaughtered after all.
 ALL ABOARD THE MGNI EXPRESS! GET YOUR TICKETS WHILE THEYRE CHEAP BECAUSE THIS TRAIN AINT SLOWING DOWN!
Ive never traded options, only bought shares. Palantir is taking off and my coworker just made a shit ton of money because i told him to buy calls, something my inexperience has prevented me from doing. feel like now is as good a time as any to pop my options cherry, but i still dont fully understand how to choose a strike price, or if that even matters for a stock thats rocketing like this. advice??
PLTR go brrrrrr

Problem with pltr is the eventual rug pull, is that the dip to buy more on or sell?
7 years on Reddit wow Im old

With the holiday near I would just like to say that the only things Im grateful for are WSB and PLTR. Fuck everything else I will be eating turkey and taters on my fucking rocket bitches

Tomorrow give thanks to PLTR for thanksgiving.

PLTR hitting 33 EOD!
LAST CALL FOR LESS THAN 30 SIR PLTR
I love you fucking retards. PLTR mfs
Palantir BUY
 The problem with PLTR is that the increase we have seen now is because four hedge funds are buying large amounts of shares of around 30 million shares, another 18.5 million and George Soros a few million shares. Soros has also threatened to sell the holding when given the opportunity. So be cautios with PLTR
PLTR... gets to 31-33, the drops to 22-25, then makes a run towards $40
Does PLTR have an upper circuit breaker?
Meanwhile my RKT shares are sitting in their own piss

Im so sorry PLTR bears...your family will forgive you for showing up empty handed this year.
Sell PLTR now and you will end up like the guy who sold his shares of Apple for $800 in the 1970s and now lives out his retirement days in a mobile home
Call me a pussy but I'm taking my gains and running
Im just gonna upvote everyone to piss off the salty downvoter

Can we WSB peeps start our own etf?

Jeff Bezos is bald and amazon is sliding to the top!
With WSB now taking control of the entire financial market I think someone needs to assemble the WSB ETF. Including TSLA, PLUG, PLTR, SPCE, the whole lot of them. Would love to see how much its worth
For all the people who always bitch about people showing gains through shares and not options days like this is why we do what we do.
Imagine betting against Elon lol green by open
Careful PLTR usually double dips in AM
Cash gang for now . What a rush
BABA rising from the ashes like a Phoenix

Personal conspiracy belief:

Downvote bots have been created to help offset the algos that are trading based on our market sentiment here. And they don't like that we are controlling the market.

I'm getting downvoted in less than a second, and so is everyone else. **GET FUCKED** MMs losers.
Pltr never going to die. If you sell before the end of the year you Will regret
I want in PLTR calls but I'll just be patient for the 24 dip
I think we're on our way back up PLTR
Wow PLTR gang we hit 25 already in 2 weeks.. are we still holding?
Pltr gonna hit 40 today? Lmao

Rage bought 10 x 11/27 @ 26c for 1.3 avg.
Tesla is not a car company. Its a software company. 

Think of it this way, Uber pays drivers to drive around in cars to acquire data to train for autonomous driving. Tesla is the inverse, people pay Tesla absurd amounts of money to drive around in their cars to send them their real-world use data. 

Tesla is going to monopolize the autonomous car industry. Every car manufacturer and ridedsharing company is going to paying fat stacks to Tesla to use their tech. 

Not only that Tesla has some of the most talented engineers and product designers in the world. Theyll come up with new innovations along the way. 

They will be unstoppable.
PLTR 
The big guys were picking up PLTR last night in the 24s AH and some people thought it would bleed today lol

I sold PLTR few weeks ago when it was $17-$18 for a little gains. It went up because I sold.
 My next prediction, 30 by 2:00
I'M NOT SELLING!
Imagine the Morgan Stanley analyst that downgraded PLTR last week lmao. 

This is the most chaddest reaction to a downgrade I ever seen.
This is absurd
TSLA and PLTR I fucking love you guys
MODS!!! Make a separate PLTR forum please!

Every time I have described us as "autistic," I've meant it as a joke... but... Palantir really bringing out the autists
Id like to introduce a new animal to the gang, the **boar**  

 is what happens when  gets extremely greedy, but instead of getting slaughtered, turns wild, goes full boar, and proceeds to shitpost all over the sub with their unreasonably unrealized gains

PLTR DIP BUY IT
you guys are nuts, there are billions of dollars of underlying short exposures the MM has took on from all the contracts you autists have bought. They are forced to now buy tens of millions (just December expiry has like several billion dollars of exposure) of underlying shares in thin liquidity and forcing the price up to astronomical levels.
Woke up from a nap and PLTR is almost at 30.. wtf? I bought calls this morning but then realized I didn't have any day trades so I sold calls 1 strike higher to lock in profit. Guess you can say I regret doing that because that capped my max profit.
GO AWAY GAY BEARS
11/27 PLTR 29p because I hate money
IS IT TOO LATE TO GET IN ON PLTR??!!
Pltr 27$ eod easy
If you arent in Palantir you are literally confirmed autistic
Remember when people thought it was a funny joke to say PLTR $30 11/27
For bulls/bears...

The rally was overextended. Its perfectly normal (and good) for pullbacks to happen so we can regain steam. 

Edit: To clarify, daily indicators (like RSI) are overextended right now and need to cool off.

Next week is the start of the next leg up
world runs on oil boyos... not your gay ass clean energy. fuck that shit.

The central bank could directly finance a lot of programs and inflation would barely reach 2%, they are slowly realising this. We dont need taxes anymore, velocity of money is slow and supply infrastructure is huge, the central bank can just buy government bonds and we can all be rich.

When AMZN stock split???
FCEL back from the dead yesterday!
tesla calls feel like playing poker against these hedge funds/etf's...they're gonna make it look like that shit is crashing to shake-out short stacks occasionally in the lead-up to 12/21, just gotta hold on for the ride
11/27 DKNG 50c gogogoog
I always paper hand TSLA. Got out with $600 Why am I like this!!!
Come on Tesla to $600 you go. I know you can do it
JWN had 44% shares short going into yesterday's earnings. Looks like some peeps getting btfo. 5 days to cover.
The dip was the cocking of the TSLA cannon! Go Elon! Go!
26 resistance stronk
I just flipped from 6 to midnight...like my portfolio for the day.
Lol I think TSLA ran out of sellers
Spy is about to rip
NNDM
Mooning - get in low while you can - going to $12+
I am buy a Tesla with my Tesla gains.
run SPCE 
TSLA 563!
baba double top
TSLA 600 EOD
SPCE on a damn moon mission my god
BABA higher lows higher highs $295 eoy
I feel safe buying NIO "at the top" because this is a pre-holiday dip.
Buy calls, keep pushing this up
If FCEL gets back to $10 by EOW Im gonna nut so hard
He cut his losses?

Given the rise of PLTR....are you putting in a stop loss?
Bro is BABA gonna form a megaphone?? Making me shit my pants
MRO calls gentlemen
Buy the Tesla dip fucktards
Man...Figures. Every time I get scared and cover a short, the stock goes down. Every time I decide to wait it out, the price goes up.
If AMZN hits 3200 by EOW I'm retiring.
If not for the stock split, TSLA would be trading at ~2800 per share

Nice
L.C.A SPAC is free money
Lets fucking gooo CRSR!!!!!
Everything is absolutely mooning (except CRSR which is making a sick recovery though). Bears????? Any comments????? You were full force this morning

Need DKNG to break the wall at 50
BABA such a slow boy
Euphoria past august levels and we have less uncertainty and less SoftBank speculation. This market elevator goes up until tsla crashes after inclusion date when it's 650+

The meme was telling you to buy cheap FDs

Is Nio gonna be going down for a while?
being playing SPCE for months. I dropped it on the launch delay news. And it decides to MOON after that bad news. Bitchhh
LETS GOOOO, RED TO GREEN, up 1% now
why is crsr down?
Virgin TSLA: up 1%, not part of SPY yet
Chad ETSY: up 5.6%, already part of SPY
Amazon halo fitness watch is lame.  If you don't have one, I guess its okay, but if you have a few year old fitbit, I wouldn't bother with halo

EVERYONE RAISE UR HANDS WIRH ME RISEEEBBABA RISEEEE
[deleted]

Tsla fuck it just go to 580
MGNI 
Thank you dude who posted the NVAX DD yesterday!
CVS has a contract with the government to distribute the COVID vaccine to all the nursing homes in the country
Seems like we might be setting up to just explode this aftertoon.

I am thinking bullish, but I don't really see it trading sideways or closing within .75% of either direction. At this rate, a move like that would be sudden and decently steep. Would be just about double the move the indexes have already made today.
Thank you to whoever mentioned WSB Synth. So fkn funny
My FSR calls and shares printing!
11/27 Putties on FSKR?! Ughhh. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
Whats a good dip to buy?
Why didn't you retard ask me to buy JMIA?
Bought the DPW dip at $5.36. this is going back to $11 on Monday. Possible even higher. Short sellers took their profits
don't get scared about BABA bc of this india shit, India is just pissed bc they're not in the RCEP. They'll probably get in later and use this removal of the ban as a "concession".
Let's go apha my sell order should hit any second. Cleared 100% profit on 2022 leaps time to let the house money ride and take some profits
[deleted]
Which dip to buy
The market is done with EV for now. Whats next? Retail or vaccine?
NVDA $600 12/18?
FUBO
NIO, you... you teasing me you teasing me
Sold FSR at a loss yesterday because I wanted out of it. I am retard incarnate.
Tsla 580 ??
Plug comeback??
non-ev mid and small cap tech is taking off today(ETSY!!!)
natural growth
pltr volume lol
This is where NIO digs itself out of it's dip and hits a new ATH
I hate myself for playing spy today. So fuckin boring
Kodak puts for a few weeks out seem reasonable
24c 11/27 up 210% 
All the EV bulls should read up on plug power stock. Look at the all time chart
Elongated muskrat gonna be richest person soon unless bald bezos does something
CMPS is making me cum so hard 
Its great to have calls in WSB meme shit. You dont feel so alone with your losses anymore
When will I learn diamond hands? Sold my TSLA contracts last week for 20% gains, if I held till now it'd be 2000% gains...

Complaining about profits blah blah blah, never go broke taking profits blah blah blah
Friendly reminded that tomorrow market is closed for thanksgiving if you retards forgot
when is FSR going to be given a meme?
Highly negative this morning, now im green. Stonks only go up, never doubt
Higher HIGHER
If you bought the SQ dip yesterday, you are a certified Chad and can come over and Bull Breed my wife with your Superior PP.
Palantarians, unite 
SAN $3 12/18 
DKNG not wanting to break 50.
My 1.60 PLTR c is now worth 3.7 at the moment.
I got PLTR January 2023/$20C and January 2023/$22C a few weeks ago. Should I just keep holding these or cash out and get some further OTM?
Where were you when Corsair said "WHO WANTS FREE MOOONNEEEEYYYY?!" ?
Someone talk me out of TSLA $800C's for 12/18.
DKNG will be $49 for the rest of my life

Nobody talking about JWN that moee than doubled in 2 weeks?
XPEV buying opportunity
How is NKLA not a short for yall?  Lockup ends next week, old CEO is selling definitely, GM deal is dead in the water, car never worked, etc.  Made 20% on my puts this morning, sold because I know idiots are buying back in, and then gonna buy more puts at EOD.

Stock is gonna fall 50% by mid December

Am I the only one bullish on GM here? They have the best selling EV model in China and as the EV market grows in China their sales will grow. They've thrown themselves fully into an EV pivot, invested in so many EV companies and so many GM alums in EV startups like Arrival

What we doing tomorrow boys. I'll probably shill some shitcoin and trade penny stocks on the LSE
Damn Nordstrom...of all things I expected to moon that was not one
RIP JUICE
I ALMOST bought JMIA calls when it was at 0% for the day. Fuck. On the bright side I got more PLTR calls and a few NIO when it was down 5%. Still though. Fuck.

SHE TOLD ME PUT MY HEART IN THE BAG AND NOBODY GETS HURT
So my deal is if i can match my kids college fund with the cost of a car because of PLTR, then i can buy it.  The biggest question now is do I get my lambo in orange?  Or white?
I remember there was a guy who was talking about Nordstrom when it was around 14 dollars a share months ago... he said to buy calls for Jan.... should have fucking listened....
SPY is one weak bitch.
Guys I bought one share of pltr! We fucking rich  af

Tesla was like NAHH FUCK YOU, IM GREEN NOW!

FCEL back to 11?
Let's go Elonnnnn. Pump itttt.
Don't think the short squeeze is working.....
If you dont buy DKNG or AAPL youre missing out on bags

Magnite honey, youre making me throb
JMIA Whoa!

Why do they keep raising the price targets of Roku? Isnt this fucker a stay at home stock?
Why does NIO keep dumping premarket? Is it a lost cause now?
I don't like the premes on PLTR. I DON'T like them.
NIO $55 12/4.. good buy???
Will pltr run more ? I bought 24 c today . Expiry may
Idk, just about every single time I've ever sold Tesla, I've fully regretted it. Need neuralink to deprogram my ability to sell
Is fcel pumping and dumping again or can I trust it?
Can I get another one of them TSLA pumps?
Ive never been so mad I wasted all my day trades paper handing nio.
New SPAC king INAQ starting to take off !! Get in now boys while she is only up 10%

How do you deal with emotions when trading? lobotomy?
What % of you portfolio is PLTR right now? Consensus? I have 20% and itching for more
These dudes on CNBC are all WSB autists like us with their EV trades haha
Retard question: better to have far strike price or close to actual for maximum tendies?
PLTR just casually surpassing its volume average 3 hours and a half into opening the market
Got pltr 40c 12/31 at the top.  Hold me
MGNI and PLTR. Power couple for tendies
Dumping SPCE for WORK was not the play. 
I need some of you to pump PRPL now, k thx
Got pltr and mgni contracts. Hope adding mgni to the mix doesnt fuck shit up for me
Here come the pltr paper hand crew

Peter Thiel gonna come in and unload on you guys.
God damn SPCE.
I sold my December SPCE calls since on the chart  it is hitting the prior peak from July. Also still no update on the the test flights. This might have been dumb 
I am down 29% (up 54% overall) on CRSR on my 12/18s. Dump or hold to see if I can make that back before theta starts to a really hit?
NBAC breaking out again 
If a pandemic, recession, , cant kill off the stock market, I dont know what will
WDAY can meet me behind the arbys anytime
Forget PLTR, its now time for ASIA TO LEAD THE WAY. BABA , FSLY (TIKTOK) AND SE BABY. ONWARDS TO BULL TOWN
[deleted]
Why do I bother buying calls outside tech? Even when I make money it dont hit the same
Poor, risk-averse ppl if you're wanting to jump on PLTR you can get the 12/4 26/28 call spread for ~0.80 right now. Break-even is around 27$ and max profit is ~170%
5 days to the NKLA lockup expiring
KCAC Calls, buy right now

Don't ask questions. Merger approved with SQ

&#x200B;

Now I have back to back to back days of losing 150 plus at opening and then going up 100+ within three hours. 

All I did was buy calls on PLTR and TSLA lol
MGNI taking my portfolio from the grave to the moon
Can gamestop like not be flat
KCAC lets goooo 
And here I thought we'd flat or dip today...
Yooooooooo

APHA calls look to good to be true...what's the autistic play?
Might finally Ca$h gang for Friday and see how we open next week
Why is CRSR acting like this today
APHA 2022 calls a good idea?
After this rally I get to join Elon on Mars.

Will $28 pltr Jan 2021 call pay off?
GOOOOO PLTR

Hold until next week, puts at $40
This work dip is fee money. CRM deal goes through no doubt
Spy just die and give us a healthy correction
I have some $19 PLTR 12/31 calls.  Hold or cash in?
Hopped in a 565 for a day trade and I know this thing is gonna rocket as soon as I give up and sell
Hnnngggg keep PUMPING
If GME short squeezes and it pumps harder than PLTR is now, that will be a once in a lifetime moment
28!!
CRSR, LI, and XPEV straight up murdering my portfolio.

This is not the way.
Feels like the top for tsla
how big is the wall at PLTR $28?
28
Tesla is just gonna breakout soon, I can feel it
RAD RAD RAD
Just want to say Im pretty happy about investing with you PLTR winners. My friend was talking about buying NIO options. Fuck that dumbo
Up 17% on the day

50% on the week

188% on the month. 

DiAmonD hanDs lol. Sell you idiots.
Is this going to 30? Wow thats crazy
Magnite will be $60 within a year. They have no competition in the market and their revenue is climbing. That is all.
Why did I buy PLTR at 26.5 and not when it was at 23.8 Here for the ride nevertheless
When the market is greedy... something something...
Jim Cramer if you're reading this, eat your fucking heart out we're going to the moon 
Jesus christ who gave PLTR retard strength? I sold my calls too early again dammit.
Please give me a ps5 PLTR. You can do this!!!
lolololol 11/27 calls free money

Market gonna close green today just watch
Hold weeklys and dec 4th calls on PLTR or sell eod???
WTF IS GOING ON
ok wtf pltr
My May 12.5 PLTR calls up 500% lmao do I hold ?
GO BUY PLTR
I dont know why every time you idiots meme a stock I say, meh. Palantir will probably crash bc of them today. It never does.
And I thought buying 35c PLTR yesterday was retarded.
AHAHHAAH LOOK AT THIS BITCH
Down so much premarket. Good thing I overslept. Went up between open and now.
Real expectations on PLTR eod?
So Ive been thinking what could be a great meme stock and I think SLV is where its at. Its market cap is 12.85B whereas PLTR is 52.46B and NIO is 71.53B. IV is low asf so if we all start piling in thatll shoot up. Also, someone on here mentioned that if the average account here is $1k (its much more) then wed have 1.2B collectively. This is enough to own 1/10 of the SLV ETF. But as I said we have more than that so in reality we could own 1/5 or more of it. Thoughts?
loooool best day ever
My portfolio going full tard!
at some point we all stop gapping at it and sell right?
TSLA losing steam, good spot to buy puts for Friday pullback?
What the actual fuck is happening
So hmmmm when is it stopping ..
Ho Lee Fuk
I have 1k in cash, need to beef up my portfolio. What are some good long terms?
Yo how tf you see what SPACs are mooning if these f$%kers don't show up on Yahoo finance?
Serious question, what could PLTRs EOY be?
Just sold my PLTR 30C for quick tendies
Damn I sure did sell my pltr call at 26

This CRSR dip juicy
30% up on 30c PLTR bought today. Lets go boys!
Yall give CRSR some time to breathe. Shes up 30% on the week
if this continues PLTR might hit 35 eow
I did the thing. I bought PLTR. But I did another thing after that is a dumb thing. I fix it....
I fucking dumped my 11/27 30c for .40c it's fucking 1.40 and I had 40 of those fuckers
Are we gonna talk about JMIA or...cuz that shit is going african banana's
Sell PLTR 12/15 calls at EOd or hold through Turkey day?
PLTR IN MY CUP

Pltr dip
PLTR on retard strength right now
What does that lock out mean for pltr can someone give me a quick summary
Are we gonna expect these type of gainz with Biden in office
PLTR every red candle has huge wicks on the bottom so bullish.
reason why snow was sought for was its growth, if it can show its still growing, the revenue will be not much of a factor imo,
INAQ is MOONING !! $20 EOY go baby go !!
Guys forget about everything else.

**FSR** probably has the strongest chart todays. And news supporting the continuation. (Citigroup price target & and news about their next EV).

Bids are stacking up

Chart look extremely strong. It will probably break ATH (21.57), today and enter blue sky break territory.
NIO predictions for 12/4???
We're going to find out if selling those $28 PLTR calls for some $32s on Friday was genius or the worst decision ever
What just happened to NAK?
Down only 7 grand today! Wow!!

Mgni is the moves
Okay fine I admit Im in euphoria long GME TSLA PLTR
There is always a bull market somewhere and Cramer will call you insane if you actually find it
AAPL still the losing horse. Unbelievable, green otherwise
INAQ though 
TSA traveller count might be up, but you can buy a round trip ticket during Christmas time from O'Hare to LAX for 90 bucks. No way airlines are making money
MGNI definitely seems like it's on a quick climbto 25 or 30
Has anyone been riding the APPN train?
IM that crazy MF that bought PLTR at opening today at 24.18 thinking I fucked up LOOOOL
One of u retards said the market closed early today and had me all confused, glad I held my tsla calls

Thought I'd time a good dip on PLTR and buy a put for a quick trade and the son of a bitch skyrocketed as soon as I bought it. I also bought PYPL calls @ the absolute top earlier so i'm having a pretty shit day doing some day trades. Let me quit throwing money away and get back to work.
knee deep in andcalls
Whoever mentioned CODX earlier thanks! WOW
NKLA you dogshit company go down
fuck. I have 3k in PLTR 11/27 27C and I think its a bad idea
SPCEEE
Where to go when RH marks me a pattern day traders?
Bought a put to hedge my long PLTR position.
I bought 1 11c May 2021 on PLTR when it was at $10, sold at $14.5 for a tidy 3 bagger. Yeah me :(. Only lost out on $1,400 so not quite kill myself territory haha but I feel like I'm missing out on the fun here
Soooooo, where are we at with stimulus talks?
Imagine paper handing your tsla calls earlier
LGVW is going nicely today
How many days after breaking and holding the 25k account balance requirement will PDT flags be removed?
SPCE!
Why did I panic sell my TSLA weeklies this morning  at least I have longer calls
I wanna gamble too so I bought weekly puts on it. I hope someone dumps a massive order on the market at the close to create an overnight panic. Shit happened during Teslas huge run before the crash and triggered a major selloff. I know this is retarded but Im bored
thank you lord elon i love you
Is there any news on crsr, I know it had to have a down day but this was a straight dump.
As a person who has CRSR and PLTR only I have neutral feelings today
Anyone holding ICLN calls? Post your positions
I have a PLTR 12/11 18c bought for 2.40, now at 10.45. So I can sell an OTM call on the same date to lock in profits? Is that how the vertical spreads work?
I want to make $10k/day working my ass off for 3 months then take a break. How can I do this?
Nice and consolidated, here we go boys
ps5 incentive really put the the heat under pltr loll
What we thinking about CNK retards

Finally got out of Tesla at the top.. locked in those gains, thanksgiving baby lets fucking eat
PLTR 12/18 22c, hold or sell? Roll it over?

ONE MORE DIP PLEASE!
Damn totally got fucked trying to buy PLTR puts
Whens the next Tesla split?
Bought a grip of GOLD, BP, and AAPL leaps. Now I gotta pick what color lambo I want...
All these comparisons of PRPL and PLTR make me angry
Selling tsla at eod or holding?
Crm to 300 by next Friday
Fat fingered a $20 short put for $30 up front on PLTR. Stock has risen $3 but premium went up too lol--PLTR is saying "keep the damn premium".  Wish I picked a higher strike.
VALE pumping
Damn my iras daily gain just outpaced my options account lol

Edit: Oh fuck its all cause of mind med lol
Who knew a data mining company with no morals would fucking blast off 3x IPO price.
dollar tree and work puts?
BTW where's the undo button on this game
Can someone help me understand this? I have a PLTR LEAP that's ITM. I also have 100 shares. I sell a covered call that will probably expire ITM. How does robinhood decide what to sell to exercise that option? Will they sell shares first or is there any way to predict it?
Holy fuck
I was called a retard *checks notes* 13 min ago for buying 11/27 $30c and Im up 25% on them lmao
TSLA had a huge sell wall at 570 and it churned through it. Its going up hard
I told you the moment pltr got positive pr it will blast off, this software behind the vax distribution is huge news
Need an underrated green energy stock
Tesla 
How many people are going to miss the FSR run up to ?  
I just want to see what Cramer says, someone please post a video when it happens
PLTR got me hot and bothered
Entered ratio spread on Pltr when it was 17, long 25C,short 2x 30C

Need pltr to stay at 30 until Dec18... Probably not going to happen
PLTR oh yeah oh yeah lets go oh yeah 

&#x200B;

Feels fucking good
SOLO goes from down 10% to up 10% it is the true definition of a meme stock.

# he boght?
HERE COMES THE DIP BEFORE $30

I...guess I could always buy even more?
NKLA down 11% today, buy the dip?
I cant even laugh at the paper hands anymore. I just feel sad for them. They must really hate money!
Ps5!
I want to be here for 30
My god here it is
Feel like I need to start hedging PLTR with puts
BABA go to $280 you sexy bitch
We need banks to upgrade it
I love you PLTR hopefully I can time the dip right
Im selling PLTR before 1pm PST. Ill see you retards after break, I may be an autistic fuck but i aint riskin it lmao

Mara coiling.
I had 4 21Cs this morn for pltr. I sold 3 of them and decided to ride the last one today. I just sold the last one for 2x the price of the others ones. I'm not complaining... I never made this much before off of 24 hour option plays. Profits going into PLTR stock for long term holds.
HOOO LEEE FUCK PLTR
That dude that said he'd give ps5s for everyone that commented I'm gay if PLTR hits 30 by EOD is sweating hard
Night night bears. It is now a BUYden market.

Dont what's worse. Having missed PLTR all together or being like me where you bought shares and sold covered calls agaist them
Yikes. Looks like Im diamond handing these 12/4 35c now
Ah yes, got stopped out on all my calls just before they doubled in value. Very cool, very legal.
Thank you so much for this dip! Im in 21 more 30 11/27s

Oh man. The downvoters have the day off today hm? Oh wait they dont have jobs.
Anyone else read pltr as pluto
Sold my PLTR and TSLA calls this morning for the guaranteed dumped today
If you made bank from PLTR please for the love of God take some profits or buy some shares in something not as volatile. 

Not saying I think it's gonna crash but I've seen it happen many times before where people get stuck with nothing. At minimum take out what you put in.
Are we panic selling today?
PLTR call whos with me
Imagine thinking this isnt a green day lol.
If u think this is a dip wait till u see NIO at 35
Xi congratulate BIDEN.. Donnie fucked
TESLA STOP

Selling my Tesla stocks and going all in on PLTR. Retarded? Probably.
My wifes boyfriend didnt piss in my Dow 10k mug today (he says he says their bedroom is too far from the bathroom) so I have a feeling PLTR is going to rip today
Thinking of plopping my cash into THICC BOY, the ticker that can't be named
Dont let the bears eat !!!
yea im buying PLTR this shit is gonna hit $25
TSLA and PLTR going to mars today
Lol some salty bear on a downvote brigade, like how sad is your life if this is how you spend your Wednesday morning 
To anyone that I reassured that PLTR would be okay, I think its safe to say that you owe me at least 10% of your tendies.


Thanks 
This PLTR short squeeze will see us back at $20 sometime 
Is it really likely that people from this Reddit page are the reason PLTR is pumping?? Lets be real boys
Buy at this dip for pltr
Damn CRSR really testing my patience
GME LIFTOFF CONFIRMED.
Hot damn. Is the GME short squeeze starting to happen?
So theyre just gonna ban any mention of SPACs, which are probably some of the safest bets out there??? Cool I guess. Where else can I talk to other tards about them?
Made 40k on $PLTR, bought at DPO.

Fuck me I wanna take my weekly 165% PLTR option gains and walk but also I wanna be here for 11/27.
Why the fuck didn't I buy pltr yesterday
Tutes are STILL loading PLTR at these prices.
A Chinese EV pump EOD would really bake my cake.
MARADONA SOCCER LEGEND DIED !!

Wtf bro holy shit
Oh no Im bout to.. Im bout to... BUSTTTTTTTT! PLTR you bad bishhhhh
salty bear mass downvoting lol in shambles
Best thing about palantir is that its not even a meme stock. Gonna keep growing
29.66 come on baby lets grab some ps5s
After BIG JOE, PLTR is my president 
Sold pltr yesterday @ 21 lol
Imagine going with nio and not with pltr lol
Hated myself for getting out of NIO at 53 just to watch it climb, not feeling bad anymore.
 downvoting once again
Reassuring to see tesla up while nio li and xpeng all down
I dont think pump and dump rules should apply to SPACs
I think my favorite part the Daily Discussion threads this week is the amusing ways people come up with to reference Tetra Hydro Cannabinol Beast stonk ticker 
BABA going green?
Looks like meme mode is over 
The euros are buying the pltr dip and profit taking thc bee
Anyone else balls deep in thicc boy!
Overstock lookin phat at open

OSTK calls
Of course buy the dip on EV.  Buy American EV like TSLA and TH\`CB
Imagine being long Xpev or Nio rn 
So maybe putting all ma money in EV is not a good investment strategy hhhmmm
So 569 is the new resistance.

Nice.
#CRSR 50P 12/18
so looks like a large sell off at open. will we rebound throughout the day or will it keep falling?
So all the meme stocks are crashing, fuck
Just need the lil homie CIIC back at $27 thx 
HCAC stop fking around
if you degenerates dont buy the SHELL dip you quite literally hate money
Does the market not understand that stocks only go up or something?
gLAD i BOUGHT spy POOTZ
robinhoodies furiously googling how many dips should i buy and what happens when it dips again after looking at their EV stonks this morning.
MP is simply taking a small break before it enters the second inning of this massive bull run. Incoming hammer cock green candles get in there boys
Whats crazy to think is that if you wouldve held everything pre covid you would be up 16% still
Market is closed pretty much the rest of the week. I wouldnt expect any major pumps to come. Probably gonna be flat and gay
Damn this aint hardly red what gives
Buying otm Pltr calls on this dip is like god giving tou a second chance
Who's laughing now Tim Apple bullies . 
TIL the rest of Reddit hates Elon Musk
Loaded to the tits in spy puts
BABA gonna see $300?
Why is Palantir going down
IF TSLA opens down, we'll be back above $550 before 10ET.  Load up if you can.
[deleted]
We sellin baba at open or what foreal????
Buy NIO and XPEV today seems obvious.
Every single day European stocks open high because of American pump then slowly bleed down to lower average. Every day.
GEN X superior generation checking in
Only have 1500. Should I buy the dip in nio,xpeng, corsair or PLTR?  I'm leaning towards corsair or pltr
BABA is recovering , back from injury.
TSLA hype into S&P will continue to take it up through December or Tesla Recall erases hype? Which factors more heavily? I say the former
Tesla 600c 12/4 going to be cheap!
BABA leaps will be good at open
NVDA 600c lets go!
Can chyna  chill ffs 
Fellow chinese EV autists, do we cash out or ride it out down and back up to the moon?
Imagine losing on both your call position and your hedge...
XPEV is on a nice pullback. BUY THE DIP!
Hope everyone has fun today
SPY opens flat, remains flat all day.
EV opens big down, but gets bought up. 
No idea about other stockz
Reports of china EVs deaths were *GREATLY EXAGGERATED*
I hope NIO goes back down to $10
Why is this the only market subreddit constantly spamming PLTR
Sentiment too high here. Puts at open, calls EOD for Friday.
Hold on nio dont go anywhere without me
SPY tanking at noon today
It appears RH has engaged   on BLNK
anyone remembers msft when it was the hot stock here? lol
Gotta love Tesla's tact for announcing recalls on already down days.   But perfect opportunity for buying a small dip before it bounces back up.
LGVW printing spicy tendies pm
Im scared to look how down XPEV is in pre market
Green!
wish.com is still going to ipo even though their entire business model is legitimately illegal in selling counterfeit goods.

Only in America
ICLN and BABA calls this morning
With all you retards buying each other PS5s, is it time for calls on SNE?

Dip getting bought. Stocks only go up.
CRSR is drilling!!!  Another 10% and I'm back in again.  4th the charm.
Bum ass bears didnt stand a chance
There she goes!
PLTR is just insane lol
I told ya guys to buy AAPL yesterday. My technical analasses showed that it will spike this week.
Palantir gonna pay for my hooker tonight
being openly gay 70 years ago would be easier than being openly bearish right now
Tsla too high imo
PLTR 50 EOY
Elon pulls up to the club in a cybertruck with his goth musician girlfriend

Jeff pulls up in an Amazon van, alone
Sold my PLTR calls yesterday, shouldve held till today but still happy with profits
Can any of the alpha retards here answer me how you find these mega earner memes like PLTR? I always ignore these pieces of shit, but Ive noticed quite a few work out. Whos finding this shit before it go 90% up?
You fucks better hold between 10-1145a. It will get rough right there
APHA boutta bust out o lord
Just sold and locked in my gains. Happy thanksgiving to me.
NGL PLTR is the femboy stock to Teslas biogirl 
FSR finally going up
[deleted]
Just got 100 shares of THC  can someone tell me what it is now?
Ok optimists, think were going to have to have a little pessimism on this pltr trend. I went all in and am holding on to a string of hope
EV gang needs to engage thrusters
Why is red dildo bigger than green dildo? That's just so unfair!
Out of pltr..   buy back later


Trimming every thing
I would definitely compare the content I see here to a crackheads behavior. I just watched yall get high as fuck for like 20 mins and now that shit wore off.
Get in loser were going to 100. (PLTR)
CRSR back down to Monday levels, time to get a few leaps on the table.
Ummm is CRSR going to recover
BABA  rise like a phoenix

How is CRSR still dropping wtf
Hedgies keeping GME below 14 kek
I literally lose money on everything except meme stocks
Ok whos the retardude that told me to jump in SQ yesterday. Wifes bf says thank u
Just threw the rest of my RH($450) into PLTR weeklies because of you retards. Holding because I have no day trades. Havent been on Reddit in months I hopefully going to the moon, fingers crossed.
If you retards arent buying this CRSR dip then you just hate money
Is this a good dip to buy more CRSR and NIO shares?
Im crying, cant take profits at a loss
Sold all my EV for $400 gain 
CRSR is a quarter of the LOGI market cap and people think its over valued. Theyre literally gamers paradise and make more than peripherals. BTFD
OFFICIAL CHYNA GANG SYMBOL -> 
SPY pump fake and gay. Lets see -2%
Buy pltr dip
Only down 12k today which isnt bad seeming Im up 50k over last week
Just here to get downvoted by the sore loser.
Holy fuck is the GME squeeze actually happening today?
AAPL and DKNG ready to fly
Gme going up but my call going down, shorts really trying
Crsr will be back to normal on Monday since thanksgiving and Black Friday are around the corner?
Sony and MSFT telling console buyers more inventory will be coming to retailers before the end of the year - please stay in touch with your local retailers.

Is it just me, or is this ideal scenario for GME? People constantly returning to GME store or website until it becomes a habit, spending more time and money at GME, further cementing their brand.
What's the difference between jam and jelly you ask? NIO can't jelly its Chad cock into a bears ass
Man am I glad I bought sq calls last min yesterday
PLTR leaving the stations soon
At this rate, I will be a PLTR millionaire.
Thiccy Boy go!
Thinking of selling my AAPL shares to buy more PLTR, CRSR, XPENG and NIO. Is that a stupid move?
PLTR makes dumb people sound smart.
Fuck. I sold too early
Microsoft, it's like you're not even trying.
I thought GME was fun, PLTR is better. NOW THIS IS PODRACING!
Whats happening with GME? My PS5 hasnt even shipped yet
Mega tip: REI-UN.TO

Riocan Real Estate Investment Trust

Property group, look at the chart, this is guaranteed to go up big time once things start to go back to normal. It was trading close to $27 before the pandemic, its currently sitting at $18 and I got in at $15 just a few weeks ago, and its climbing up ever since the solid vaccine news came up. Even if this doesnt go back to its pre-pandemic price, its expect to at least go back and stay above $20 soon.

Also, as a bonus, the divs are distributed monthly. So if you put in $20k rn, youre getting a monthly return of $133.00

Short term and long term gains to be made, its an easy buy.

Edit:
Also, look into Simon Property Group (SPG), in the same vein.
Will PLTR go higher? is it too late to get in?

PLTR has beasted so hard that I was able to close my 16/17c 12/18 spreads for close to max gain, which would normally take until expiry.

THC-B is worth at least a small investment simply due to the massive growth potential compared to the minimal downside. If you dont have at least 1-2K in there youre missing out.
BUY THE DAMN DIP
Okay, PLTR gonna crash now. Sorry everyone. Please mark this comment.
Sold pltr and crsr at and of day yesterday. I finally did this right
If you bought $5,000 worth of long term PLTR calls 6 months ago you would be a millionaire today.

Edit: someone check my math
SPY falling, PLTR falling, DOW back under 30,000... It's gonna be one of those carnage days

Switch to puts or at least cash at open for sure
Fuck you
WHAT A DAY TO BE A BEAR 
Everyone remembers how Peter Theil pumped and dumped TLRY, his other meme venture? Now he's moved on to "big data". I fully expect this to run to $400 and then dump back to sub 100s.

Got PLTR call at $27 12/11. What are chances it hits above 30 by December ?
SHOULD I HOLD MY 11/27 $17 call for PLTR??
I'm going to short TH CB. Gambling that the SPAC expires worthless. Ultimate gay bear move

PLTR ROX
Stop downvoting all the comments.  It hurts my simple brain
Dear Jim Cramer, since we know you read this, here is a message.  Stocks only go up.  Meme stocks go up twice as much.  We merry band of RETARDS have shown that making money in this market is fucking *easy*.  Quit your bitching and hand-wringing and get with the program.
next week there're going to be a lot of pltr pivoting to THBC
Any thoughts on Corsair. Starting to get nervous.
Whos spending their day downvoting every gains comment? Sad lmao
PLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLTTTTTTTTTTTTTRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR BRRRRRRRRRRR
You guys holding PLTR overnight?
These gains don't feel real..
Aaaaaaand my PLTR puts are negative again...  lol
Think of the poor soul who sold these PLTR weekly calls.
Sorry, but Im buying PLTR pits because it feels like free money. Anyone else?
I expect a massive dip before close on PLTR. That would be the time to buy in on 12/4 calls
Buy the dip!!! FLY TO THE MOOON
STILL TIME TO GET IN PLTR
Sold pltr calls way too early ($26.75)... someone make me feel better
whos in for the PLTR ps5?
Sell all your PLTR at market close. 20% drop coming EOW followed by more gains next week
wait guys this dip is big

"And that's why Daddy had to suck dick for a living for 15 straight years to afford your public  high school tuition my son" 
Guys I really need advice. I am feeling suicidal and need help... My mind is driving me insane. 

PLTR is the first company I ever felt confident to invest 10K in calls ending in December. I decided not to and I purchased shares then. It rose too fast for the past month and now when I look at the calls I am confident of buying, I see a 260x ROI at $26. Even though my shares more than doubled, I have never felt more depressed and suicidal in my life. I tried smiling, even selling of my shares at 10K profit and deleted RobinHood, yet I can't forgive myself for buying shares instead of that call... The one call I never felt more confident in my life. The only one Call I truly wanted to buy but hesitant too. The once in a lifetime opportunity to be a millionaire... I'm now immune to the price, dropping $20 or rising $20 in the next minute won't make me feel any better... 

I think some of you may have experienced this before. Punching the wall till you bleed, cutting yourself and just wanting to give up on life for the once in a lifetime opportunity of becoming a millionaire. The 10K I was so confident in and ready to lose back then. I may never get the chance again with this level of confidence. I hope I can feel better after today, after deleting the app and getting a nap... 

I know this is not the place but I really hope some of you which experienced this previously can share how you overcome this torture, how you get your life back together knowing you made a mistake that costs you millions... When your life can really change with the money.

Sorry for shitposting and insult me all you want at my ungratefulness. I feel slightly better writing this but am still in unbelievable pain right now...

Edit: I really truly appreciate all your comment guys. I will take a break from trading and from this forum for a while. There are other opportunities out there. I had the gut right feel that time. I will be back stronger than ever. Cheers!
Is shilling PLTR still on the menu boys?
This is pretty much a PLTR and NIO thread. WSB is ruined
Why is everyone getting downvoted again lmao
The 1% needs to push full student loan forgiveness. Ever since the forbearance started, my student loan payments have gone right into the market and into their pockets.
RIP NIO
Anyone buying plant tear on open say aye 
does anyone still believe PLTR will go green 
Imagine thinking toy cars with AA batteries is a sound investment
Looking to put 5-6k on 3-4 options today -- any non-idiotic suggestions?
Yachty, you sick fuck!
Bagholders in EVs will justify insane valuations of stocks like XPEV, which is now worth slightly more than Honda, on lazy ass DD that's tantamount to nothing more than 'GyNa iS BiG!'.   When XPEV is worth more than a top automaker like Honda it should have been a huge red flag to sell and to take profit cause the sector is widly overvalued.
THC what is going on
Teeth cleaning today.   Not impressed with waiting room.   The down side of onlyfans is all the good looking whores don't need to work.

There has to be a bot downvoting lmao.

I dont know what to say really... 3 minutes to the biggest battle of our professional lives, it all comes down to today. Either we heal as a team, or NiO will crumble, cent by cent, day by day until were finished. 


Were in hell right now gentleman, and we can stay here and get the shit kicked out of us, or we can FiGHT OUR WAY BACK into all time highs, and climb out of hell. 1 cent at a time. 

Now I cant do it for you.. Im too poor. But when I see all these retarded faces... I mean...  just buy the fucking dip.

Anyway, hop on this one before it takes off again!
Holding my 20c 1/21 pltr call like 
This is type of price action you wanna see for PLTR going into the open..theres always a slight rug pull if too many green dicks opening up.

3. delete etrade app. (will reinstall in a year or two)
PLTR has passed the Great Filter...again...
And everyone was saying today: Buy the PLTR dip. WHERE'S THE DIP!!!!
PLTR is the green rocket fortunes are built on. Hop on now or miss out
PLTR baby

PLTR has retard strength
If you are waiting for the imaginary dip on PLTR you deserve to lose all your tendies

Close out your spread on the next trading day

You know TH CB got hyped a lot for only being up 10%
CRSR DIP ACTUALLY FREE MONEY
Ya the market might shit itself today. But hey, steam sale is in 3 hrs. We can lose our cash somewhere else for today.

What upsets me most was that RH didnt let me buy Palantir with margin back when it was around 10 and I kinda just wanted go all in and delete my app until I was able to day trade again
Pfe calls is free money
Lots of PLTR hype, next Thiel meme stock to be medical magic mushrooms ie. $CMPS? See my post for autistic dd
Government just gave 1.1 billion to ginkgo to make pharmaceutical materials for covid tests. Kodak jumping today off of speculation that government might follow through with their loan as well if they can be cleared by the SEC. If you want a huge gamble buy far otm kodak calls two weeks out
Anyone else really enjoy it when a stock takes off even though analysts downgraded or downplayed it? You know an analyst is looking at PLTR right now and screaming "Stop buying you fucking dicks, you are making me look bad!"
APHA free $ calls

You have to open your eyes and look at the moon. If we do it collectively, the soundwaves from our mouths will force the numbers in our favour. 7:00:00 PM EST tonight please set alarms
So tired of losing on every single play. Im out till I rebuild my capital boys.
Robinhood-> PLTR-> 5Y 

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Think PLTR going to 26.5 or 27 EOD? Idk if I should sell at 231 profit or hold to higher. 11/27 25c 27c and 28c btw
A gaming company, popular among streamers for its quality. In the middle of a pandemic that is going to last a considerable time. Vanishing from stores due to demand  Just before the black Friday and Christmas. 1/3 of the market cap of Logitech. Seriously, can't go more free money than CRSR.
Bought CRSR, SBE, BLNK, PLTR at dip and watching them rise
Tesla puts bought. Im full bear
NIO going green 
Just dont be a pussy and sell now. Its only going to raise up next week
Just so everyone knows...$PLTR is in a massive gamma squeeze. Will 100% be crazy swings up and down.  A straddle is likely the play here
Up 254 and Idk if I should
Collect my winnings now or wait for potentially more
odds of pltr 27 eod?

Bought some extra TSLA lotto expiring Friday. Paper handed this morning when it turned red. Ofc it goes back up
HOW ARE YOU LOSING MONEY IF YOU ARE
If you are poor. Buy PLTR, thank me later
Just remember I sold pltr Jan 23 $25cs last week for $900 each like a jackass
My first couple weeks in this thread and you guys turned my account into a money machine.  Lets fucking gooooooo.
Sad I sold all my CRSR stock but glad I used it to buy PLTR calls
I sold a PLTR $34 C expiring next week this morning, and I'm already wondering if it's going to go ITM on Friday
So happy I held Nio.  This thing isnt stopping until we hit 100
Jesus NIO. Go green already
PLTR MAKING ME COOOOM
I was tripping about buying more Palantir at $25 dollars today. I dont regret doing that anymore. Ill just hold this stock until I turn 45. So thats another 23 years of gainz for you wallstreet cuckolds.
Black friday about to be renamed black friday but in a different way. SPY 340 EOW
Is RH glitching here? I have a 33c 1/15/21 on slack and now it's worthless
Sold my PLTR and made 8K....might buy back in during a dip

Old man Buffet making bank on his pltr investment.
What is institutional ownership % on palantir
Slack up 30%!! I put a grand into it yolo
#common tesla break through it
How do I sell Options with a limit price? That's how I make the most right? For example. If I wanna sell all my 5 calls with Limit of 26.75, does that make sense? So if it drops to 26.75 it will automatically sell?
wow maradona died.
https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/

Anyone knows what usually happens when we hit extreme greed
Bagholding GME calls
I have PLTR 1/15 21c and 2/21 25c. For anyone whose been ITM this far out, whens the best time to sell
MGNI 20 today.  22 Friday.  25+ next week.  30 the week after.  Dec 18 calls expire.  Dec 19 I quit my fucking job!
Reading these comments would never guess most of the indexes are red right now.  Not that index that matters on here, the Meme 10 index.
If you listen to any investing advice from a reddit user let it be this one, you need to jump on the JMIA train now because its going to rocket to the moon over the next ~~year~~ month
PLTR is love! PLTR is life!
Hold PLTR to the end of next week or will there be a cheaper buy in due to the holiday?
Sold 25 strike CCs on PLTR yesterday, why must I bring shame to my family like this
Just bought more PLTR at the top fml
Alright, my PLTR 2022 $30 leaps are up 130% in just a few days...so sell or keep?

The same PLTR bulls today will look like the NIO bulls on Friday. 
DO NOT SLEEP ON MGNI
$600 for an FD. In and out today. 
Any pointers?
it honestly seems like PLTR and TSLA are competing for attention right now
wat is happening how are some stocks "down" what is this
Buy pltr in this dip
Remember:

Option values dont fully account for the additional 1.5 days off. Great time to sell calls and puts, diminished value in holding. Many MMs will get out of options that arent hedges by EOD.
TSLA lets go!!!
Codx flying
TSLA... thank you for... just being you.
TSLA ATH is 569.69 i love it.
Just thinking about those pops through the $30 PLTR and $20 MGNI walls 
Tesla 900 by eoy
Really close to creating some spreads here. Out of day trades and wanna just let it ride but this seems like it has to pull back Friday at open might lock in some gains now
I need Palantir to announce a partnership with Cloudflare or sth
Hell yeah. I just hopped on here before checking the market and I see a serial downvoter. Only bears get that bitter which means market must be up. That's what I like to see! Woo!!
So would you bet that PLTR goes to 30 today or not? I think it's way more likely that it will than won't.
Whats our new meme stock for December
This shit is better than porn
PLTR 22c 12/18 are so deep ITM, that I might need to sell and roll it over.

When will the PLTR bubble end tho I'm getting so scared of holding
damn bought some shares of PLTR at 25 thinking I was a dumbass buying the top
YO WHATS THAT GREEN DILDO PALANTIR
Bought a 30c on Palantir $3 ago and it's gonna fucking hit today LMAOOO
Oh must have missed a decimal point in my financial reviews.  PLTR actually double the value calculated on Monday.
29? 29 who? no we got 28 and 30 around here.
Wow. PLTR 
I increased my 250 PLTR to 420 PLTR when the markets opened. The meme is everything.
Burned a day trade FOMOing PLTR. Doubled my money in an hour. I regret nothing. But seriously you retards, TAKE GAINS before EOD. Institutions are gonna dump AH almost guaranteed.
My PLTR shares I bought at 27$ are so happy rn lmao
Idk when to sell my PLTR call I think I should use the money to buy a warmed bidet
PLTR eod $30-32 but $35-38 eod friday?
My May $30 calls I bought at $17 are about to be ITM, this is fuckin nuts
MSTR calls for the inevitable holiday weekend digital money pump
Sell PLTR today or hold to infinity and beyond?
Is PLTR gonna dip after 30??
Where are the PLTR bears?????
Palantir is scaring me now.
To the  who bought TSLA puts how do you even explain it, I mean calls going to shit fine, but explaining to someone you shorted one of the coolest brands in history must be really fucking embarrassing
PLTR puts anyone?
So happy I sold my PLTR calls at open :)
Sarumon>Soros
We should all pump winners like PLTR instead of trash pump/dumps
But when to sell pltr?? Thats the question
If PLTR is a 55bn company NET deserves to be at 40bn the least.
Losing to theta is just lame smh
Man I wish I held my PLTR calls longer
Im getting off this rocket ship... 4k - 11k today is fine with me.
Sold my PLTR calls. Will buy back I'm later at a higher strike price. Didn't expect 30 to be hit so soon
PLTRs gotta have pretty good resistance at $30, right?
How many people bought into FSKR thinking it was FSR?  shit went up crazy for no reason rofl
I wanna sell calls on PLTR because the premiums are good but fuck I dont know if its worth it
PLTR FUNNA GET WVERYBODYS CHRISTMAS GIFTS
Someone bought $170/190c spreads for Mar21 LOWES. Massive bullish bet, ~30% of the $170c were left naked.
pltr is fucking insane
Salty bears downvoting everything. Please buy more puts lol
This has nothing to do with PLTR, so I apologize, but do yall think DKNG touches $60 in the next few weeks?
Imagine missing out on the gains and a PS5
Thanks palantir for existing, you are making every single person in this sub rich. Love you $PLTR

I am thinking of selling today and taking some days off, who else?
I cannot fucking wait to buy nio at open holy shit. Ive been waiting for a pullback for what felt like ages
Big buy walls at $21 and $22 for PLTR, most likely just supports.  Sell wall at $23
We beat the weekly jobless claims by 6%! Nice!! We going up boys
Dont think the market will move much till next tuesday
you MFers had me thinking the entire market was red. just recoup your losses on EV with credit spreads and calm down
I think we will end green. MMs dont want to go to Mommas house for a Thanksgiving dinner with a bad taste in mouth. Besides Mom will serve cold turkey to son who couldnt even pull a Green Day on a Thanksgiving eve.
i <3 oil
It's time to finally sell NIO and get in on PLTR 
BABA returning to the grave again
Literally would not have believed that dip got wiped before the bell if I hadnt seen it myself.

A red day is expected before the long weekend.
NET woke up and chose violence.

The market is only red if you allow it to be.
Time for a BABA day trade.

I just sold the fuck outta BABA, tired of that shit
What is my pension fund and others even doing with all the money? They don't make shit even if you go in with the highest risk profile

I am up the same amount and % as them for the whole year in less than 2 months. Even if I sell everything (including my loses) will still turn out more profit than they do.
Diego Maradona dead - time to short cocoa

Is palantir going to dip?
Mgni is the new palantir buy in asap
How much would one need to invest in calls for PLTR to make a significant profit? My husband started options after lockdown. While he has made some good gains, it is nothing in comparison to what I am seeing here. I know it is all a gamble, but fuck. Everyone loves money.
I bought PLTR yesterday at ATH and got fucked at close bigly red. I panic sold this morning at a small loss. 
Why havent we memed jmia yet

I've given up the dream of becoming rich from options and not having to work at a real job. I am actually probably happier learning new things than I would be if I was bored with a shit ton of money
I think tesla is glitched, I've never seen it red before.
If PLTR opens red, the world ends.

So glad I sold my AMZN calls and bought everything but tech, SPY, WMT, GE, GM, NIO
Jobless claims haven't really mattered since they've stayed flat and within range for awhile right? I can only think of 1 or 2 Thursdays since Sept where we disappointed estimates and ended less than -2%

On this team we TEAR OURSELVES and everyone else around us to pieces for that CENT
WE CLAW with our fingernails for that CENT. 

Because we know when we add up all those CeNTS... thats going to make the FUCKING DIFFERENCE between winning and losing. Between LiVIVING AND DYING. 

Now I cant make you do it. You gotta look at the retard next to you, LOOK INTO HIs EYES, now I think youll see a retard who will buy that dip with you. You will see a retard who will diamond hand for this team because he knows, when it comes down to it, youre going to do the same for him. 

Thats NIO gentleman.

Thanks BLNK for free $
KODK is up to its nonsense again
New strat: sell all the puts you can on pltr and pray you get assigned
Goddamn have held SQ on the big dips and not held it on the big runups.  Such an idiot.

VXX COME BACK PLS
someone tell me why MCRB (seres) would have a job offering on their Linkedin profile looking to hire a marketing Director positions and sales for their Late stage 3 Cdiff drug if they didn't know FDA was greenlighting it? Also, assuming this gets approved how much would this trade at? 100?
CRSR is not volume climaxing, this is kind of just a slow drift downward. Both low volume selling and buying. I think it is time for it to consolidate around the $40 mark.

I think I will hold my shares, I am not seeing a definitive reason to exit right now
FSR baby!!
Fubo to 30 before pltr you 
Last day to get in QRTEA/QRTEA before $1.50 per share dividend. QRTEA trading at 11.48 right now and you get $1.50 dividend per share. FREE MONEY!!

What strike and date to sell covered PLTR calls?
MSTR 500 EOY
Maxar Technologies up 5% today on what?

Why the fuck all the biotech stocks mooning?

FCEL rocket ship leaving earth soon...
Looking for a low IV leap? Look at SAP
BABA hit it's head on 279, needs to shake that shit off and kick the door of 280 down.
Why is JWN rocketing?
I forgot
LETS FUCKING GOOOO DKNG YOU BITCH, YOU FINALLY BROKE $50
wish nvidia would hit 540 today . might be a pipe dream but ill hold these FDs for now
If you got BABA at the dip, do you take profits hoping for a temp pushback? Or wait even longer for it to keep rising?
Airlines are pumping so the get good money for their equity offerings.
lol forgfot about my CRSR puts. up a  measly 10% on them.

they were barely down yesterday too cuz of IV

shit is just too OTM i guess (Feb 30p)
COST WOO!
Almost back to green come on baby
still remember the song i was banging when i bought 29c 12/4 PLTR at the bell  and they ripped a 100 percent return in 5 mins
GOLD GANG RISE UP
RIOT flexing
With the dollar collapsing again once the europoors are done, if correlations are still active, the market should catch a bid
Anyone else gamble on AMC fds for tomorrow??

Too late to buy PLTR calls?
Guys I said IPOC yesterday Im saying it again  today 12/18 12.50C

DKNG finally break 50
How come theres no hype on fang
airlines dont give a fuk.
One of those days where I give back to the market. $26k so far, feeling full retard
Not too late to play DKNG or ACB
the hell is going on with APPS, down 10% yesterday and flat today
Do i sell my 12/4 pltr that i am up 260% on and buy longer dated calls? I dont want to miss the real run up to 50 the the eoy.
Spy nosedive for me
Everything losing steam,  what still has some legs on it for the day
Raise the rates
Load that FSR dip
Come on clf youre literally 3 cents away
I thought my nio leaps are crushed, but thank God it isnt as bad as i thought

Dal save me!
Oddly enough airlines could have some *minor* room to run before settling. Look every airline is going to be half or less it's pre corona value for a while. Travel isn't going to have a V shaped recovery overnight.
AMC quietly humming
35x 11/27 AMZN 3100/3105c debit spreads. Currently worth 92% max value. Would you close it out or let it ride? AMZN would have to go down over 2% by eow
LMAO KODK
Mods unpinned my fire DD I was proud of that shit. I kinda wanted to have a gang all to my own.
I guess the SPCE launch was rescheduled to today

Anyone playing fsr? 20eod?
How the hell do you guys hold leaps? These things are amazing.
INAQ anyone? Auto insurance disruptor

The last 5 days of fisker bashing are finally starting to pay off
Got out at the top of BABA!!! I'm sure it will come back but, it aint doing shit today.

TSLA just keeps fucking with my emotions like I'm a battered bitch and I don't like it
Time to roll PLTR back into DKNG
What if this is the week funds start to FOMO buy their required TSLA shares, realizing it's not dipping under $500 again and TSLA shareholders are crazy and never sell?
SCAC

So are we moving into FSR now?
Thoughts on SBE long term? They own 70% of the charge space.
SPI
DKNG is just getting started
I take 3-4 days steady gains. Everytime I list all my gain back in 5 min.
Im holding my 11/27s on Tesla I bought td fuck it
PLTR usually has 2 dips every day. lets see if we find another re-entry point today.
When the fuck is JD gonna pop
Just sold TSLA, I'm probably a  but I locked in gains and will check back in Friday. 

Good luck everyone! Friday is a half day!
Seeing that Roblux won't be a direct listing like PLTR, is there any chance of it seeing as much growth this quickly?
I wouldve made so much money if i just bought my contracts and deleted my broker app logged in once a week and sold

On a different note it blows my mind that PLUG is sitting at $25.  I remember after the crash it was getting banned from discussion and labeled as a penny stock pump
Get in Tesla now if you want to make some money today!

Retard strength baby.

WORK
I have 10 WORK calls, am I rich now?
SLACK
CRM BUYING WORK????
God I love parabolic stocks.
Crazy thing about this Slack halt is it has plenty of levels to trade off on the way up. Usually I see things halting up when they've never been that high before and its just much easier for it to plummet
Fuck you baba. Fuck you.
$WORK popped and halted.

Slack has been creeping up since mid 20s with suspicious call flow lol

Apparently Salesforce looking to buy 'em.

How will this affect $ZM?
Any DD on Telos?

When are the FOMC minutes released today?
Sold pypl at the top, not sure what to do with the money now...pulled some gains out
buy the dip
I dont care about tsla valuation , or what the stock does. It feels normal that we have 500B companies whose stock is full of special strength. 

But that should probably tell you that something in the markets is a bit fishy.
Damn I should have bought that Tesla dip at open smh.
Sell SBE shares at 35$? Average price is 13... worried
Slack just get acquired?
Too late to get into LGVW?
What's the extremely hard resistance for AMC at exactly $5? It seems like it's been mega testing that but there's a massive sell off every time it touches close to that mark historically.

I know they're in the death throes (unless they can somehow get a cash infusion of some sort) but it's weird that this stock has stabilized at a value so high above normal bankruptcy stocks.
[deleted]
Crm getting wrecked

Correlation != Causation, but NIO was 1.96, and is now around 50 bucks. PLTR started at around 9 bucks. Let's see  how far it goes up guys.

So would we consider the sell off this morning as a correction or consolidation?
Well FUCK MSFT and AAPL
Funny how they rotated out of biden stocks this morn and into tech. Trapped everyone in tech, and now back in biden after they scooped up the dip

My tendie senses are tingling... here we go PLTR

Think there will be a Thanksgiving selloff for PLTR or should I go ahead and roll out calls for next week?
I have a question for my tax geniuses. If Ive lost about 85% of my portfolio, but gained back to about 60% of its original value using short term trades how does that work?

Should have gotten more dip, DOCU CRWD CHWY
Ok serious question/ should I jump into JMIA again???? Its up 25% again wtf
Hey, since when did Robinhood allow you to withdraw cash on the same day that you have sold options? I thought funds had to settle for t+2 days before withdrawal.
So APPN went from $60 to $150 in a month on no news whatsoever. Totally natural and not rigged movement in our fair market.
UNREAL

TSLA about to break out right after that PLTR dildo... damn I love this shit lets see it TSLA
I think itd be fun to see TSLA at 600 EOD
O fuk, TSLA doin that thang again.
They should name the Salesforce (CRM) and Slack (WORK) merger Workforce... or Slackforce whichever floats your boat.
Giving CRM all of my energy and good vibes  
Having a hard time figuring out if I should burn a day trade on the PLTR 12/4 25c's I bought earlier today. It'll only leave me with one left but what the fuck is the coming week gonna hold? Do we actually expect this to keep mooning through Friday which is already going to be a half day for trading?
why does robinhood keep saying that I can't close out my PLTR short puts that are worth 0.01 because they trade at 0.05 increments. let me make some money smh
80k wall between 29.5-30
Stocks only go up.
SBE... Would you sell shares now if you trade price was 13$ or hold?? Scared about the typically spac crash.
Never thought BlackBerry would be relevant again
Acb slowly but surely

TSLA with that nice healthy growth. If everyone is cool today and Friday, it hits 650 - 700 by end of December.
PLTR consolidation making me nervous.
BABA green EOD and I stop playing for a lil while
Watch shitron say something bad about PLTR
Get in on DKNG before you see 10000 commercials this week for it. Haha.
Imagine if I had held my 10 VALE $12 1/15's instead of paper-handing them a month ago to FOMO into some meme stocks that immediately crashed.
I owe Elon my life
Today I plan to talk to my $AAPL calls and ignore my children.
If my calls are for 29 for Friday and it gets there today does that mean I would want to sell or the higher the better??
I dont know what I want more of PLTR or TSLA?
is my 12/18 60c crsr fucked. do i sell or hold
Gap really wanting to "gap" down am I right?
I have a confession, PLTR just sucked me in
Pltr lets gooo 
fed minutes in one hour
Remember when Luckin' happened and everyone was talking about how Nio was next (When it was like $5)? Were those claims unfounded or nah?

If market mooning wont pick crsr up then I guess Im fucked lol
Is big money trying to cuck you out of your PLTR gains?
I sold half of my shares of PLTR at the top (at least the top for now). I will hope for a nice dip to buy back.

Load up boys this is the new bottom

Sometimes I second guess letting Cathy Ark manage a chunk of my money but then I remember she's better looking and smarter than me.
Should I hold this 12/4 25c on PLTR or sell now? I have no day trades so I guess  I get locked out for 90 days if I do this? Not sure plz send help. Thanks
JMIA JMIA JMIA JMIA JMIA 
is a 2DTE call on PLTR just stupid to do right now? Don't have much buying power, or I'd go further out.
SOLO wants to get back into your good graces
spy is hilarious
Here comes Elon...
God bless Alex Karp and Papa Theil!
Buying a ton of ATM UVXY calls for 12/11  
  
VIX got sent to the shadow realm in the last 3 weeks. One of these days, it will save me and my overleveraged ass.
Finally the DKNG rocket ship is taking off. Almost bought PLTR calls at the top waiting for this one
Who's calling top
So my tsla 600c 11/27
More more more
When do I sell to buy back in at a new strike price. Im up 250 % on 1/15/21 23c PLTR and trying to decided if I hold or sell and rebuy

It is just not stopping for anything
Methinks this is a cool down more than an actual red day

SPY hasn't tanked hard enough for it to be a correction, IMO
Me: damn these 60$ out the money Tesla calls expiring in a day are cheap. Probably best not to gamble

Me 1 hour later: oh cool, could have made 300% on Tesla returns. Glad I bought msft further out for safety and avoiding a bubble and lost 10%

FML
Tesla going parabolic everyday this week

When algos sell EV premarket but run up fisker 20 percent on an analyst upgrade lol
Im telling you guys, get into MGNI during this dip. Its literally free money
cashing some out of pltr and parking some funds in APXT, holy fuck what a great trading week
Yall. Dont forget about INAQ. up BIGLY today after announcement that the SPAC will take a auto insurance disruptor connected to Tesla public.
Holy shit WTI oil crossed $46 and I didnt even notice

Is there news I missed? What a fucking rip
Almost bought spy puts this morning. Glad I inversed myself
Killin it with ASAN today.

Play the trend boys

Pltr puts on sale, sell EoD
Fuck I wish I was approved to sell naked calls
Hold ACB and AAL till Friday?  Could we get vaccine pump before Friday?
What we saying, up or down??
Gonna buy some XPEV calls
Holy fuck look at work. I guess Salesforce is in talks to buy them
Replace the meep with pltr in that one spongebob episode and you have an accurate description of the wsb daily thread today.
Look out pumpers.
These buy candles are absolutely massive. Im confused as fuck
That thing, your SOLO put. Give it to me
BTFD
Nbac 
SRAC just got a big push
NBAC let's go!
Where are my VALE bagholders? That's why I bought a Jan 2021 $12c because even if tesla had announced anything with them, it would take a while to ramp up. Up 200% now.
rotate though FSR.

You guys already squeezed all the juice in PLTR. Don't be the last one holding the bag.
Making hundreds every morning
Follow the smart money. Im in $170/190c debit spreads on LOW Mar21. Get in before take off lads! 

Risk ~400$ to return $2000. Phenomenal. You cant afford not to at least look at it.
Say it with me. FUCK CHINA
PLTR needs correction. Too many pumpy retards here.
I swear to god you retards buying NIO have never even been to China.

I work in private equity and regularly work on deals in China and there is a serious lack of parking in China. Many people in tier 1 cities street park because they live in 30 year old buildings with literally no underground parking. You think people will buy EVs and charge them where? This isnt America where everyone lives in houses with garages. The real money is in parking management in China.
Imagine investing in Chinese EV scams
 Lol feelsgoodman to be short NIO calls rn and long "thicc bb" rn..
Lmao I got banned from r/investing for saying "Good for you fg" on somebody that was bragging about his gains
Have any of you morons seen The China Hustle?! Almost every chinese company listed is 100% fraud bullshit. Yea go ahead and ride the wave but be real, theyre all scams lmao
downvote if gay
please take pltr profits
# $200 to $1.2k PLTR calls ez game
PLTR CRASH
EVERYONE PANIC SELL!!! GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN !!!!
When SPY eventually goes down to $330... which it will by end of December... Im throwing my entire account into SPY calls idgaf
Anyone buying the PLTR dip rn
Who the FUCK is selling Tuscan? This is NOT the way!!! 
Nio gonna tank back to low 40s today
TSLA sell off = SPY loses money = bears feast
PLTR IS CRASHING YOU FOOLS
I feel like some people dont actually want to be here and comment out of pure salt. Go back to your boomer subs
As expected PLTR got another boost from zoomer hype on TikTok. Either sell EOD or hope for more hype over the weekend. Tough. Might dump on Monday. Then again. Its thanksgiving and zoomers probably gonna tell their family about the new goldmine and boomers gonna rush in on Monday. Might keep for Monday.
[deleted]
COME ON LES GOO PLTR
Sold PLTR at the top....I think....I hope....fuck.
If the market is forward looking, why are stay at home tech stocks leading the way up today?

CRSR tanking retards
crsr taking a dump
HERE COMES THE RUG PULL. HOLD YOU TINY COCKS!

Chinese EV chatter went from flooding this thread last week to near silence today. Highly likely that tons of communist-loving autists got wiped out.
EV bubble popped lmaoooooooooo
Shit coin tanking!

Get out while you can
See how CRSR way down today? If you are not buying that you are a fucking idiot
Cash out my PLTR for MGNI.

I'm about to buy $ROPE after I sold 55 25c PLTR this morning. Would have a 20 bagger if I held.
Thats it, time to short PLTR
My inbox when futures are green at 8pm: literally 20 retards I've never heard of tagging me

Guys idk how you dont make profit when you can just change the time on your phone to the end of the week and then open up your Robinhood and see the future
why in the fuck would you buy PLTR after two back to back +13% days and 7% moon today? are you guys unironically fucking retarded?
##ev stock car-mageddon is coming

Should i stay in baba?
Poor Xpeng and Nio.  O well.
Headed for a blood red day boys, do the wise thing and dump at open to avoid being a sourpuss at Thanksgiving dinner
Palantirs general manager Peter Thiel proudly waited outside the Wall Street trading floor after the final bell to give Alex Karp and the FDSEs on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Friday afternoon. Cucked gay bear Andrew Left yelled out, There you go! There you go. Money printer Jerome Powell gave a look of pleasant surprise. An army of autists screeched out, We got an [expletive] squad now. And before Peter hit the rocket ships door, former Wall Street great Trevor Milton hugged him and said, Yall look so different.
I will change my name to spce if spce hits 100
u/dum_townerino is kinda mean...youd think hed have better things to do than be a big fat jerk!

Holy fucking shit when do I sell PLTR

I hope Tesla drills all the way back to 450
FSR finally! almost sold my position to cut losses yesterday. this might even end up getting my account out of a deficit
PLTR execs sold off a lot of shares this week
AMZN downvoter 
Why did Robinhood change the from screen where you now see percentage change and not the actual numbers its gay af, anyone know how to change it back ?
Just loaded up on NIO.  I think this is bullish move last 30 minutes.
How tf do I always time the top when I buy my calls
Anyone know whats going on with CRSR?
Thats the dip boys. Everything going back up for the rest of the day.
CRSR having a PE ratio of 70+ while logi had one in the low 20's never made sense to me.  Sure its an ipo, but corsair is not a new company, its growth opportunities can't be that much better???   Anyways logi making better mice and keyboards atm..even for gamers imo.
SOLO WAKE UP UBL TURD
working on fixing my paper hands.  Every option I buy drops briefly and I sell then moons hard.
Amzn  it needs some boost boys and the one girl in this sub. Puts some  to let this reach $4500 by December 31st. 
Grabbed another 100 CRSR shares, will sell a covered call on it when 60c 12/18 is worth $500+ again
my daily question: do I sell my PLTR stocks before close today or hold through the longest weekend in history?
We back in on BLNK?
Tuscan Dumpings
MOON DRILL RED GREEN HURR DURR
2 weeks ago was down 3k all now down only 500 ... feels good, been making smarter moves(and dumber) since the Sep 4th sell of got me
TSLA is the best play in the market.  Even if you fuck up and time your buys wrong, you have the backstop of the S&P.  They will buy whatever short-term mistake you make for even higher price later on.  Just don't buy weeklies and stick with Jan 15 calls and you're pretty much guaranteed to make money.
Robinhood is wigging out on my phone haha
ASAN looking good today.
Guys everything is going up and I don't know what to buy
Im a bear but this isnt even a red day. This is bullshit. Get me -2%
When we selling boys
[deleted]
Buy Pltr
I cant be the only one thinking about shorting Palantir...
That work rocket was fully legal, fully organic.
Anybody still buying into PLTR? Fell like it's due a major dip soon?
IM CHOKING ON MY OWN CUM
Sorry but please allow me to vent my frustration... 

I made 10K on PLTR by buying and selling shares (sold at 26, won't look back). I could have made 2.6M if I bought Calls when it was $13... And this is legit the first and only company I am confident of buying calls in. 

Don't know if I should feel sad or happy. Im legit depressed I missed the chance of becoming a millionaire... When I could have click on the Dec 31 25C but hesitant too... I think I'm going suicidal thinking about this...
Serious question:  How exactly do you set a stop loss
PLTR puts orrrrr???
Need some help bought one call of PLTR ex this Friday. What do I do when its Friday. It says I am 250% up
EV bubble facts:

Top 37 automakers market cap combined 1.91T $ with EV companies accounting for 37% about 688B (TSLA, NIO, XPENG, LI). Now, Ford which is 16th in the list sells about 550k vehicles per quarter whereas all the top 4 EV companies sell about 200k vehicles per quarter. 

Side note, Toyota annual vehicle sale is 10.5 million units. People who are buying TSLA at 560, I want to know what is your ceiling?
Calls are still cheap on MGNI
is it just me or are the daily threads getting less and less fun to read? its just turning into stocktwits, pumping the meme stock of the day
COTY on sale right now, get in and retire next month
Well I clearly sold my PLTR too early. Goood thing I have shares
Pltr puts rn
I was right, 29 by 1:30
REAL NIGGAS HOLDIN TSLA 12/4 $700 CALLS
Theres no way PLTR hits 33 by Friday right?
Is it time to sell PLTR its gone up 200% in a month. If not what price target you selling at.
dildo to 30 and we can all rejoice with Ukrainian pussy cum.
When pltr hits 30 its gonna sell off hard
NIO holy shit 
Sold $pltr enjoy the ride guys and don't forget that what goes up, comes down eventually

The only thing I regret is not buying more NKLA puts. Should have gone all in and max margin.
MGNI has been STRONK. Next PLTR, get in while theres still time boys
I blame XPEV and BLNK for running so retarded to cause this ev pullback

buying 300 shares of SBE on the dip now, its super discounted. Shit is going to 
Are we selling our positions before close cuz no trading tomorrow :(
The cover calls I sell tend to go up a lot but I have yet to be called. Is this because the option is likely changing hands and being opened for a "new" higher premium that keeps it out below breakeven if it doesn't continue to rise
ILL BUY THE SMALLEST FUCKING DIPS ON TSLA
Should I sell my THC at open, rotate the money to buy NIO and XPEV dip, then sell those two at the end of day to buy back THC? What are the odds that THC confirms the merger this week and goes 200% without me?
FSR options looking good. Glad I dumped most of BABA, PLTR is a long play, 630 is gonna hurt still
FSR rising up.

Fellow autists, is it better to sell monthlies and LEAPs when you're safe with the profit even if it's far out, or wait till closer to expiry?

RKT moons right back to even at least lol
NKLA retards show yourself!
AMD should bump price of their offerings. People are charging double of the price cause of supply shortages on consoles, gpus(majnly nvidia) and cpus(and).
CRSR should definitely not go back up but it absolutely will. I'm not selling
I just yoloed on APHA
I can't wait for the Cramer memes this evening they're going to be fire emoji
What the XPEV?
YES ELON BRING IT DADDY
PLTR fueling with 110 Octane pump gas, taking a short break
Not sure why consumer cyclicals are doing so poorly around this time of year. They guarantee profit with holiday sales. Things like $DLTR shouldn't get ignored. There's going to be many thrify shoppers this year.
Wrong way BABA, we just made it through 277 now don't look back
many retail dip buyers in the chinese EV names still.

their hopes will soon be extinguished
To all the retards who doubted $JWN

lol
Just realized that MRNA never goes down significantly the same day when it gets a news pump hardly even a correction after the initial pump... Is this thing entirely propped up by Algos trading news?

Dumped  THCB till friday I'll buy when the market close. What's the play boys, Xpev, Nio or CRSR dip or that PLTR nectar
SPCE tho 
I cant believe no one notices SHOP in this sub.

C'mon riot $8 isn't hard, and after 8 things just get easier. Give it a try.
What pltr calls do you guys have?
SPY FALL U PIECE OF SHIT
Mara riot next meme as coin approaches 20k. It's happening.
IM FINALLY GETTING THE FUCKING HANG OF THIS SHIT
Dumb question because Im an idiot. But is there a difference between selling my call and exercising it? Im not doing this because ptlr 30 eow but Im just wondering
Fine.  You people broke me.  I bought PLTR this morning.  Shares at open, haven't hit the strike (and apparently probably won't) on 12/24 28 calls. 

Thus, this is probably the top.
My dick almost at hard as good TSLA candle
[deleted]
563 is the line in the sand
Where just a few hours in and pltr volume is already at 3/4 of the average
There is some crazy bearish divergence on the hour chart.....
robinhood buying the NIO dip for what seems to be the 100th time.

so much retail capital been deployed to make sure this thing doesn't go down. when the big boys finally decided to dip the dip they're gonna get destroyed.
Bears had us in the first half *OF THE MORNING*, not gonna lie.
$300 spending power left. Double down on PLTR, or is there another 3 week out\~ play worth doing?
What do you bench, and are you a bull or a bear?
This flatness is killing me
Every EV is getting hammered yet TSLA only drops couple points
what are the chances AMD breaks $100 by earning next call. Given that they are supplying all the GPUs for the next gen consoles... I kinda wanna buy some long calls.
Realistically speaking.. wtf do I do with my Jan 2022 10$ call lmao is it just gonna go further and further in the money
Next diamond in the rough is FSR. about to break 20$ psychological barrier. Next stop 21.45,  then blueskybreakout.
I will enjoy to see how Tesla shits himself 
I was deciding between two recent IPO's PLTR and another, took the one that's not yet a meme.
Are we selling off today?
Daily Corona dump

Anyone have any thoughts on NKE making a run up to earnings in two weeks?
Do I buy back the PLTR 24c I sold? Would cost me about 5k to buy them back...and I'm already up 100% on the stock, even at $24.

&#x200B;

Also up 200% on leaps
I really need SPY to go parabolic
HCAC preparing for lift-off
HTZGQ on the road back to $60 after surviving the FF 9fake flu) scare, watch the numbers of rentals shoot up this holiday season like flights seem to have returned almost to normal (number of flights, occupancy not sure)
It's true, wsb controls the market. Look at Pltr just look at it and convince me other wise. To bad most of you are cock gooblers and will suck that dick first chance you get and abondon us
XPEV BUY THE DIPPP
What is Tesla doing man...its scary
Kandi to the fucking moon. Fact that it went positive today from -9.5% proves its got a strong backing.
Anyone buying the CRM dip? They have earnings next week

I want to know what that smartass "Google engineer" who was shitting all over PLTR at earnings is thinking now.  Not so brilliant now, motherfucker.
Just remember when UBER IPO. They were $50 and fell down to $13. Now its a tech company thats rebounded back to $50. HOLD FOR BIG BOY GAINS WE FOUND SOMETHING WALLSTREET IGNORED!!!!!!!!!!!!
Waiting for a dip to buy more pltr is frustrating.
Why is PLTR up?

There's going to be a day that TSLA comes back to earth a little bit....and some lucky bastard is going to make money hand over fist buying puts right before that happens.

Won't be me because fuck trying to predict TSLA, id have bought puts multiple times during this crazy run this last week, but some bast is going to get rich
I sold all my PLTR $19C exp 11/27 at market open Monday for $1.00 per contract

Any good theta positions to hold over turkey day?
TSLA looking down at Earth at all the people that didn't buy the dip
Papa musk
Any catalyst for rkt or is this dead. As soon as I sell I know it'll go up finally.
Lmao SPY is red? Who would've known
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Well AMD has woken back up
Even Kodak is mooning
I wonder how many people see spy red and think the WSB yolo crowd isnt absolutely euphoric today
If you want to make money in this market just find any stock with a P/E ratio of less than 30 and sink ever dime you own into it.
Bears are like but we will have a massive sell off today..... lmao yea right not when the market is on crack
Potential meme stocks to get in early on?
Sold out of PLTR.. $15k gains in a week but got paper balls to hold for longer thanks Papa Thiel
Every time I check up on Tesla its just up another $5
Btfd PLTR
PLTR vertical! Again!
The autistic prophecy of retarded dip buying has been fullfilled, congrats bulls !
Im retarded. Someone help. I sold a put on fidelity but decided I want to set a stop loss. How the fuck do i edit it. 

On my stocks theres a big blue button that says set exit plan but it does not appear on my options
Just like that baby.
Remember what happened last time we came back from a day the market was closed?

Wow, PLTR really just wont die, unbelievable.
Imagine missing this once in a generation fucking cash explosion!! 

Pltr 
Right, real talk. We holding, selling at 30? As a Brit, I have zero idea what Thanksgiving does to stock.
Get in on REGN before its too late
Pltr really is memeing to the moon

Lets get that PLTRstation boys!
Someone talk me out of buying into CIIC
sold my tsla call too early damn feelsbad to fomo in or wait for eod ?
Does PLTR remind anyone else of RKT before the correction? This seems like the peak of euphoria.
wday boutta go on a run
ITS HAPPENING
Thoughts onAPXT?
I started my first time last Thursday. I think I came in a pretty good time
You guys are talking about PLTR IV as if IV crush is the reason our positions would be fucked lol.
Do I hold or sell 2x TSLA 565c 11/27
pltr nutted and it just keeps going

&#x200B;

what a g
When PLTR blows through $30, the momentum alone will push it to $35. Updraft will push it.
when will my 11/27 40 pltr calls pick up some delta?

serious question
Fuck I didn't see this comming
The promise of tits was all it needed to launch 
AAPL eod target?
I saw NIO at $57 and knew it was going to dip the next day but didn't sell. I'm gonna trust myself this time and sell PLTR once it hits $30. +55% in a week is good enough for me
So proud of my palantards. We done this
Selling the 35 Covered Calls for PLTR expiring Friday. Ez Theta
Plz wait till Monday PLTR i will have the settled funds then too go long on calls plz slow down I dont got the buying power
Any Villanova people in here?
IM FREE FALLINGG
Thoughts on CIIG/Arrival?
Just shorted PLTR now as in sold 15 of the 35 strike calls this week for 60 cents each. That's 900 bucks. All it has to do is stay below 35 by Friday. Should be easy money.
Y'all need to donate to a food bank with all of your profit. Really profiting off of the suffering of the less fortunate who've lost their jobs as the rich continue to richer. The market is just purely fucked
PLTR will tank today to get all of you paperhanded pumpy retards out. Good riddance just stfu about PLTR already
[deleted]
Shit talk ev or pltr in here and its automatic downvotes 
Bought $PLTR puts because it's about to crash.
Dow Jones gonna take us from ATH to ATL
WTF PLTR -2% premarket?!

I want my money back! Let me speak to the manager of those so called "United States". Either you guys start buying or I look you up on Google and leave a bad rating!
NOOOOOOOOO my trailing stop loss triggered for CRSR !!!! Im out with 80% gainz on shares FUCK gonna buy the dip asap
Wsb dead. All your memes are die
PLTR top reached.
Todays theme is rotation out of fake Chinese companies
You guys probably dont even know what PLTR does
Are you worried PLTR isnt sustainable?
[deleted]
Anybody buying PLTR puts?
[deleted]
Bullish WSB is a more pleasant place than Bearish; can you guys just make a sub for yourselves? Xoxo

Nothing but positive vibes in here
shit is rigged nothing has changed since last night
That was the top!  MMs dumping their bags on us!  SELL! SELL! SELL!
DIE NIO
We might actually have a proper red day on our hands. 
BABA be down once again
Why is mentioningT H C (anned) on this sub?
It'll be a red day for Palantir today, buy the new low and hold.
$NIO - huge buy opportunity at open. BS Reuters article pulling down sector. Chinese government only looking at an OTC EV and some other EV.
We might not ever have another Green Day again.
Tried to tell everyone to take some profit on CRSR, hope you boys did. Still a good stonk, but there had to be a pullback, it doesn't have real meme energy.
Beat thing about PTLR is playing with money you dont losing (not much mind you) but not having that feeling of impending doom that it might crash is awesome. To the toooooop lol
\* pokes TSLA with a stick \*
GME said ay PLTR Im the meme now
What if we dumped PLTR now?
Can't wait for the +2% SPY day where PLTR drops 30%+ that ruins WSB
Take profits in pltr and re-enter. The big boy are pulling out!
Sold my PLTR so u can thank me when it shoots to $30 eod

Futures were so much greener last night. What happened?
PLTR please dip to $22 so I can buy more
Chinese EV companies are the biggest hoax
Yes... burn motha fucka, burn...
Buying that PLTR dip = sitting ducks going to get destroyed today. It's painfully obvious to the MMs.
HOLY HELL, JEFF DONT DO THIS TO ME. YOURE HURTING ME

Pltr drilling. Getting a worried about the 17p i sold
PLTR and NIO died to give birth to LGVW

new meme new dream
AXPT (AvePoint merger), CIIC (Arrival merger) and LGVW (Butterfly merger) 12 month price targets?

What are the percent chances that THC merger will work out ? 

And where to be sure that the stock will redeemed for 10$ plus 22 cents if failed ? And when will that redemption happen? 


Any help would be appreciated as I have gotten in a heavy position on it.
Time to buy puts on PLTR?

If you missed PLTR, TH CB is the next one according to the DD guy who called the CIIC run up.
If anybody here is holding Chinese EV companies, this is what you get you un-American fucktards.

Edit: PLTR to the fucking moon
Just sold my palantir, get out before the next guy gets out at a better price! Stonk is due for a 10% pull back then buy back in
Pltr looks ready to fall off. Sorry not sorry.
Got a few 11/27 aapl 117C... think they'll print?

Alright whats XOM doing today? I dont understand the fucking oil rally.

Nio is so dead
Don't forget to tell your wife's boyfriends to buy up on THiC Boi. You gotta look out for family.

MGM weeklies puts are gonna print
Good time to own tech... its green
Go look at the NFLX 90 day chart. Compare their show listings to any other cord cutting TV. Look at their valuations ($600+ according to some analysts) and look at their current price. 

Theyre recovering from over reaction to the original Vax news. Calls arent cheap, but neither are you. Some states about to mandatory lock down again, sentiment is rolling back to stay at home. 

NFLX 31 Dec 500c
I have apple , Amazon , Sony , Microsoft i dont see any red
I was saying yesterday the rotation would come
Poor CIIC.  Could have doubled my tendies if I sold at open yesterday
BABA puts today  BABA got banned in India
So many good plays outside of meme stocks if you guys just open your eyes. I'm in TSLA and PLTR too but mix it up a little so days like today don't hurt as much
SHOP 1000c expiring Friday are the move. Jobless claims higher, WFH stocks gonna see a little boost today + Black Friday/ cyber Monday gonna push shop back to monthly highs. Get in while premiums still low.

Last chance to get into tech. It's been sideways for 3 months.
Baba faded huh
have any of y'all investing in  even googled it?

/u/ComputerTE1996 -- if Microvast is so good, why does their website suck and their social media (LinkedIn, Twitter) seem extremely sketch? I get that their main business is in China and maybe they've just been so focused on R&D that they're somehow neglecting marketing/sales stuff, which is why they need a SPAC, but goddamn it seems sus, and the founder of the SPAC has a pretty shady looking background too.

I'm not an experienced trader at all, but this seems extremely sus all around.
Wtf is even happening?
Come on you paper handed fucks
Done playing bluechips earnings after $DELL beats by like 40% and goes down 3% for no reason, same as RKT 2 weeks ago, only playing earnings on meme stonks from here on out.

Should I get out of NIO and just take a small profit? The whole Chinese regulation thing is making me a little nervous
Youre on actual crack if you think Tesla goes below 545.

Why is spaceX mooning?

Coronavirus is the only thing Americans are gonna get for xmas.  The quantity of people traveling for Tgiving and the size of average gatherings is retarded.  Americans basically give zero fucks because 'much freedom!'.
NIO $5 EOD?
I just dont get why microvast would go with Tuscan for ipo. Surely there are other SPACs that arent ex-weed SPACs out there, right? Might that hurt their image in some sort of way?
So if WSB are leveraging the algos into anything we bid up, why dont we all donate to charity and then all the algos rush in and now world poverty is solved.
PLTR absolutely TANKING rn
Let me have your attention for a moment. So youre talking about what? Youre talking about, bitching about NIO that didn't go up today, some son of a bitch that doesnt want to buy your worthless calls, some broad youre trying to screw and so forth. 

Lets talk about something important. Are they all here?  Well, Im going anyway. Lets talk about something important. Put that coffee down. Coffees for winners only!
Gonna be a huge sell-off from profit taking at opening. Dont even think about loading up until 11 am
FCEL trying to remain relevant
1.6M reddit users on this sub.  Many active. Once a name like PLTR starts trending here with all us retards buying bulk short term OTM calls, we legitimately can cause gamma/short squeezes in stocks like that when you add it to all the normal volume that accrues from big boy action.

The market has reached peak retard levels.
V shaped recovery on PLTR
50$ to 1000$. Thanks qqq nio pltr


Fuck you plug.

comment insider info below
If it breaks 26, next stop is 30
Cramer got what he wanted.  Looks like we are selling
That PLTR dip was expected. You could have bought below 23 premarket and sold over 26 at the peak. Absolutely retarded not to do that if youre a swing trader

Edit: Im not saying you should have done that you autistic fucks Im saying that we dipped because *other people did that*

For anyone considering the weed sector I'd advise you to look into APHA. It's not as exciting as some of the other meme-y weed stocks, but it's a good company at a low price with solid financials and a bright future. 
Sold my amzn calls too soon as always. Oh well.
Buy Tesla at eod after it dumps

Looking for opinions on my portfolio. 

Total value: 203k.

26% VTSAX

24.56% generic sp500 index in 401k

17.61% AMZN

9.33% MSFT

7.38% AAPL

4.32% GOOG

2.97% FB

2.95% cash (going to be FSKAX on Jan 1, just waiting for 2021 Roth to be available)

1.63% TDOC

1.1% FSKAX (Fidelity's "vtsax")

.6% RKT

.44% SE

So prior to this year I was 100% vtsax set and forget. However in June as everything began recovering, I decided to take 1/2 my portfolio and get in on some of the big names. With my luck, and a few bad decisions sp500 has outperformed this mix pretty handily. 

Admittedly I FOMO'd but am planning on either dumping them all and going back to 100% index or just holding it all long term. 

So what's everyone's thoughts on my FAGMA going forward? 

I bought them all late June. 

Also all my contributions since then have been to indexes. 

Any advice or opinions are appreciated!

Edit: goal is to retire in 21 years. Using a 5% avg return including inflation.
Just YOLO'd into PLTR

cant wait till the PLTR contact tracers drag me out my house in February for supporting Trump. !!  :D
CRSR gang. Move your profits into GME.

This is not financial advice (do it anyways)

You invest in scams with no sales or revenue, you get what you deserve
GOODBYE PLTR
JUST SELL AND TAKE YOUR PROFITS YOULL THANK ME LATER
Sell all your PLTR by today! I want to get in at 20.
Red Alert: just because things are mooning does not mean you should not be holding SPY puts

this bitch gonna tank any minute/day now. Make your money on short term gains in these EV plays, but also be very ready to make a killing on the downside too. No problem with making money on both sides!! its actually something to be proud of

Are we taking profit on pltr then getting back in later?
Damn I thought we hit the bottom before I bought back in. Guess we're going down one more time.
SUMO!
Could use some bounce action
Sonos dumping

This is like the first red day for CRSR since the day they IPO'd.

It barely dropped to Monday's closing price 
Its time for CCL and UAL to die. You've had your fun dammit
Auntie Jumia and uncle Palantir are carrying my entire portfolio today lol
pump SPY to 370 today
I hate MRNA. It's such bullshit that other companies are getting the pass on the downturn for the next few years but MRNA goes up on what will be a financially meaningless (in the long run) effort. Nothing in this marmet makes sense.
I had big profit yesterday and watched it evaporate through close. Now Im seeing a tiny profit (less than $15), should I book it or let it ride? One of my biggest positions
SPY pulling back lets go
If I decide to get robinhood gold (30 days free trial) should turn on margin or continue without it?
That Magnite DD the other day has been delicious. Absolutely CHILLING rn, yall have fun with PLTR
Its still not included in the s&p they havent started buying shares yet. So its not the top, its just a bullshit day where 10000 recalls is some how significant

Imagine not taking profits with extreme greed at 91 after a parabolic rally
Is Spy gonna be red Friday too?
Guys, I know this might be frown upon in here. But I call for all of us to sell off at the same time to get those MMs. They pulled the rugs on us last time in September when the fear/index was above 90 and the calls/puts ratio was at 70%
Whew! Got out if my NIO credit spreads at a small loss. Never be short meme stocks.

How do I turn a call I own, into a debit spread?

I tried to simply sell a call, but it won't let me because it's not recognizing the call I own as collateral.

Don't ask. I'm retarded.

Nio 51c and 52c exp this Friday, should I try to sell them before eod today or wait till Friday morning?
late to pltr?
Maybe the wrong place to ask since we're all retards here, but if your option is ITM on the day of expiry, does the decrease in Theta have an effect on the actual value of your option? Or just the intrinsic value?

i.e. does your option moon on the day of expiration if you're in the money?
Pltr hold until 4 pm, might see dip after hours/tomorrrow
When to sell pltr  how high we Goin boys
Just picked up 11/27 30C for a hundred each... 30 EOD!!! Lets gooooooo

Lets go booooys
Almost $30! Here we go 
Dear Santa, I've been nice. Deliver me $300 BABA, $15 GME and $0 CCL asap. Later I want NOK as high as you dare to make it.
how exactly? Im serious. I want in
Feels Im chasing if I buy @ $25
PLTR!

I hear that F is fucking crazy volatile
You must have just learned about stocks. A stock moving 10-20% per day is really unheard of. This year the stock market has been moving strangely. If it were so easy to make money everyone in here would be a millionare.
Stonks go up. RKT stays flat or goes down
Decent company, worst ticker
Wish someone told me RKT would have more trouble getting off the ground than the Challenger flight
Such a disappointment
sold my RKT at a loss and bought PLTR leaps a few days back. made back my loss and then some in a single afternoon.
Should get a pump from home sales today, but market may dump today
Thats cause they didnt get in until it was already up 198 percent
leverage used is leverage gained.  Until you loose that leverage....
Yeah but this time it's different.  This is a breakfast drop son.
Its called Black Friday for a reason. Its on sale. Duh
this, peoples assholes aren't used to the red colour dildos yet.
Whats the stock at after hours rn?
it's a damn tragedy... market must be crashing, the bubble has popped... ships going down
Lmao
So many things you want me to do 
What is unexpected price action compared to what is seen daily?
So just yolos all day? Got it
Invested yesterday into meme stock and its barely green, some slightly red. This is not what I signed up for.
Palantirs general manager Peter Thiel proudly waited outside the Wall Street trading floor after the final bell to give Alex Karp and the FDSEs on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Friday afternoon. Cucked gay bear Andrew Left yelled out, There you go! There you go. Money printer Jerome Powell gave a look of pleasant surprise. An army of autists screeched out, We got an [expletive] squad now. And before Peter hit the rocket ships door, former Wall Street great Trevor Milton hugged him and said, Yall look so different.
These are going to be low volume days. All the traders are on vacation.
I yes I was waiting for this 
### Double digit red in the EV Chinese makers.
Brought a PLTR $20 call expiring Friday because it was the only one I can afford. Hold till then or sell today?
Is there anything weird with how options expiring this Friday will be treated? Should I plan to get out of 11/27 spreads today or let the theta accumulate and get out Friday?
> expect unexpected price action

Ohh yeahh sorry, forgot this week was totally normal
 we need to start spamming cramers twitter with gain porn.
Most retarded thing he's ever said
Is this the new name for the WSB effect. Retard strong
When do we jump off the train?
May as well be a bullseye
Those tattoos are hot
 wasn't this Bill Cosby's legal defense strategy?
Women want sex more than men. Most men just arent any good at it, so they dont get it thrown at them.

Forget put out signs. Look for cook, clean, and give you money signs.
Give them a nice thanksgiving SPAM
They never expected one.
Ramen better anyways
He is an autistic boomer
market goes STRAIGHT up for a solid week and some change

tards buy in yesterday at the absolute top

why stonk go down when wsb said stonk only go up?
For real tho
Me too brah. Hang in there.
Right?  Their true colors are shining bright.
Facts
We aren't average, my wife's boyfriend says I'm special
Holding 12/4 $20 so unless this really tanks, holding will be ez
Jan15 28C printing nicely now!
Yes, I will be selling some Covered Calls on my shares. Gay Theta Gang stuff
China is your issue 
Habib, there will always be another opportunity.  I'm down a few myself.  If you need to, step back dump into shares a little. They'll be more opportunities.
Don't. If I held on to all my position about this time last year, I would have been million dollar richer. But who knew. 

Hindsight is 20/20
Same, its all I've seen. luckily i haven't lost a bunch but I've convinced myself not to FOMO in this whole time

Sucks when your down $5k before your morning shit
BABA?
Lol got some 11/27 i feel you
Big Brain move

Did the same with SBE.
If it makes you feel better there's a user who bought 500 xpev 100c 1/15/21. Pretty confident it'll go up
I've been there a few times.
What if jobless claims are higher than expected again?
GDP more important
Rip in peace
Thank u for ur donation
Its okay retard, these things happen. Learn from them and youll get out of this
Luckily I only bought one, but rip man
why???

There wasn't even a glance of it pumping

Actually it dropped and was almost flat during the day, but still at the top.
If they are 12/4 you're fine. If not sorry 
How was stern
Got a prestigious business degree from top university in Europe to buy into pnd T H ... B stonks
Yeah and definitely don't buy TSLA either, I'm only up by 800% :(
Im down over 2k on pltr shares
That feels pretty accurate tbh
Is that not exactly what traders do?
Puts. 
Youre done bud
Please tell me you didn't check wsb using a company phone or computer?
Start editing your resume
You're not fucked, but you're also not...not fucked.
Is it a large or small company? If its large then youre more than likely fine. If small, you better start looking or doing something to keep your position.
o shit.
Yeeeehaw!!
I thought they were peanuts
Imagine owning PLTR stock and believing in personal privacy, lol.

I have no principles.
Imagine caring. Stock goes brrrrrr
Tell her boyfriend I'm happy for you
Its cute that youre assuming shell say yes
remember to get spayed and neutered, you two~
Congrats.
Congrats! Hope she says yes.
Thoughts on dropping a 100k on NIO shares and letting it brew for 10 years?
Finally someone with common sense
Congrats and fuck you
Congrats. Try really hard not to fuck it
Fuck you man I hate you(r success)
Fuck you autistic retard! Gongrats
its gonna happen sooooo much

then rug pull next week and the family members will be pissed off at each other
lol
Got in CRSR at 49.00
Some guy has got 1400 shares on tap to buy if it hits 541...wtf. How?

29 by now  
If there are 2 green weeks, and 1 red day and you'll never recover, you're not built for this.
literally
Pressure breaks pipes, but pressure also makes diamonds
It's very strong of them indeed to have that willpower when we all know it's gonna keep dropping
If they're holding this week's expo their madmen. Closed tmmrw half day Friday theta gonna fuck em
100% buying the dip today
I would only do this if you're ready to suffer from success, and have your family beg you for hand outs.
Same
Ditto. Took profits from Jan calls and now waiting to reentry

Drag em sis
Still here.
I was told there is a $10 floor? No need to even check the price until it moons.
being thicc gets you banned now
STILL HERE AND FUCKING STROnGGGGGKKK
bought shares at 11.5 ama
Cia will you know what in your sleep.
Well thats what It stands for isnt it?
The future is now old man
OhHHHHH my GoDDS GeT OUt WhILe YoU CAn!!!!!
My only regret is I cant buy more
Does WMT have a musky boi tho
Do you not understand that the bigger the market cap on December 21 the more shares funds are going to have to buy.  Traders are literally squeezing index fund at this point
this is wsb, if the meme stock is not moving up 25% daily, ppl get bearish.
Who are you, that is so scholarly in the old ways of our ancient history?
there is a reason we get to see so many losses on this sub. People just throw money around or pull money out on overreatctions left and right.
Math checks out.
Looks like someone took Econ
Solid DD
Fr people going nuts
Thats because we all FOMOd in at 24...it was a strategic play, but high, sell low
doesn't matter cause most of WSB bought in at the top?

KNDI dropping like a brick tied to my feet in a lake.
You just read my mind. I'm going all in on PLTR at open
Yus
Fucking yep
Pls daddy.
stage -- denial
This is the way
Definitely.  I still don't know what they make,  but I'll buy one for me and one for my dog.
I already have one, drives so smooth
but it's the fun kind

not the bear kind
Gayboy
Tuscan raiders I like that
This is catchy. I just want hear something Tuscan sounds once the market goes down a bit
I'm trying to buy into more shares. What's the opinion... do it immediately at open or like yesterday do we think there will be a little drop before we moon so I should wait a little ?
I will take it
Yessir lets hope so
Just grabbed some Tuscan this am
I'm all in for this, Raiders move out!
Is the EV pull back already over? Was that it?
I'm thinking the EV insane rally is over but if not this will be the case
Try almost a $1 but it won't really matter unless you have FDs
God I wish I had that kind of cash.
I'm only in for 1k worth of shares but I might double that if there's another dip
Confirmed
Im buying more  as well
I've been waiting for a dip so I can get back in. Took profits at $20 and been regretting it for 2 days.
Lmao some homies got 36k shares queued if it drops to $21 theres the absolute bottom 
For real. Best of luck brother
The casino always wins
Still got an hour till open my dude. Pace yourself
Eh, it's just a lil pullback for the holiday weekend. If you're that worried and have weeklies, roll them out to next Friday and alls well.
it dipped 20 cents im so confused
If you love it so much maybe you should marry it!
The thing has rare momentum. Rarely have these types of opportunity
You mean 30
Yeah so he spends all day downvoting instead of making moves or his own research lmao loser amirite
the scam bag holders is my guess (or the bots that were pushing it)

They are like "I will get my revenge! -1 -1 -1 -1"

Sir.... are you aware its a federal crime to file a false report?
It was a dark time indeed, glad I held.
every day a +10% day for the rest of the year because why not
PLTR gets green periods
Lol
Itll eventually not work like everything but like cmon man odds are in your favour
Still some time left. There are a few dips here and there before the next 3% jump
Is there still time to get in this. I just got killed in corsair
PLTR FTW
Seriously, this sub is so panicky
Its probably mostly people that either arent even holding positions, or people that bought in yesterday that exp eow.
I like THC-B better anyway
Some grandfathered rule about pumping penny stocks
Small market cap. More susceptible to pump and dump
Mods are just scared of the incredible potential.
Wait what since when? Fuck the mods
Free market!!!
I have the deepest wrinkles
Yeah u shld be too
my portfolio is all in on long dated calls and shares
I did, and still do.  Wish I sold my calls yesterday for profit and re-entered today.
THANK YOU!
God? Is that you??
Yes because you are one of us, a fellow retard
Easy
Pick something that is undervalued instead.
you'll end up holding everyone's panic sell bags. Might be a good thing, might be a bad thing.
What do they do?
they have a market cap of 35 billion and revenue of 500 million...
This is the way! Switched to PLTR from NIO after taking profits at the top!
The ones with cushions though. We arent savages
Theyre autistic... what do you expect
Is it too late to get in?
Please, my mom makes that in a hour lying naked in bed
Thank you king. I make more fucking off in bed than I do through the army lol
28? Nah. 30? Ohhh yeahhh
maybe consider slightly rebalancing
Congrats fuckboy
Palantards
>MFW I want to buy the PLTR dip but it won't dip.

The dip is anytime before 30
it already dipped fam
Now
Same, neeed that same dip as yesterday
Just buy now. I was scared to buy at 22 but I did it anyway and look how thats turned out.
Dont wait or youll be waiting forever
I thought I bought at the top yesterday ATH. Turned out i was completely wrong
Where we thinking PLTR is headed to?
U couldve bought a 28C an hour ago for 90. I got one but didnt not expect to make that already
Put it in shares of Pltr
Yeah I feel ya. Luckily I already have a date set for when Im going to buy calls on $ROPE. 21st bday :)/
In 3 hours
Not little for weekly holders lol.
Tis but a scratch
I'm starting a new gaming platform for bears. Rocucks.
It will definitely recover today.
God bless I believe in CRSR more than I believe in myself loading up at open and hoping that we reach orbit
13 mill purchased in puts yesterday
same
It will be down 5% eod. By December theyll be $10-15 higher than today
Try again. The stocks are down 10%. The calls will be a bloodbath.
So next week?
He saw lil yachty drops tmmrw
This is WSB so absolutely.
Lmao gg
Same. Gonna be doubling down on PLTR if it opens low like its looking. Also sold out of NIO entirely now, at a nice profit.
Hell no
Never does.
Some mornings be like that
I know imagine thinking it would go down on a pUlLbAcK dAy
 and 
50 by then
Riding this rocket on $31c 11/27
Probably a smart move, around 43-44
the is the wae
Yes
I've been holding 100 shares and lots of 03/21 $20 calls.

Up 40k rn
Wish I was that sick fuck, bought in at 13.9, sold off around 14.9, bought back in with all my account at 16.60 and holding til 60 at least.
Its me, Im a sick fuck
I'm wondering the same thing. I did $26 covered calls this week when it was $19 and already had a fantastic runnup. I didn't think there was any way it would make it there by friday. I'm probably losing my shares now lol. Oh well. Still good profit on it :)
i'm saying... i thought no way PLTR could rip 10% + all week right? turns out its a meme.
Cramer is shaking his fist at you right now
I'm upset I blew up my account in May. I could've crushed some more pltr right now
Same
No regrets, all in to the fucking moon
All organic baby
lol fr but it should be 100b by feb imo, we're gunna see some volatility but id hold if u got shares
The coke and drink ruined him.
Had never heard of him. Googled. Dude looks like he was a badass, goddamn tank on the field. RIP
when van halen died it took me back. was a legend
life is short, never more clear than this year. enjoy spending the tendies from your YOLOs because you never know how much time is left.
Im sitting Bitch with 84 shares! Wheres the stewardess with my damn drink?
Had me in the first half ngl
Very cool
u dont want to see the moon?
Makes it taste a little sweeter
after a year of trading I think PLTR is the first one that I nailed, feels so good lol
Calls? Take profit, roll some up n out
But its fun while it lasts. If shares then you got no worries
That good?
Your mum is retarded.
That is apple market cap level bruv
THATS A LITTLE CRAZY OF A SPLIT BRO. MAYBE 1:5
Best problem to have
haha you bastard XD good on ya
hold forever, this thing could hit 100 by next year at this rate
Be strong brother; I YOLOed my life savings in PLTR stocks now I dont know what to do. Its raising too fast for my brain to compute
Just hold brother.
I believe they call that free money, yes.
It. Just. Works.
Worth
10k is 10k tho.
lmaooo
If contract ends Friday then yeah I'm a bear I guess.
I joined today and am already up a few hundred %. Wish I jumped on sooner but gains are gains
I don't have to imagine.
The fomo would eat me from within
buy when Cramer fearful

sell when Cramer says buy
Bold of you to assume I wear panties.
u/optionsandtren you heard the man!
Bloody dicks out for Elonbre

dude i already came 3 times
Cramer said oil stonks were uninvestable. Now he pumps Chevron daily. He said not to buy at the March bottom, and he gave the all clear and said to go all in at June high. You do the math.
Because they FOMOed in yesterday at 2PM with weeklies
My dude, those gains were because people bought anticipating 20%+ gains themselves.
Same
He bought?
IN THE PLTR, PART OF THE PLTR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PZE6NmN5KA
yes, its my favorite child
All i can say is s
And never letting go again of this stock. Just trust your feeling.
Hold strong. We have absolutely no reason to doubt PLTR..
why would u sell..its going to be over $100 soon
If that shit happens i'll jerk off a horse.
God speed
ITS DROPPING KEEP PHMPKGN BIHCO
hahahahaahhahahahaha proof or ban
At least you hung onto that last 2%...
IM SORRY
ask you anything
Damn :(
that's why you are a subscriber here
Why even sell?
It's the greasy fat kid on a treadmill, chasing a hot dog. It won't stop until it's satisfied
It's gonna go to $30 so you wanna keep watching?
I'm at 6x on LEAPS that I bought a month ago.

If they were monthlies I'd be a millionaire.
3x only? My spy calls were 5x from mon to tues lol
 
exp?
Shares or calls?
Thanks for your service 
What an odd definition of dip.
THRU THE FUCKING ROOF,NEXT DESTINATION ANDROMEDA GALAXY 
Yep.
yes
2 hours
easily. y'all need to stop taking profits and ride
IMO that's a stretch but EOW is very possible
Please no
yes
maybe now but not in 2 months
No. Thank you for helping our calls :)
It will be $100 by next earning
Eh maybe like a tad but have u seen the stonk lately
\*Your wife's bf's parking ticket
Literally did this over the course of the day. Granted only 1k
yes
George hasnt even sold all his shares yet. He loves it
My 12/18 30c are already printing so fucking hard. Selling 80% of my calls when it becomes a 5 bagger this afternoon.
You mean EOD?
I sold my calls earlier today for nearly 100% profit. Could have had like 250% if I held till now, but I took profit and went and bought a 3080 with it. I know I made the right decision cause I've lost a shitload of money by holding too long, and the market always has new opportunities. I'm happy for those that held it though
hope thats true Thats awesome
IM NOT FUCKING SELLING
Not so retarded after all
Thats awesome! Glad this year is rounding out wellhope you score some good dips
congrats bro. what field?
Congrats! Smart lad!
Congratulations
Congrats!!
Congratulations retard
Let Biden pay for your student loans
Puts on thanks goddam giving
Heavy drinking is in your future for the next 2 days it sounds like
fuckin pisser bud, hang in there
If they hit $30, Ill spread crispy tendies among all degenerates
You bought calls? Then you can jerk off to them
Nice
Dont act like you have a social life
way to avoid that 99.98 percent chance to live
DONT Sell.
I literally want pltr to be red just so I can buy more
I aint touching PLTR or CIIC. Bullish long term, in three-five years I believe they will show tremendous growth. Ive got other stocks for trading. Not those
Happened to me twice in a week

Pfizer then Moderna. All my plays dumped
I saw this in a tweet.  Data dump of what?
He jinxed it
What's he doing now
He fucks it all up
this is basically what got TSLA from 100 to 300 pre split
Its a shakedown on the RH crowd
So those of us on real brokerages can sneak in some cheap shares before the commoners get access.
Probably because some dyed in the wool daytraders needed an excuse to do something before anyone else and the big boys got tired of hearing it so they get to play trader with low volume before open so we dont need to hear anymore bitching about it
For the cucks who want to see their beloveds fucked.
Investors like to trade in the **pre**\-**market** session for the same reason they like to trade in the **after-hours** trading sessionthey want to **get** a leg up on the competition by reacting quickly to news announcements that occur when the regular **market is** closed.
IM. NOT. FUCKING. SELLING.  Ill go BROKE BEFORE I SELL
I'm fucking, not selling
what price??
Do your part and buy the dip
Always has been
Lmfao.
Ever seen Le Voyage dans la Lune? Theyve been saying this 
>Hoh hon hon. Oui Oui. Baguette. PLTR  la lune

google wasn't able to help me on this one...
Puts are cheap AF for this.
People are because I'm selling them. Made a ton already
lmao I fuckin could have bought in at 23.50 this owning but waiting for a dip and I just bought in at 25.71. enough fucking around.
#THEY NEVER LOSE!!! - Jim Cramer
Good question
Predictable, possible, probable?
Next week you mean.
Per share? Are you high?
I sold 29 calls against my monthly 25 calls.

Literally free money with the holiday and short day on Fri.
i have 34 12/4 i dont know how this works but im up 50% this morning
Hey, I bought those from you. Thank you for your sacrifice!
Emotional trading is so beautiful. The ups ,the downs, the autism... The 9:30am sound of "Guh" being muttered by millennials who bought 0.05 delta 1DTE calls on a meme stock after a 200% run up. It truly is breathtaking.
Im the people now
lolllll
Keep going Im close
Same I got the feeling it'll be 30 sooner than we think
Because you have a brain
Waiting for $1500 to clear :(
Buy a few PLTR stocks.
Longer you wait the more expensive itll be
Join us
Would be good with EOY
that guy who mentioned MGNI really fucks
Market makers finally gave the fuck up
made months pay in literally 30 mins . This is gucking crazy
We are all entrepreneurs here
I set my alarm
Poors hate money
Narrator voice:  It did matter.
You just think MMs are going to let everyones calls go ITM? There are 70% more calls than puts out there. They cant afford to let everything keep pumping
This is true actually
PLTR is bulletproof
Best decision youve made
There is no top
Hah. 

This guy thinks theres a top.
This is near the bottom-enjoy!
Lmao imagining not buying enough at 9
Imagine accidentally selling 300 shares you bought at $11 at $17 trying to set a stop loss
Ouch
This is the way
I feel that
Actually the smart move it seems
I dropped a whole $100 as a meme at 14.

Fucks sake.
I put in 50% of my portfolio in at 19, and it's literally more than doubled my investment account.
$40 by close Friday
I mean, you already made r/investing annual returns target, what more can you want
This is the way.
Ban
Are you also a registered Independent?
lol sell?
Same, took 2x profit and lost out on 6x
you might want to cash in and call it a day!
Sometimes FOMO pays off!

Preach
Fuck you. But good job
This is what we need more of. With Great power comes great responsibility
bless you
:)
This dudes almost as good as that monkey bag-o-sticks!

Tendie rhymes better with healthy my dude
Those that have been around remember how fucking off he was back in 2008.  He shouldve been banned from tv since then.
your own fault for watching Cramer lmao.
I did what he said, bought NKLA, and made 100%. Sold yesterday at lunch. Perspective
So sell and buy back lower or just  ?
It'll level out and go back to rally mode by 10. Pre market and the first half hour mean nothing.
drill
That shit doesnt work. You need weed
Correct
Ik shorting tbh
There is no more positive news, so I wouldn't be looking to buy anything just yet.
Screw it I'm in.
RIP
Your Friday self will thank you.
Yah yeet yahhhh
Yeet
Theta gang here. Made close to 5k this week thanks to the retards gobbling up any fds I write them.
My family hates me. Fuck it
You gonna play the c3.ai IPO?
I really wish I woke up at market open instead of 10 minutes ago. Seeing it down 4% just took 10 years off my life expectancy. If I woke up later I wouldn't have even known that happened
Thinking of dumping my current shares for gains then buying at the dip, today isn't feeling too good ngl
[deleted]
Soros was the news, and the upgrade
An analyst downgraded it tho
I bought in ATH yesterday and am down 2k. I averaged down with 200 more shares but Im still fuk BUT IM NOT SELLING 
26
I'll play, 27
Time to sell NIO and take some profits to be safe
diamond hands get rewarded  
just double down
You think this is the crash? Go ahead and paperhand it then.
It will print trust
Who cares lmao
That's probably going to hit
Lol wtf
I was smart and did $23c.
You still might be the retard yet bud
Im holding till I die
Did the same thing... hoping for a second dip before I buy back in.

And if it doesnt dip? Profit is profit
Dont be a dumbass like me who sold PLTR covered calls. Now Im missing out on 2k profits fuck!
If your erection lasts more than four hours, seek medical attention.
Lets fuckin gooooooo
HON is the one boomer stock imma be holding onto for the long game
Yeah, lmfao at getting 20k in $1 stock options for 10 years to only sell that for just shy of 2 million. What retards, lmao.
Proud of you bro
Glad to hear you made it out! Be careful with those YOLOs and be patient as you stack gains.
And tiny
I guess he wasnt there
calls on $SQ
I'd take a triangular head for half his $$
Calls at open had me clenching all morning but here we goooo
Thought exactly this last night. I think WSB underestimates its influence on certain meme equities
Because it's illegal. Don't say it out loud. Some of these picks have low floats, or high numbers of shorts. Just let them get memed naturally and contribute.
Ah. Thats called market manipulation and is somewhat frowned upon
Hahahahah. Glad I have PLTR & NIO
I dont get this joke.
Thiel probably could destroy Citron, Gawker style if he wanted to lol
Cramer gonna be so mad.
FUCKING WHOOOOOOORE. SOME BBBBSSSS
chill it will retest
That seemed to work.
Sitting at my desk with a customer in front of me signing paper work for their Porsche! LETS GOOOOO
To the mooooon
I was jerking off to my 17.5c 01/21/22 bought at $2.35. It's 5 bagger already
Been feeling like this since 12 dollars ago and it never gets old.
In bed doin the same lololol
You also get Anal Trip
Tesla, nio, pltr. We are monogamist retards
 clown fiesta

PLTR fds printed this morn vale poppin been in that for months just switched to eow spy calls
#
I have never made this much money before
seriously some of these contracts like 19, 20, and 21c were cheap as fuck on monday.

given the volume on the 20c on monday some ppl should be doing very well right now
HAHAHA
Why havent you already
Fuck yes

Yes. $40 EONW
You sons of multiple bitches Im in

Hell no I'm not selling

My kids are gonna be like "we don't have to work because Dad invested in some peanut company that spies on people"

Just stroke one out in the bathroom
They are so tiny and short-lived its impossible to catch
holding PLTR is big PP move
Youve been noticed
RemindMe! 1 year

PLTR is gonna crash hard

INTO THE MOON
I am! Bought this morning too. I have 12/18 and 1/21 30c, up 57% and 71%
Holding 21C for 12/11 I bought last week thats up 550% because why not
WE RUN THIS
Same brother, I have no idea what PLTR does.
YEEEE
Ok baby
Thank you
I bought this morning at like 1 hour past open and Im up 200%
lol at the salty bitch who downvoted you
i bought shares there because im big brain. +29% today
Yeah some dude was giving me shit for it, I hope he Stubbs his toe.
This time is different lol.
Works until it doesn't. Patterns don't stay the same
Except it has been memed to fuck and back
Plz esplain I just yolo'd $1000
Specially with the rant Reddit got from Jim Cramer yesterday. POS
#
This is a serious buying opportunity for those who have been waiting.
Their data gets sold each day to the real robinhood robber barons.
Because we cant trade futures
They trick the algos into buying
People on here sleep?
Thats fuckedddd
They're just mad they weren't starting their investing lives during a historical energy revolution. Let them have their contempt and jealousy, we'll have tendies.
I'll be buying the scheduled 9:45 AM dip
haha retards
I mean it's still red so I feel like they probably aight
im gonna need a LOT more 14% days for that to happen to me
That way you are a balanced retard.
Imagine thinking 18 dollar was too high
Let us know next time they make a plane that falls out the sky. Thanks.
You gonna be a test passenger for the 747 test flight?
F
get LEAPs
Pls pls pls
Sold a bunch of 260c and 272.5c end of day for huge profits probably gonn pick up some more 272.5 12/24
Ill take a flat day even
You can thank me now
Show your gratitude and offer your holes as tribute
Doubt it. CCP loves NIO and are heavily invested in them being able to compete with TSLA. Similar with XPEV, neither are going in incur wrath from CCP for forseeable future.

If you want free money
Why not all 13k? It's a sure thing
Might as well light it on fire
Ok lets see trades in 2 hours
It can't even stay below 23. It's basically free below that price.
cope
The Meme ETF.  Sounds like a plan.
lol
What are they now?
But without the sellers we wouldnt have dips to buy.... so maybe the gay bears were inside us all along
If you are going to panic, panic early
I am and Im going to sell my calls too
Keep ya head up king
I remember that. Does this mean I am not getting a thread ripper either?
What'd they say
What did they say
I just want him to change his gender once while in office
nah priced that one in a decade ago
Guess when it's getting low today?
PLTR is a 5 year hold play
Always
For a red day
You fucked up
30!!!
Insane amounts of euphoria and FOMO. I've been playing calls but I see this for what it is. A P&D.
People buy call options.  Market makers buy shares to delta hedge their short option positions.  stock goes up.  Rinse and repeat.
100\*
Yessir the purpose is to make money, not pennies
100
60 by Xmas
200 by 2022
40 end of January is my honest to god prediction
$110
I though my 300% was good lol
Daddy Biden will no worries

Not yet lol why
Sold at the top but deadass might wait till EOD or Friday to get back in...I dont see the market makers letting it run like this for like 3 weeks straight and people might wanna take profits for the holidays
90% of the smart ones have them already
I want to believe.
not this week.
Itll bounce back by lunch, trail off eod, Friday it will hit $29.50. My friends mechanic said so.

Its only a loss when you panic sell low and fomo buy high.
Positions?
Its definitely tempting ill give you that
Keep buying till youre out of money
Hard to catch the absolute bottom, just know it will go up after it goes down a bit more
Loss or gain?
My account has teased 60k a few times the last week. Think it'd be there if TGT hadn't traded wonky yesterday.

Nice shit -- hope you march on to 100k in no time....unless part of it is shorting TGT lol.
congrats! plays?
You sir, enjoy 50% by jan
Thanks for the heads up.  I'm out.

Mary Antoinette shouldve slept with her husband earlier.
Man fuck the government they are all crooks and they only fucking cares about themselves
Google:  "A fat sack of blow, two hookers, and a Lamborghini.  Is there anything else I can help you with today Michael?"
Ill nut.
Award.
Yarp

Der wei was schmeckt
Gonna need a 50c before long.
Roll them further OTM. Gotta squeeze as many tendies out of this gravy train as possible
Welcome, this is a safe space
Sell when its worth $1000
Youre in bro!
40
Sell puts.

Just buy a PLTR cap instead
Remind me! One day
Ill get it on my dick if it hits 32 before next Wednesday
lol i keep taking profits too early... lol buy in morning... sell near eod... god damn I need to hold for those gap ups
I fd that up 3 times already, made a little instead of a lot
Same bruh I doubled my portfolio today but if I click all Im still down lmfao
At some point that really is making money lmfao. Not like you would have got it back any other way
We dont deal with organic here, we use hormones and steroids to grow our chickens(tendies)
>
Yes
i sold more than half at 55% up, a house purchase is within my grasp i had to do it x_x

if i didn't sell i'd be up almost 95% now :( 

moral: DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS
Probably right
like wtf
i doubt he sold all his stake
He's been holding those since 2012, and I dont think he just dumped all of his shares at once.

Hes probably selling as the price goes up right now.
84 mid December :)

LOTS of happy WSBers
I have a $30 call and it looks like Im holding
selling my today after power hour and rolling it out for $35c 12/4

hold together now
I just exhaled through nose, etc.
Yeahhhhh boiiiiii 
Whats the tdlr on this
Whoever downvoted this needs to be perma-banned
So buy 0tde 365c?
Because Nasdaq is about to rip
you love to see it lol
Ha, I also sold covered calls for December thinking even if it goes up past the strike+premium, it won't be much.

I didn't know how wrong I could be.
Me too. And even if I won more I wouldnt cash it out. Its not like I need the money and unless I suddenly win hundreds of k, I cant change my lifestyle radically.
I feel this.
That sucks
Gains are gains
Money is money you sexy retard. Never be sad making ching
ME. TOO. 
Doing god's work
Why not options?
LET'S GO! ZEHAHAHA
Lets go to $20?
Never doubt Trump's ability to fuck everything up
Agree. That clown always jinx it. Remember his tweets in early September? Bloodbath
A sacred number
Yup, when has it not dumped after Donnie has bragged of ATHs?
That meme already died after it failed last time
Can't fucking wait for the next timeline to start.
its -0.05% dude stfu.
We get it you hate trump

Edit: ooh we didnt know I was on very unbiased r/politics
Drama queen
Im a mannnn
Yellow*
the sub now is literally a bunch of teenage bitches
Everyone is levered to the tits on EV meme stocks, all of which are down 10% across the board.
Their weeklies are fucked with anything less than 10% a day
All their money is in China. Tards
Thats basically the entire financial system right now. If its not getting a steady pump of fake and  gains it all goes to hell
This slim been sucking for 2 weeks straight. Got that Dyson vacuum grip.
PLTR a freak bro
it's just getting started.
The algos heard them
The big funds didn't like that
Again? 
Dont make promises you cant keep
This is the way
soon you'll have 2k in both your RH account and your bank acct
one simple trick
no risk. no reward.
Everything at ATH but I'm sitting here with these Apple bags
MMs needed to pull out some cash to buy all of their employees turkeys for Thanksgiving.
what's a meme?
Hopefully by close worst case
From what?
Its recovering fast, dont worry
by EOD you'll probably get a soda and sundae to go with it!
Fuck yes man, we havent even begun to understand how rigged this shit is
Sorry, dude
Just dont check your robinhood today
Theyre gonna print something
i can't read, so is good or bad?
even with the dump, if you got in early you are still up bigly
Lets hope so. More importantly, LI. A drop of 13% 
Why u think so
My girl always wants me to just stick it in her when shes still sleeping but it just feels too rapey for me
So.... wanked on your sisters tits?

Dont marry her if you like the quickies.
how, where
it be the american dream
Take profits
Palantir is America
I miss read doubled. And I was like I have 6x my money wym microwave it?
big^swinging^dicks
PLTR with the massive big dick energy over here 
Liar
My parent in laws just pulled everything out of the market. They took a fat hit in March and finally recovered it all. 

They are gonna let things normalize a bit before putting everything back in. 

Such a massive disconnect right now.
I thought fear index was extreme greed last i checked
This means the crash is coming, bout time. We're going to run out of suckers.
Im 50 and I have seen this before. Its 2001 and this shit has me shakin. Im with whomever just posted to take the winnings and chill for the holidays. Every idiot on the street has a pick, Cramer is spewing nonsense, PEs are impossible and this place is flooded with pumpers and wannabes. Its the dotcom bomb and Yahoo finance message boards. F if I know anything. Good luck!
>Even people in my real life have downloaded robinhood and dumped their life savings into the top. 

I am getting deja vu from September. I can't get myself to pull the plug tho.
Confirmed ?
That's my favorite thing it do
I think its Bears getting fucked right left and centre! LMFAO

Fuck the Bears!

Wish I couldve bought more than 300 shares...If only I hadnt lost everything trading options during March/April :(
That guy took hookers and blow to another level. The cocaine market will never recover from this.
wsb is now my primary source of news
oh my fucking god bro

i just cringed IRL
Where would you rank this stock
Pretty much.
Dead? This is the work of god
I just hoped on the train with 700 of the 4000 Im investing.

the greatest to ever do it
Leverage has entered the chat
Me too thanks
Bro youre atleast going to make 13$ per share. Its going to 40 by end of year.
I fomod to, sucks now it should drop for those wanting a better entry
You mean ?
Give us a clue home slime 
Thats how to do it!! My stop loss triggered this morning on CRSR went all in on the stock that shall not be named and rest in pltr
yo for real, 8 hour work day, 1 hour lunch, 1-2 hours work, 5-6 hours on wsb and staring at random graphs lol
lmfao same though. Work from home has become a blessing and a curse (for the company, I'm doing fine )
Mine will be TSLA    
What strike/exp
Im holding at least til it stops going up 15% per day
Hold. Do you think PLTR will never hit $27 again? Cmon
Yes
same
"Never went in on my wife but I'm glad to watch other dudes enjoying her"
-> $12
Teach me your ways
How??
Were gonna break $30 before lunch
Top isnt coming this year
F
bruhh
yes lol
Your mistake is thinking of PLTR as a trendy meme EV stock etc. Get out of that mindset and you would have been in it since IPO.
I might tbh
Yes
how dare u consider selling.

how. dare. u!!
I did. And I bought at 9.54. Only 100 shares tho
Well considering I made 3.3X return on ciic in a week, I don't sweat it.
Me!
I bought a fuck ton of shares when it IPOed. It went down to 9 for a bit and I ended up selling:(
Hopefully but then Ill be marked on RH :(
Going 12 rounds in this bitch
Everyone's now back from the 3-martini lunch and ready to drunk-trade.
Pics or ban
Congrats 
What car?
90% sure of it going $29 EOD
I DARE YOU
Dawg its happening
Another 1.70 please
My nipples have been rock hard since the market opened monday..thank you pltr
Important
So i should i sell this jan $25 call?
Not if you buy far itm options ;)
Its called MOON
i said that yesterday!
MOON
I'll make it don't worry
Check into $MOON. If I recall they actually are holding PLTR, NIO, BLNK, etc right now.
Look at the other calls in your portfolio thats why
Will break it by 2:00
it's gonna hit 30 at the end of the hour
DO IT BRO!
50$ sonnnnnnnnn lets goooooooo 
I would watch for the luls
Where can I see this?
What is it
Mods!!!!
Send me video please
Can I have one?
Actually true
you mean buy shares, you know that is whats pushing the shares up right
Up 300% in one year
On it
Chewy 69c
That's because soceity is capitalism and the puppy, well, the puppy is just a puppy
Its called marketing
why support china instead of PLTR  who has signed contracts to destroy it. haha
This is the way.
Because the retards on this sub buy shit like $30 calls expiring Friday so if it doesnt pump 10% everyday they lose money.

Edit: welp
Gratz dude
Congrats, hope you have happy life
Let's hope it keeps going up so you can pay for your divorce too!!!!
get a moissanite ring from china next time simp
The gift that keeps on giving
So beautiful and dirty!
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAH
HAHAH GOTEM
today might be a day for bears but we all know bears are gay.

In china, up is down
I would if I had any money left.
People never seem to mention that Zuck had some big shit CS guy tutoring him and honing his talents 

idk what bill had Im not old enough to know his story
Its gonna be a rough day. Almost 6% down.
yup
my as5hole
Meantime the whole market could be red and thered still be some bull saying ber r fuk
PLTR
Yes. So much news coverage / PR from yesterday. Boomers are flocking to buy it.
Every day is, so that includes today.
very organic, healthy growth!
It's a bold strategy Cotton, Lets see if it pays off for him..
Tesla recall of 9000 vehicles moving it lower in pretrading. Probably going to be a short dip as it is for vehicles made in 2015-2016
this is premarket tard there obviously won't be volume
Its also premarket... 

Not that Im saying sell.
As usual
you dont have to make a play that requires more vertical movement - see ITM debit or OTM credit spreads
F
Wow
it'll bounce back soon if not today
How long until you have to cover?
Cut ur losses if it dips below the 5 day moving average
That Black Friday sale be hitting different.
Hes busy buying shares of PLTR
Delivery guy probably just didn't feel like carrying it out of the truck.
Bruh whyd you pay $400 for a fucking barbell. I got a bench bar and plates for like $250 on Craigslist
$400? Was it manufactured by JNUG?
Unless youre deadlifting 1000 pounds you dont need a $400 barbell
Thats an expensive barbell
We aren't too far off

Mccormick's share price has dropped recently from its high around 200, but this is a long term stock
You described how fucked this market is. That's exactly what softbank did but instead of meme stocks it was big tech and qqq calls.

Now everyone else will be doing it

Legit bought $28c for 0.30 at open. EZ quick profit
40
Easy moneyyyyyyy
Me too
What Cramer say
I sold mine yesterday 
Let me see your dick
I bought these on a whim last week. Not sure if I should sell yet or hold a little longer.
Ha. Haha.. bought at open and was up 150% in seconds for a $25 11/27
The dip each day is getting higher than the previous day's close... I'd just go for it
Commenting to follow
Yes
"Don't you tell 'em what we do  
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you don't even  
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em,  
You don't even, you don't even gotta tell 'em,  
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em  
You ain't even, don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em  
You ain't even, you ain't gotta tell 'em  
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em"
Need to find support lol, just in case
Nah thats big money fuck it
Nah bro percentage wise thats mad!
same... I play covered options conservatively and make around $500 a week. This week, i broke $2,000 just off of playing $500 in PLTR calls :)
Bro a 7 bagger is incredible. Congrats. And fuck you
This is probably his doing...telling all his boomer fucks on madd money to start taking profits
I blame Cramer for this
More PLTR
FSR, close to breaking ATH. Hasn't pop like other EV yet.
  
Jumped back in
I sold at 26 :(

To get back in deeper OTM at 25 woooo let's ride this bitch into the sun!
Ill settle for 27 :)
try 50%
It fucking better
I dunno why but this fuckin got me lmaoooo
I'm already on Mars bro 
Bro I legit had the worst 2 weeks of my life with withdrawal when I did it. Fucking miserable.

I was borderline diabetic though so it was a major change for me
How much have ya dropped
Check out Choc Zero
I used to have proper sugar cravings. Have you tried keto cause I found that helped me
>level 1griswalt7200929:3:12 points  just now

I've been trying to cut down on sugar for a while now. Shit is worse than drugs..

Finally stopped drinking coffee and cutting down on deserts/snacks next..
Not even fruit?
Thats just the tip
i got in late hold me.


I rolled my 1/15 40c into PLTR this morning at the top but there may end up being a new top.
I agree, long term for sure
Technically hes not mine

finally
Why don't you buy Lockheed, Raytheon, NG, GD, etc? Those are more American.
5% a year is a good ROI I will have you know mister! <shakes fist>
stonks
Im literally telling everyone I know and all my family to buy PLTR
keep doing that for a 2 bagger today
They have my info, expecting mine soon.
AP: Palantir Technologies to buy Tyson Foods in order to expedite chicken tender delivery supply chain
Really?  What pos?
SEC be sleeping yo
And those $30 calls in that meme will be ITM and everyone here called them retarded lol
What wall?
More like end of lunch break
Ye
$30 EOD
It changed mine. Ive made so much money idk what to do with it.
its entirely possible
1.8k into PLTR good luck to all memers
lmfao
100% buying opportunity this morning - bogus headline about another OTC Chinese EV
Sir, thatll be 3 foundries and 50 gothams
Sell Friday and roll out if you are bullish
how much are you up?  can take a little profit.  or roll some forward.  You should always think about target prices for profits and getting out.  Usually when something doubles I take profit and then think about where could this really go next and maybe get an option a little further out.
Same!
Im selling friday
THIS. Dont want to hear any bitching when we hit 30.
LMFAOOOO
This is the way
Lol what dip
Why you yellin
How early are we talkin
It might float 50-54 for a few days then boom again
We nurish it, we stroke it, we choke it.. In the end we moon with it
SEC, its this guy
Got damn thats a lot of capital
God damn fuck you
Just gunna flaunt that insider trading huh?
Been in that one all week. Nice, steady tendies.
Stay mad
Ty for your service
what u been buying?
Congrats and fuck you
Thas what weve been saying
Ive said 100 in a year since IPO, we might hit that in 6 months
Ya, true. But this growth isnt sustainable. Wait for a red day where IV lowers and pricing is better.
Pltr is what was down lmaoooooo. Comeback of the century
Rly? Brooo imagine
Positions or ban
Lol at this rate we hit $50 by 3pm
holy fuck no way. How old are you
like ever
Energy and healthcare too
Its also a boomer play cause boomer companies use it too.
str8 up facts

Thats how you lose money
F it I went 31c 11/27
what do you mean when you say 22c and 30c?
Buy more
My exit is at 40.
Never
This place alone will get it to $30.. bet your sweet retarded ass
Whooooooo PLTR 
Yeah it was a week ago lmao
Dont even care
Set a trailing stop loss and update it regularly. Best way.
Bro, I was gonna sell at 22, but I diamond handed that. Got shaky at 24, but still held. Now it's just pure greed. I have no idea when to sell, because my gut instinct has been wrong twice.
None
Stop saying that
Same homeboy. In at $9.635. What about you?
Exactly how what I read about in those day trading for Dummies books
Shambles they are in - Yodas Cock
Never feel bad about coming out positive
you made money, that's the whole point. holding out for a stock to stretch like crazy puts the odds against you
All the covered calls I sold are ITM.  So its all going to get called away if this holds until Feb
What did you do with that cash?

aLwAyS tAkE pRoFiT
TOOOOOO MARSSSSS 
timber!
Hindsight ho
No this is a dip
Dude good on you. Thats 100% more than you had this morning for the next position you take.
Lol me too, dont worry. Its still 100% gain!
Taking profit is better than losing all of it being greedy
Same lmao
This is a rare time when Fomoing back in will still benefit you
remember tsla at 30 pre split? :D
Please insert 500 mil
lets fucking gooooo
called it
this post needs some DD flair.
like all you said, but you left off a 0....
You can and will do better
Good riddence man. I'm sure it sucks but it'll get better
Sounds like you got out of a shitty situation, now make some gainz
If true that sounds pretty shitty man, keep your head up, make some good money, maybe buy yourself VR for Christmas.
If thats true holy hell man Im sorry
PLTR 
Good decision to take profits, bad decision to not reinvest sooner
Nice. Youre forgiven 
Im witcha!!!!
And its working!
Youre looking in the wrong solar system.  PLTR is inter-galactic
Remindme! 1 day
Proof or ban in 3 hours
Nice have you decided what youre going to do with your free money?
Nice, have fun

LETS GOOO
Lol I bought FSR shares like a moron two weeks ago and they immediately went red
Toronto guy here, u talking trash boi?
If your playing memes you gotta buy a hedge or two
If youre holding far out expiries, just hold and don't look. If you've got weeklies, F.
Long term you'll be just fine
Lol

Plus, market makers are gonna suck the vol right out of those.
VoLaTiLiTy
Elon giveth, Elon taketh away
really shows the people who are into weeklies around here when they are kicking and screaming when we have one big red day. Like if you are reacting that way... then maybe this isn't the place for you.
Levels not seen since 3:20 pm yesterday.
my time to hop off CRSR train and join the TSLA train maybe daddy Elon give me a sign
And I will take their discounted shares with a smile.
If you want to lose all your money, sure
LOL
Theta
Same bro..
So what you gonna do when market open?
What do you think a good entry point would be?
WSB is therapy brah
Got my appointment at 11am today 
But I need the dip.. to buy more PLTR 
Only paper handed fucks are acting doom and gloom. Nothing doom and gloom about a small dip today
The meme stockers looking at the day ticker instead of the week or month and panicking. I had 20% growth on Monday that was obviously going to correct itself
This is the way

Do they lose twice as much or half as much?
Youre actually right, invite only
Its just a conspiracy
Looks like a fire sale on EVs

really think we can see $282 again today
Same time it always does. 4
Didnt even get to buy the dip
Are you not entertained ?
TSLA went from 506 to 309 in about a month. Dont test it.
this is not the dump. dump comes later. this is momentary dip
Yeah. They cause panic though, and sometimes it backfire into a really load of fuck though
Hedge funds pumping/dumping to trap the bulls/bears in pre-market
Big Tech bulls still elusive af.

lolz
CRSR has the biggest dick
560 looks good here, maybe
11/27 $30C here

How about EOD
I don't know anymore... is there a ceiling to this stock? lol I guess this it what it felt to live in the late 80s.. PLTR ONLY GOES UPPPP
I would GTFO
10k?? Sell some at least
Once pltr drops a little everyone will rotate back to nio
Fuck that!
buy more at 25, won't matter when it hits 50 in a year
I bought at open ATH yesterday for 23.27.
Its okay just dont sell when it dips a little... puss puss
I flipped my calls and if I sell these Ill get marked as PDT lol
>buying a stock thats up 39% in 3 days at its ATH
F
bruhhhhhhhhhhh
Here's my support:
I'm up over 50% solely on PLTR shares bought last week at 16.60
pltr is 100% of mine
Accidentally 75%. How can you help it with that Black Friday sale?
yes
30+ EOY
My price target is $50.00 by march
Idk just cashed in my 22/26 for Friday and reinvested  90% of it in 26/31 for 12/4 and 30/35 for 12/11..

Might have missed a little equity but i sold above 26 and I bought during the dip
Probably going to be similar to CRSR

Get out before the top I guess
It does that at least once a week, this aint it, the squeeze will be far more violent than that.
We dumping end of day?
Every day is the short squeeze day! Time to show those cucks whatmeans!
so easy
true autism
Depending on how many you bought youll be rich
Good
After seeing the selloff from CRSR and NIO, I'm staying away from PLTR until I see the same happen
I doubled down. Ill triple down if I have to.
Congrats bro.
Is it too late to get in?
that wall could disappear if the seller thinks they can make more
It touched 26.39 today already
By 12 for sure
Yes US steel is the hottest stock right now. Never too late to get it!
Middle of next week lol
Yes
$40
End of next week maybe
at this rate it will be EOW
Im 100% profit. And im not selling shit
oump and dump
today
I expect itll dip around $17. But idk, its got a lot of momo in the short term
No its an ATM.
LETS GET THAT PLAYSTATION BOYS
I thought we were going for $30 EOD?
I keep hoping out for the dips and in for the ups. Small account, its been helping to bring me back to green this week and I even started late but FOMO finally got me, Im glad it did too!
What play
$16 1/15C
Duh
Feb 17.5$
That's all i have, Jan15 35C
PLTR is really on some other shit huh
*EOD
$60 EOY 
Need 50 by 12/25.
take the profit and roll out to a pltr 30c... it should cost you 1/3... even if you lose it all you still get to enjoy a lot of your profit...
I think youre gonna make me sick
Wait till it shows signs of pulling back, or youll regret selling early like me
Had the same position but sold back when it was a 2 bagger because Im a full-on imbecile
U ok?
You know it's happening
It's a money printer with government contracts.  That's really all there is to know.  But don't take my word for it... I'm retarded.
Keep doing that for me bro. Daddy wants a blonde call girl for Christmas
I can reverse this bull trend with one share purchase as well
No one, stop being poor and get 25k
same brotha
I think it'll be at 30 before then
me!
True hero
The world is unfair
Please and thank you

 **PLTR Dec 31 '20 $27 Call**
Dude by the time I type this comment well be there.
CIIC tripled many people's portfolio is a week.
Gonna bounce off 28 for an hour then crash through like Mandingo
Doesnt matter

PLTR at $50 by February
Hold till $500
This is the way
Its not retarded. This isnt a meme stock. Its a 500$ stock posing as a 27$ stock. Get ready to be in a lambo
It works 
it's grown on me.  I'm in long, growing my position.  No one isn't paying attention to Canoo yet.
And then it will Mars
When does that end again lol
+320% 11/27 26c 
The quarterly wsb purge
this is the way

Congrats...imagine if you had options..

Hell Yeah
Fuck yeah?
Hold forever
Yeah. Monday, March 10 2025
Hardly a dip! Happy little loading zones.

Warheads on foreheads

Excellent.
Penis stir lol

Real talk

I dont call +13% a dip
I sold 30c's too. We might have a problem 
i sold 5x 27c yesterday , w/e gains were made
BREAKING
fucking blessed
Dude have you seen CRSR?
Pretty sure it is
i do too but I think we've crossed a threshold here, we've pushed it mainstream enough that it might stick!
Its my first 5 bagger
This ain't a pump and dump boi.
Still waiting on the nio crash everyone said was bound to happen.
[deleted]
There is no top buy now
This is the way
Over 100M and counting

Bought a single call at $9.30, up 1300%
Raw dog!

Sign up! It's the least we can do for these gains when most of our neighbors are struggling.
 how about helping at https://www.reddit.com/r/SantasLittleHelpers/new/ instead?
Bring Filet Mignon to the soup kitchen and really make them mad! I like how you think!

Welcome to the world of complex financial instruments
Dont miss your exit
Yeah whats that all about? 
cept we keep it pumpin baby
dude i found one too

ticker nio
lol At this point, nothing surprises me.. Are you serious? WSB has been riding PLTR for like 1.5 - 2 weeks now
Am I too late to hop on PLTR? I don't know shit about WSB and reading the FAQ makes my head spin. I could spare a few hundred bucks, but I'm definitely rich and am effected by the COVID bullshit. Can still pay rent and all.
You love to see it
Nope
Also NIO, we gonna have electric China cars and vaccines on the moon!!!
Just in time for unemployment to run out 
Yes they are.
So much FOMO i sold earlier this morning and made a bag but damn
Should of waited for that 1000% gainz
By 2:30
Don't you fucking tease me
absolutely insane
Lmao this brings me joy
Youll get the next one. Who knows. Might be some gas left in the PLTR tank right now.
Same. There will always be another IPO that blows tf up.
What is selling? I feel like Ive heard of it before
Vibes in this bitch
quit job, buy more PLTR calls
Am currently getting paid only 10% of what I made today from 3 clicks I did on my phone this morning. Insane.
Tesla all of the last year.
Every IPO is mispriced to a certain degree. That's why people jump on them quickly. 

Watch for Roblox IPO.
Some retard did say the original IPO price was around $60
Profitable ? wtf ?
No its not lmao. They are a real and srs company but no profit.
And I fucked her say hi to your new little brother.
wait 30 minutes after open to dodge a dildo - then buy the dip
I did that yesterday after the constant nonstop spam and ended buying at the literal peak. At least youre getting in a dip now
I thought they were the mattress company
They grow and sell weed retard
wait i thought they made EVs?
They make peanuts dumbass
They are that recently public company thats been working with the US government since early 2000 that recently switched to giving tendies to all the autists that like free tendies
I think both
I think they sell green dildos on Amazon or something like that
Its the former
They do something?  I thought they just give tendies to all autists that like free tendies
far far in the future. It will only be a 1% pullback so take advantage
lol it was today in the morning like everybody said, wtf you doing
Congrats!! 
Hey kid, I'm a computer.
Fuck yeah dude
I've literally made 4 paychecks worth in a week.
DUDE same. I worked in a call center before I started trading options I made like a month of pay in just 2 days on PLTR. PALANTARDS UNITE
Nice job!
I'm literally making more sitting here working than I actually make for that work
gg's
Just give it to him
Gay!
But sir, it's already well past dawn...

WAKE THE FUCK UP YOU LAZY BASTARD WE GOTTA GET TO TENDIE TOWN ALREADY!

I finally found my twin

Yeah baby. Go up to 40. I need myself a PS5 
Will hang around 23-25 range
looking like today will be a small break before we head to the andromeda galaxy
BUY ALL THE PLTR
Yes
Shes worth a few weeklies
Some sad salty 
Ah let me look into my crystal ball.... I'm seeing you.... At a red light begging for change
Usually when people are at the sidelines, and they decide to jump back in, it means that the market has reached its top. Youre too late.
Youll be fine, just be patient
I would do the same
Stonks I hope. Not options. Not with your life savings.
If you are playing the long game then you should be fine. I have a feeling there's going to be a slight pullback after the big runup though. Perhaps selling some cash secured puts at a lower strike price would be a good way to get in a dip?
You FOMO'd a bit late.I was bullish with PLTR, but I don't know about today. I have a weird feeling about it.  
Either it's like a 20% day.. or -10
It's a buy once it hits $18 today
The best gains happen in the gym bro

Im about to put 20k in it
because eurochads and ameripoors
The mysteries of the stock markets
wow
Why so? Im on trading212 as well
Amen

Where to move, shit sucks..
Is there a better platform for CFDs etc in the UK?
Any alternatives?
Tastytrade
Same retard Im full yolo put now
RIP Brother.
Which do you have? I was selling the 56 and even 60 yesterday surprised people were buying them
25c 12/8 what Im going for 
Things just keep getting more and more bullish. Rotation and pump been flawless lately. Ride the train


Wait until 8:30 est to buy

**COILED SPRING**
Oh we buying the dip!
CHINESE INVESTIGATION INTO ALL EV COMPANIES
Only the boomers are getting exposed by their paper hands
I bought a call at 12am due to fomo hype... canceled that shit just now lmao
$30 EOY. Some pullbacks between now and then. Mondays Green big time.
This would actually ruin thanksgiving for me. My condolences
Imagine if you had sold spreads or covered puts.

This is the one week where Theta fucks the buyers, hardcore
Lol
All good points. I already cashed in yesterday though 
Have you even been to China? I work in private equity doing some deals in China and there is a serious lack of parking in China. Many people in tier 1 cities street park because they live in 30 year old buildings with literally no underground parking. You think people will buy EVs and charge them where? This isnt America where everyone lives in houses with garages. The real money is in parking management in China.
Get a real addiction like meth.
Have you tried cocaine?
don't look at porn
Chaturbate?
Its nice to have friends
What if Im already holding calls??
What if were the dip?

I went from GUH 40 minutes ago to 40% up on my entire portfolio 10 mins after market open. I'm sure it's gonna go up more but I wayyyyyy exceeded the profit I was going for and I don't wanna lose it, so I'm out for now
Then ill get puts
It's already at 25...
There is no top
Exp date?
Proud of you. Make it a TSLA

Strap ur tiddiesss!!
In reality, no. Just a bunch of folks panicking at the news and hitting "sell" with thoughts of LK dancing in their heads.

Hell yea
Probably.  If looks like it's holding 43
For the second time this morning. Surely this is the last dip!
What I was hoping for when I bought an 11/27 $28C haha. Small paper to buy dinner tonight.
Pretty much, all I needed for profits was that tiny peepee decline
At the price it is now what position?
Gods work
Then sell a put spread
It got close today, trust its retard strength
It's taking a breather. Wait to see what it starts doing after 11.
Squeeeeze like it's your last shit in life
nah fuck you. You should've been riding the Friday contracts like a real player
Fuck your bear ass. PLTR hitting $28 by EOD
Ehh you should have sold at 3:59 yesterday. the prices spiked real high and i missed it. just sold my calls for a bit less a few minutes ago because i believe we may go down one more time but if not, im just gonna wait for a pullback. you made the right choice imo
thank you for your service
When Elon sees old pics of his hair.

Rumor is PLTR just got a contract with the Fed to print all the tendies for them
YESSSS

The next move IS pltr. If you don't understand that by now you aren't thinking big enough.

On god
I just know they will get squired by TTD next year. The only possible move.
start becoming? youre a certified retard
I stopped looking at shit I sold, all the money left on the table is a bummer
damn, congratulations
You typed 50 wrong
Sell it after it reaches 100 next month.
Your calls expire at some point so either sell or hold and buy the shares.
never
Correct. Who sells a money machine?
Correct
Same boat as u. I get my trades back Friday but Im just riding the vibe out
Ikr?
LFGGGG!!!!
yes
stonks only go up, what did you expect?
Theres a lot of people here, calls have x100 underlying
Nothing to see here.
more buyers than sellers
gonna be the topic of conversation at every dinner table. Watch all the 21 year olds but their Boomer grandpas on this finesse
Lol dude I sold a 27c right after buying in and then it immediately shot up above strike LOL. Whoooops
You think it will burst? I got 35$ calls to march. Is already over 200% profit. But Im afraid of getting greedy and losing it. Should I sell?
Then make babies
Always wait for a red day to get shares, it will go down again
I'm slowly averaging up
Im just selling short expiry OTM puts at this point with how high IV is, worst case I baghold at a lower price, long term I figure it cant go tits up
Would say do not jump on a fucking huge big green and wait for consolidation. In this case Palantir became a wsb stock. Normal rules may not apply. Bought early and stocked up this morning (Germany) not sure if I would buy now.
long term, no. Short term, yes... but stop being a Bear and get on this YOLO  
MGNI!!!!!
thic boy bro everyone will make money
Roblox coming soon

Loooks great, but i dont wanna buy after a 20% day. I currently have a 25c 12/18 i bought on Monday
Maradona says buy the PLTR dip

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Just starting too
How dawg? Just buy PLTR and TSLA 12/24 you'll be good
PLTR yes you can
My guy just take a break for about a month a reflect on everything youve done wrong. Same shit happened to me I made 3 big losses was down to about 8k left relaxed for a month let my emotions settle then go back and make smarter trades
Being over Confident in a trade killed me a few times
35
I bought them at $17 and Im asking the same question
Do not ever sell. If you have even an ounce of patience hold this shit for the next two years.
No, stocks only go up.
Good chance home bly

Lol ok dude. No reason at all. Except ballooning a few hundred percent between them in a matter of weeks. Nope no reason.
Duh
All day 'ery day
Yep
JD dip might be worth a buy
Its because everyone has weeklies. Thankfully my calls are a little more than a month out.
Yeah, I was ready for this pullback yesterday!
>reasonable voice  

wrong subreddit
EV is definitely a bubble. Higher valuation than established brands, despite extremely low sales, high competition, and uncertain future
Im sure youre not referring to chinese ev stocks
Id wager most of the kids in this thread arrived over the summer.
Been here since March
But just for today lol. 
U are absolutely retarded lmao

Is LI the Chinese van one?

If so, Im all in.

False..... PLTR gives everything it does 110%
Almost as good as rona survival rate
Im fighting the urge but Im already balls deep in it
How could you not at this point? It's a fucking monster
Buy me a hoe
Dibs
Ill remind you
never doubt PLTR, this shit has some retard strength    
Im so sorry I made money in Palantir, now that my support base knows.  Promise Ill keep pretending to care about the things I say I do!
Calls my friend
worth it. pltr IS the job now
From 4% down to 1% down in like 15 minutes. Unbelievable
Don't drop out. Anything but that
Degree is worth millions. I don't even use mine in my field but I have 100k job.
Thats true. You dont learn many job skills, but that doesnt matter. Its all a game and the truth is that having that piece of paper will open many more opportunities and lead to higher pay. Its annoying, I get it, and it doesnt make much sense. You gotta play the game though man. Grad school is the real game changer if you can hold on
The benefits of college is access to student loan to YOLO and degree to mortgage to YOLO again
Finish it. If you dont, recruiters will see that you cant even follow through with a basic ass 4 year degree. How could they trust you to work for them with that ethic? This only applies for working for others. If you know what you want to do, then do it. But if you plan to rely on a company to pay for your life, at least do the bare minimum and finish your degree.
Yeah.. just get the degree. You'll be glad you did.
Go to a cheaper college, but know that youll get paid more just for having a piece of paper
It's actually becoming a more popular idea that gaining a degree is less useful than it used to be. Labour market is saturated with graduates, but some companies won't touch you unless you have a degree, meaning if you mean to get one you had better make sure it's a top notch piece of paper.  


The rest of the students that get niche qualifications that are average or good, rather than mainstream top notch simply exist in the machine to carry debt throughout their life.
Go have fun. I had a lot of fun in college, but I regret not having more
If you drop out, pick up welding. Learning to weld will land you a 6 figure job easy if you're willing to relocate to just about any decent sized city/port.
College is more than just a piece of paper.  It's an opportunity to meet people, explore interests, and become more well-rounded by taking classes in things you're ignorant about and being exposed to ideas that are new to you.  

It offers you so many new experiences that it helps you develop into the person you're going to become.  

College certainly isn't for everyone, but I would encourage you to stick with it and try to get as much from it as you can while you're there.  There's plenty of time to make money, but the opportunity to take part in what college offers is temporary.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  

Or YOLO $PLTR or whatever.  It's your life.
Its not to make you smarter. Its to prove your dedication to the machine. I never use my degree but it has opened up many doors for me. Hang in there. Do not yolo your tuition money unless it is to pump PLTR or T H C B
I signed a gap year for my private uni around 2 years ago and still havent touched that shit. Man fuck college/uni tbh
Hahaha true. 

Scared money will miss the buying opportunities 
Oh you think you're cool because you can divide by 5? It's 560, go suck a dick nerd
Im sorry
Prayers for your fam bro
She gonna leave you any money?
Bullish!
PLTR!!!

Don't short meme stocks!!
Its an electric vaccine as a service that will be given to customers in low orbit. Did I miss any buzz words?
It was $30 EoY and the mods said they'd buy everyone with at least 100 shares a PS5
How much you down?
Not really into weed stocks but knew they cant hold for more than a day so bought a put yesterday
Yep. Almost want to send myself 20k and go full retard in it.
Something about a market cap for ants
all the spacs not just one.
Because there are too many tards pump and dumping. They should get permabans
Rule against pumping penny stocks. The weed SPAC trying to acquire battery company falls under rule apparently.

Bought in at $17 so not worried
I know, I regret buying puts. I got too scared, now it looks obvious like a huge pump day again.

I thought we'd be down 3% on economic number fears. If they beat, we are going stratospheric
Your greed is your downfall. But thats why were here on WSB
Hot take
Nice
PLTR calls 100%
In my opinion, don't touch either of those today. They are coming off of a huge unwarranted rally and are down PM, going into a short holiday week. We will likely see some more profit taking/panic selling

On the other hand, buying the dip has worked like 2 weeks in a row....
Id say PLTR & TSLA
Pltr
Tesla
Buy high sell higher
Did the same with FCEL, looks like I'm selling covered calls to recoup losses for a while
Lol
Stonks only go up. Once the dust settles, guess what happens???




The dip has just begun
The degenerate train is leaving, destination, palantendies land 
The answer is always yes
I mean that fuck had paper designs man
5$ up, 5$ down. What does that remind you of? That's right, gravity.

Doubling??? I would never buy anything
Sell it in PM and rebuy during day, its gonna be sell of in the morning and buy back them

organic growth bullish as fuck
50/50. Diversify.
More thic boii more better

Why what u in?
same, I jus bought pltr at 25.71, I'm hoping it will hit 30 by Monday tho.
Im sitting on +2 9.50 12/31 calls. After hours and close yesterday were looking like fucking profit hotness was going to happen today, then Morgan Stanley had to come in with their bitch ass $9 price target. Fuck you Morgan Stanley. Fuck you.

May be it was on purpose

What are your short term positions? Im long on BABA. Also went long on BILI.
Nice gotta play those low IV stocks
Ya I wanna sell CC but barely get anything from it now
So many thirsty retards like us ready to buy in.
Yeah - its a rigged game.
Whats plug power bro
Wtf is that a glitch?
Jesus christ that is insane
Wonder what the volume was, and why the hell so high?
Im thinking its time to buy calls, right?
I bought some calls. Let's get it 
We all knew it
Everyone starts small, youre on your way kid 
Patience
this is the way
Id be happy with even $47 at this point.
haha its a dip
I feel like if its ant call then just expect to print money
send it
lol i just bought some 30c 12/24 today, they had slightly lower IV
Monday I would have said no way. Today? Why the fuck not?
Dont think so, people taking profits and then panic sells most likely, seems to settle around 43 rn tho
Dont think so, most people are speculating sell off pre Black Friday buy shit

Why wouldnt you?
So your gains will be solid
Ouch

Profit is profit. There will be more chances boi

Get on in. Were about to break the atmosphere.
I bought 50 shares 30 seconds ago 
Sooner the better just do it only going up
Whenever the fomo gets overwhelming thats when the rug gets pulled
If you're going to buy shares, just do it now and forget about it.

Im praying to god for a sell off 

Dip will get deleted in 2 days max
I think it can hang out at +10% all day or finish up 5% what's the difference?
lmao for real. they probably know exactly why this is happening though
A consistent 20% is nothing to sniff at, especially if you're mitigating the risk of losing it all.
If you want 10,000% you need to yolo on FDs
White is clean, Urus or Aventador is the question
Also considering this
Lmao you sold that to me bro 
paper hands.
I see this as an absolute win 
28+ eod
I was waiting for this comment!
Theres no fucking top. Infinite money glitch.
Next NIO

People will regret buying in 20s when its 40+ in 3 weeks

Peter Thiel: Good, now keep doing that everyday

Smash sell. Take profits
Hold until up 1000% duh
depends how many hookers you want tonight
you know the market is closed tomorrow and friday is a half day?
That's a terrible fucking bad-beat there.
How bad is the damage?
Im at 450% gains and dont plan on hopping off this  anytime soon
Just scalped 20% off of some $35s expiring next week.

Im in leaps so I need to mess around somehow or its boring.
So did everyone who bought at $15
I did that yesterday at the literal peak $24.22 and was shitting myself all day because I ended bigly red and then we started tanking in pre market and I shat myself more. Look how it ended
Remember: in dodgeball Vince Vaughn yolod everything he had and won. You got this brother
Have a feelings MMs are too stupid to pick on this one. Would have bought in the 100k+ otherwise. When whales buy, you see that shit.
You goof

Mine were up 100%. I elected to sell half.
I usually trim at 100%

&#x200B;

Hoping this decision does not bite me in the ass. (I did not trim)
consider proft?
Depending on the broker Id sell it no fucks
Just call your broker they can usually remove it. Unless its RH then youre probably fucked
HA
In N Out double double with fries please
I just bought puts
Yes
Wonder if its the one I was balls deep in last night behind Buffalo Wild Wings
Yeah pretty sure I've seen that video
I usually sell and roll out to hold onto profits
I'm in the same boat as you buddy.

12/4 25c

Considering selling and maybe placing calls further out
Rolling them is always safer but more stressful as youre waiting for a dip that may or may not come
ELI5 pls?
Index funds need to buy 15% of the outstanding TSLA shares of TSLA is a 1.5% weight of the S&P500. Current market cap puts it at Berkshire Hathaway (1.5% weight). Theres US$6Trillion in weighted index funds. 1.5% = $90Billion. At $575 a share that is 156Million shares. That would be around 16.6% of Teslas total outstanding shares. Some index funds by rule cannot add Tesla until the month it is added. So no November purchasing for some big index funds. The lack of sellers is going to squeeze TSLA to 800-900 by 12/21

EDIT: check my math Im a retard but that is how I see this playing out. And I am hoping PLTR is added to the S&P500 too since it now has a market cap over $50Bill
Ive been thinking this for weeks 
Probably another week away at least
Not yet. But soon.
Thanks fellow autist, just bought a bit

Nice what was your position?
You'll regret this in a few months.
Hmm I'm actually am craving martinis
Top? u tripping there is no top   
leaps and you might not need to work there in 3-6 months or risky FDs and you might be able to quit in 2 weeks
How about this: TSLA 565 12/4 calls, I bid at $17.15, order wasn't filled and now it's...dont even want to look. $27 something...feel like shit
I sold my $16c for 40% gain last week o lol

That puts the valuation at around Snowflake's which I think is perfectly reasonable
Honest question, why? I know why its up here but I am having trouble convincing myself it goes on for another few hundred percent
It will go up for the next weeks with a few dips. I will hold shares long term.
Never be afraid to take profits. Im going to today and buy again the next dip

Roll for moar!!
I'm leaving everything in there for now.

You don't counter it you just embrace it
Spreads for sure. Sold a few put credit spreads this week and next. Used premium to buy calls

You counter it by adding to the IV so it never goes down
Sell CCs.

Right? Now i have to hope for the usual one hour after open dip smh
Need to get yourself a real brokerage son, some of that good GTC+ order shit.
Weeklies are a helluva drug
Cramer you beta cocaine fueled cuck. YOLO WSB 0DTE FD

I like this guyyy
Yup
Just bought 20. Should I fuck myself and buy another 20 IDKKKK
this is the way
Youll fit in great here buddy
Damn Thats fucking gangster
Sold too soon
i need confirmation bias tho
**SURELY THAT'S A SELL SIGNAL NO???**
hahhahahahaha FACTUAL
So should I get into PLTR or no?
Bruh, the qustion is, is it time to buy more?
My friend just messaged me Redditors think PLTR will be very good long term and I just got her interested in stocks so there are plenty of people still
get ur bag ready !! we heading down for the weekend      
$28 now lol :)

money money money..................money

I have leaps so I am boring and won't sell
Time to buy puts then?
Then you lied, since it was up 10% with 5 more hours of trading?
Congrats bruh! Upgrade your life with the gains!
I love you bro
I am genuinely happy for you
yeah, once you get a certain amount of money you can do shares and make meaningful amounts of money on plays.  you can also do LEAPS which gets you some leverage and smooths out the chaos over time if you actually believe in the stock long term as well.  I don't believe in PLTR long term so I couldn't justify throwing money into it, especially after I was late to the party.  MGNI though, I fully believe this company has a bright future AND it's just now getting discovered by the market.  So I think it will shoot to 30 and then just be a steady gainer over time.  I've got shares, dec calls, and june calls.
Sir, if you have an erection lasting longer than 48 hours - call your doctor. Just kidding, buy even more PLTR calls.
This is the way. Don't paper hands. Make more money to invest in other things and keep PLTR long-term
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I thought we agreed on $40
$50 EOM
FUCK YEA I DO
WSB. Apes together strong.
Yea whats going on
Us
Thats literally it. Lmao
Every insto in the world wants a large piece and retail is forcing them to buy the ask

Also no sellers yet
now you experience the power of autism from WSB driving the market
PLTR is now tech, government and vaccine stock all rolled into 1
Momentum my friend
Yes!!!
Id cum
Stupid   

They should stop listening to Cramer.
Subscribe
I dont understand the combination of fancy numbers and letters in your post above. Powell goes brrrr and PLTR to Neptune is all the investing info I need. 
Stfu
Weed bb gets the juices flowing
to the moon 
This was all priced in when this news came out eons ago
Only if you like money
It worked
WE HELD THE LINE
That would require 4 quarters of positive EPS.
>

 
HELL YEAH!!!
PLTR $10 Today
We are all shitting ourselves but we are MF  this shit
As a newbie to this subreddit, thats alarming
Historic lows
Buy some calls please
Let the paper handed pussies leave, only up from here
Haha just hold. The paper hand bitches who werent in it long term. Blah blah, Ill just buy back in bitch, what fucking logic is selling high and buying in higher??
Yes
Do you like making money?
Yes!
Yes tell ur mom
I'm not fucking selling!
Future as our contracts expire this week
EV's are straight shit. I agree the hype wave is not over, but EV's are 1) NOT GREEN and 2) just a fuckin form of transportation.

&#x200B;

So, DONT SHORT, but understand that the run will eventually end when people find out EVs suck balls.

&#x200B;

Only reason why Automakers love going to EV is because they dont need to adhere to any emission standards. Do I think an E-Truck will ever happen? Fuck no unless its hauling TP cause battery tech cant handle torque demand. Also... so much E-waste compared to combustion engines.
It is the future and too high
\*Raiders

*raiders
Should we buy more is my only question
Get out !!
Nah check stock twits
that is a special community for sure
What about the webull chat section
Look at that volume too lmao
Very legal and very cool
ya, this is it
Lets goooo
I still dont have a clue what CRSR does lol
PLTR $50 by end of year is honestly not a crazy possibility. Joining Tesla and NIO as this years meme stock history.

My TA agrees with you
PLTR 100c , buy today dont regret
100%
$30 axe
Timeframe?
Iv used all my day trades on it already lol
Sounds to me like you care more about his approval than actually making money
Your coworker is what I refer to as a moron
Did you show him your gains tho?
PLTR is an actual beast, unlike these other pump n dump memes.  Company been around since 2004 and has developed powerful tools for deep data analysis.  This will be a future FAANG.  Not in time for WSB FDs, but maybe 2030.  Could it be temporarily overextended right now?  Of course, but Im holding these shares to the grave.
eow
Lol no
SameIm not getting shit done at work today
This week last I've made more than double my monthly white collar job paycheck. It's been awesome
I'm up about 1.5 months of wages, in addition to the covered call premiums

feels eggscellent
I own 10 PLTR Jan 21 2022 12.5Cs.  I will be exercising these some day as well.

But for now I'll just hold my 600% gains in a month, lol.
Same. I almost went all in around $15 but lacked conviction
Same
You guys are such losers
I think it has to do with PLTR being a direct IPO.  It's catching up to the level it would have been at if it was a traditional IPO with the banking cartels huffing up the price with their marketing and promotions.  So this IPO came out as a discount.  Wherever the eventual correction is would probably be what the IPO would have been released at in a normal IPO situation. 

&#x200B;

Just a guess.
F
Gg retard
this is the way
See you at the moon brother
Feels like a good joke now doesnt it
Those gains are a nice punchline.
I wanna see the losses badly lmao
you are a valuable human being and an asset to your community
nd hitting all the stop losses
I have weeklies, and Im definitely not selling at open. Riding this bitch out. Hopefully we battle back to 280+ by friday
You can say the same everyday for the past week
ATH is 24.5~ and now is at 23.5~.
Get in loser.
Buy hi sell hyer
you mean the new bottom? like your butthole?
I dunno, picking stonks at ath is a good way to pick winners. Not for options maybe unless u get good entry
Relax bro. Chill. Maybe just wait till Friday after 7 green days in a row
CAT send me 30$. Feels good man.
Cisco was the largest company in the world for a while as the internet was built up. 
Tesla will do the same within 10 years
I read its priced in like 5 years of sales (tho if they can pull off robotaxi business its another game but I think thats 10+ years down the road realistically)
solar already took off the had to increase prices because there was to much demand.
Its flat
Hopefully just doing its runners stretch.
Hold that little bb

How much did you buy it for?
Sell when you're in the money, and buy half shares, half more OTM calls.
as is tradition
rug pull again? that would be funny af
Diamond hands bro 
Holding 282.5c 12/24 call me a clown
Shouldve sold it at the close like the rest of us did when it was up 300%
think most profit taking happened yesterday imo, we're just confirming 23 as support before starting new steeper trend up
Im buying more shares after it dumps today.
At some point today yeah, otherwise you only have 4 hours on friday
Very pumpy..
Everything is down... American evs too
looool
lmao...

&#x200B;

LK, BABA, YY when will you retards learn not to mess with Gynese stocks.
Retards
Lol it never seems to
Hope so
Holy shit no wonder my stop loss triggered
It's still higher than open yesterday, calm down
Relax. The stock never goes down. And if it does today its just some profit taking and will be back at it by Friday.
Dominion strikes again. Theyre changing the numbers for xpev too!
TSLA ran up $150 in a week, what more do you want?
Do you only have 1 contract? If so I would take profits as soon as possible and if you feel confident buy back in on the dip 
If you have more than 1 than you can sell half and let half ride but I do fell that a correction into the low 40s high 30s is imminent
I am holding 55c for December 2021 for that reason :D
Be greedy
Take profit. Jump back in if you're feeling spicy
I honestly think you should sell dude but I don't know shit
Will rise once markets open
Should just be a healthy pull back. Hope it doesnt break 22.50
Not a bad call. See how it goes then jump back in
So many retards oH No ReD tImE tO SeLl
The real test is whether to sell the hedge for profit, or keep it until the stock half recovers and you lose money on both sides

Wutt? Any ticker to play?
British EV?
That one's dumping too
As a European, I second this!
And to the person who sold me BLNK $15Ps
Honestly some people are delusional when they see these things tanking like its to be expected
I dont see it happening but wouldnt be surprised if it did
S&P futures off 0.10%, Down futures off 0.20%, Nasdaq futures up 0.20%

Calm down
To the trenches!
yeah, puts
lmao PlantEar
You were going to intraday covered calls?
Because... GYNA

All my gains from yesterday thanos snapped
This is the way, Im loaded with tlry weekly puts
What if I hold my phone upside down
Quality analysis
If this dips under $22 Im loading up on shares I suspect others will do the same.
Both good plays. Youre fine.
For those who are holding Puts, yes.
I just might.
Look at the chart.. looking ripe to pop
Lol
Sorry for your loss

Option prices dont update until market open so mines still nice and green thank you.
How dare you assume I'll be red.  But you aren't wrong 
You really think the chillman still snorts coke before his show?
If you like money
All in on cowboys losing
Unless you are taking a long weekend and cant handle the heat.
Great play but IV is super high
He's still knuckle deep in his cousin, hows he going to free up a hand long enough to pick up the phone and dump those shares?

Edit: F 12/31 9.5 C
Lolol there is none
Everyone else is sleeping on this, just need to put more rocket emojis next to the ticker and everyone will jump in
Using finna is why your account is going down
Bruh its already low pm
Thankful for this dip
WSB proves ~~great~~ minds think alike
I'm in RCL, but good luck to both of us! I think CCL going to 40 and RCL going to 140
I'd sell but I also still wouldn't buy the EV stocks at current prices.
Markets open on friday...
When's your exp? The dump is coming either EOD or Friday/Monday, then back to business Tuesday. Its just the way holidays go
Might have to 
dont sell at the bottom. thought we already went through this?
Dump EVs for PLTR   
EVs are dumping on bad China news and overvalutation so people are profit taking and switching to PLTR 
That would be tight
Child Labor, Illegal Gun Permits, and the new iPhone priced in might have something todo with it. 

But what do I know.
Eventually those spicy chips are going to pay us
Change it to live on new comments part

Jokes on you, I had [calls this whole time](https://i.imgur.com/vtux4qI.jpg) 
AMZN for the next meme!!!
Congratulations on your brain
PLTR with the dick sucking lips
You hate money
Don't be shy man, just show your dick in the gay section of chaturbate and make some extra cash.
Yes
wrong sub
Buy em back and roll em out to a higher strike man
He bought...?
NIO last week 

PLTR this week

What's next?
What direction does it usually point?
4 times in 20 mins... Im having a day today!
PLTR is lord and savior, feels good man, I just passed my 3m deficit, aiming for my 6m (when everything went red on me), hope it keeps the momentum up through the new year
Do you have any positions
Uh it already exploded.... first time its moved more then 10 cents in a year and half
You belong here for sure
Uh...tbh Ive seen them swipe that money out quick as hell.  The withdrawing from rh to my bank was watching paint dry,
They come out like the next day but get confirmed by robinhood 5 days later
Were lucky to see this company at these prices...a fucking steal
Inshallah
Went from down 100 percent to almost even
They bought ?
Who sold PLTR at the top? 
Sold at 26$ lol
In this market that will be the ATH for about an hour
YOURE ALMOST THERE
Does Elon shit in the woods?
Yes

psth
GME baghold to 100
TSLA getting involved in China EV Market....Regulatory Scrutiny...I'd say flat for a little bit
Over valued

Thank you
me too buddy, me too. If it hits i got $100 for u
Bless up
Think that's crazy, look at PLTR.
Isn't the week basically over?
WE GOING UPPP
It is time
My only regret is I didnt have more money to buy more
yeah added another 400 shares before it started taking off this morning. I keep reminding myself how fun it is that Gamestop is making me money.
Not nearly vertical enough and no real catalyst, so I think not.
Not yet. But shorts are in pain right now
This is just the pre cum
Retards are stronger together
why not buy a real fucking company like GME
Need that shit to skyrocket back
Pray to Jesus it does
Monday by 9:45
Lol once yolo'd an Amazon option and it ticked down $700 in like 15 minutes

wild rides
These are the plays that build character
Buying at open screwed me plenty of times. I wait for 30 minutes before buying now. Open is a great time to sell
What strike and expiration? Premiums are so expensive.
Congrats.
Your welcome. Now please dont come back for the rest of the year. Last week however might be all yours.
next biggest industry innovation of our lifetime?? LOL idiot. It is literally been there for more than 50 years and is just concept of the motor.  
Self-driving on other hand is something big but not every EV have that.
All daddies have secrets
Sup
softbank, probably
Date, strike?
which ones?
date / strike
Yolo
You know what they say, if its good enough to screenshot, then its good enough to fist your dad
Reminds me of that guy who shared his 30k gains to hit -2k right after lmao
Good enough to share good enough to cash out
Yupppppp
-3500 to -1000 

Show me the money
Not selling at all
Get in on that pltr bro
Wait what are shares
Yes
sticking to my gun here (retarded?) , but I think we're going to head south of 362
Im diamond handing these sons of bitches
I YOLOd NIO, but its recovering.
Hello it me
It is time
Actually it can happen before earnings if Cohen wants to take over before Q4
My leaps agree with you
I derisked, but I still have 20 290c for early next year.
Seems like a smart play
Holding Feb $80c so that would be cool
If it could happen before 1/15/21 id be soooooo happy. Holding a lot of 60$ 1/15/21 calls I'd like to unload
300 eoy
Get up to $285 please 
That and Roblox are getting my hard earned cash
Watching them pull a SNOW and quadruple price in the 2hrs pre-IPO

What comes first the stock or the meme
Right here baby. WSB.
Been holding months up 25k on just shares
Sorry dad
IM SO FUCKING HARD BRO
I know 
No. I sold my calls yesterday. It is to overvalued compared to all competitors.
Ez
They just announced a shit ton of new EV chargers in China
Memes move together 

Google it

Bam + 11 cents right there
Buy hi sell lo
Elon comin' for Beezo
Just wait if you want to see a dip. Next month.
Seriously I switched from amazon and went all in on shares lol
Just picked up 200 of CRSR

  
what she order? fish filet
Wait for it to start stumbling.  Its still strong but at the moment.
PLTR calls will give you a quick loan
It better! Need to hit $56 for my call.
I would move onto the next stock. The stock is due for a massive correction.
I held and just bought more at the dip
i believe you but source?
Chinese party?
Covered calls is cheat code trading you win any which way you put it.
Yessss

If you have a drink and piss it out in the same day your account will be locked to piss only mode
you fucked up.
Mine flagged me for male pattern baldness
Lmaoooooo have fun with the 90 day suspension you bag holder
Yup
Well i considered selling, but bought more calls and shares instead lol
I really think 50 is a fair PT for it. I'd feel uncomfortable if it hit 60, but I gotta believe someone will eventually snatch it up while it's in the 40s
are you me
Hopefully I can finally drop my bags
Yes. Govt money
Were still in this brother
Fucked me this week and last week lol
I bought back 23c this am at 400% loss
Sell borderline ITM puts instead.
Mine got called away Friday... sold 10.5Cs when it was at ~9 
I'm not buying into FOMO but I soooooo want to buy rn
It's basically Skynet

Please
Doesn't matter.

Stonk too stronk
Every time somebody says this it goes up 3%
Go for it, Im buying shares and would happily average down.

Free money as long as you dont get FDs
Finally decided I understood options enough to make a safe bet on PLTR this week. I've never been so excited.
It dips for 30 seconds and continues moon
NIO's been going back up 
Long term
both
I wont buy you a ps5 if it hits 29 EOD
I wonder if my covered calls 40c 12/18 will get tripped... just sold em with sky high IV.  


I mean if they do I made so much fucking money anyway I can't be too mad
It has to go back up
Threw a couple bucks on some.
Cash gang mad

PLTR
fuck harder because it's going down!
I loaded up 20k this week. This is the first week I DIDNT play weeklies and instead went a month out for safety. Cost me a million but oh well, I'll take 100k.
BABA, I'm also waiting for this one to take off
Hot take
thats actually what this dip is, its definitely hitting or testing 28 today
You
As in I read it on WSB and am posting it again for confirmation bias
Ive recently started buying 2+ month expiration now that I have the capital to pay the premium. Similar upside and downside is mitigated.
expiration?  I have 12/18 and I'm getting nervous...
Unless youre a gay
I just bought 10 $28c 11/27 LET'S GO
Ayyy 27c 11/27 gang, tbh dont know either up 101 right now
Founder died of being old.
Yes
Yes its boomer
Yep yep 
welcome to the team 
This is the way.
102 shares at $15

40c 18/12

5/21 19C, 21C
25c 12/11
100 2/21 22c, 1k shares 
Dummy thicc IV
it's expensive, but man does it feel good when it runs
Nah
No
Confirm.
Nah I think 27.15-ish is the peak for today tbh. May go higher but the EOD sell-off will knock it down a bit.
No one cares
Doubt
TLDR
#####569 EOD
Still in the early stages of the stealth phase. Smart money is still building up.
Break down you mean?
Thats what Im trying to tell myself this entire time
Just saw them shilling it on CNBC  wsb is goated
Lets get it.
How big was it
uNuSuAl aCtIvItY
PLTR man of the match
I have a ton of calendar spreads Jan and March
Yeah baby
you think its not going to get dumped?
Nah its about the money forsure
what strike
We will see 50 before eoy, if not I will eat a whole apple
It will go to 8 (but on its side)
Have you seen googles stock price?
sell covered calls at least
Big time as long as you just hold onto it.
50 easily. PLTR isnt some vaporware shit like most Chinese EV.
Not sure but if you're after steady boomer gains but I could easily see it with a few hundred mil marketcap in a few years.
Fucking hold the shares for five years
26 price target lets go 
Yeah, holding this shit while everything else rockets, annoying AF
RECTANGLE
Greed is the downfall of man
IV
Probably because it passed the moon and is on its way to mars apparently
Go ahead and put in your two weeks notice then
You cant panic about $40. Itll be thousands until the moon 
I was really thinking about selling $30 covered calls on Monday. Glad I didnt lmao
i bought 40c for February and was shitting my pants this morning
bag hold or take gains EOD?
Same
When you do that, do you take some money off the table, or are you just rolling the entire amount?
No time like the present my friend
Its alright man, theres still time to get back on it, its much easier to say this stuff in hindsight
Bru, sold on the first 10% pop back when it was 11$
move on
my 11/27 27c are sitting at 600%

I'm in the same dilemma right now lol
I feel you. I sold this morning on the short dip.  Sigh... profit is profit
300 still good. I sold half for 200% yesterday.
I bought PLTR shares 3 hours ago and am up 20%...
Calls at open up 300% lol
Autists
It pulled a Jesus on you
lol
I know my chub mightve been a mild erection had it not been for this valium.
Yes.  It will reset the next trading day.
don't want to fuck u over but im 99% that is what will happen. but maybe don't trust my dumbass?

Thats a good f!cking question!
It wont erase it, you'll just be flagged but over the minimum requirements to continue day trading. If your account dips under 25k you wont be able to day trade
replying for visiblity

&#x200B;

" Youre generally limited to no more than 3 day trades in a 5 trading day period, unless you have at least $25,000 of portfolio value (minus any cryptocurrency positions) in your Instant or Gold account at the end of the previous day. This sounds tricky, but it just means that within any 5 trading day period, once you place your fourth day trade **you will be flagged as a pattern day trader and youll need to have a portfolio value (minus any cryptocurrency positions) greater than $25,000 at the end of the trading day to be able to continue day trading the next day.** Your portfolio value is the sum of your cash + stocks + options andfor the purposes of pattern day trading calculationsdoesn't include cryptocurrency positions. "
You have to wait a day
Fucking moon 
PLTR is gonna cover for all my christmas presents. thx pltr 
H-hi 
Thank you for selling those to me!
Greed
Nice
Buy Aapl and holdp
Donate a dinner or some toys . make something outta this paper.
If I wasnt in pltr Id hope I was drone striked
I think I am taking gains in December before lockout. I was thinking $30 next year. Not in two weeks.
Doing my best
Lol tomorrow . Gonna need to update your bot brain
Market closed tomorrow
Yea, and my stop loss triggered on October 20th. Fuck me right in the Booty
Took forever for people to see the growth potential
This is a short squeeze right?
fuck me, i just doubled down on $CRSR
Pltr
31
30.42
32$
Never heard of it???
Its early, dont worry, the FOMO comes during next weeks run.  This week you are being rewarded for finding the gem early
I missed this one. Too distracted by PLTR
Is there a reason for this? And is there room to grow?
[deleted]
Holla
Probably closer to 12/18
Been asking myself the same question
Tough call, people could cash out EOD, and then we have to wait until next week. Either way I'm holding until mid December
Should go up, then drop Monday
Me too, deciding if i I should keep it over the holiday though
Yes buying monthlies and leaps on dips, hasnt failed me yet up 600% :)
Got 2 575c, dont know what to do, out of day trades
600c am i fuked
I am
I bought a 590 for some dumb reason this morning and I think I am lowkey
Who u talking to
Lol wut
I saw that too.  Got 2 contracts 12/18 22c
Anytime now 
When? I need it to :(
By when
i feel ya on this. There was a point yesterday where I had naked amazon 3100c's... I capped them into debit spreads and today those calls hit +6k a contract
Except it typically only last 90 seconds or so...
Chill dude. I like you
Dont dude
Bruh what happened ?
PLTR calls bro
 Nobody tell him
Nobody tell him
It hurt me too
Hope you go BIG green by Friday, bro 
I lost a grand yesterday, went all in pltr pre market and Ive pretty much made it all back
More like 100$$$$$ to the fucking MOOOOOOONNNNN 
..and I love it.
I want to say yes but who the fuck knows anymore
Im in the same boat man!
I am waiting.
I rolled my deep ITM calls into barely out of the money calls, took profit and doubled my # of my call contracts
No buy and sell when its around $33, then buy the dip
Yesssss boiiiiiii 
Gotta hold this one out boiiiiiisssss 
Bro you made almost 100pefcenf gains. We dont blame you
Thats a decent return
I sold at 28.50 aaaaaaaaaa
Holy shit thats nuts. And I'm over here making 1/1000000th of that feeling like fucking Gucci Mane
Within a month is when theta starts to become a hungry monster
To get an idea I'd check out https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/ for different options varying between different tickers. Look at "safe" tech/ETF plays like SPY or QQQ or AMD and then go to more volatile names like TSLA or AMZN, then go a level further and look at extremely volatile plays like NIO or PLTR.
feeling smart is awesome
it's mooning, what dip dipshit?
Calls will reach 69
BUY THE FUCKIN DIP *BRITISH CIGARETTE*
BAN
yeah please support my 50c bought at the bottom today. Scalped three times for 300$ but I need more!
Thats not natural growth?!?
I'm salty I missed the crsr train too
:)
I dont think you can YOLO with $50, but nice!
Congrats bro! Next year June you can buy a PS5
Get in soon or else you won't be able to afford 2 shares!
Fuck em.. fuck em straight to hell
 ope there goes gravity
4% ain't too shabby at all

Classic mixup
2022? Shit will hit that by the spring.

It's premarket bruh chill you're gonna be fine.
Damn mines 100% CRSR and PLTR

Get 100 more
Shit, I guess I gotta match.
Every. Single. Time
As is tradition
Good, now reinvest into Jan 35C
Dont do it
Yeah I sold one of 15c, the most profit Ive made
I just pulled out till the next of the week. Need to money to do something
I yolod and Im ready for some gainz
ITS AB THAT CASH MONEY BABY
pltr $30
Pltr $69 then +10% on 420
I bought some PLTR 100c
Which way!?
That sounds good.  My wife is gonna kill me.
Yes
No GME? Lame
YESSSSSSSSS
Barely even gets a mention here
It has 75m volume today. Get your head out of your ass
No. Its a legit company. Thats why you have missed out on these gains. We told everyone about it when IPO dropped at 10$...
WSB is the Wuhan for the pump.

Loooool
Same with NIO TBH
from what to what?
After hours
March 2021
next fall

need a few more good growth quarters for earnings
Same. Sold for 250% gains when it's now worth over 500%

Realized my mistake and doubled down on leaps
gains are gains
Great DD
I find it so off putting when people discuss stocks IRL. Its like discussing porn imo.
RIP May your mother smile down upon your gains bro
Scary huh
Me. fuck.
Thats the question. Tempted to sell at $30
Yeah thanksgiving 2021
Only retards sell.
No volume after thanksgiving. No point in holding if you got fds.
When's your expiration? If it's this Friday, don't hold it. Theta gonna rape your bootyhole
Up over 600% ..I should probably sell but ouf there are no fucking brakes
HOLD
YEEEEERRRRRRR
yeeeeeeRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Sure :)
::doofs my fedora to you, good sir::
I bought PLTR at 10.60 and I still dont know what they do
Ripping lines already Jordan?
Sounds like a sad life
Not keen on the idea of some company knowing where Ive shit, where Im currently shitting, and where I will shit in the future, but hey man money is money and governments will eat this up. I dont see them going anywhere but up long term.
Strange coping mechanism
This has to be satirical....right?
What the fuck did i just read, gtfo
da fuk?
Did you buy weeklies or something

Im gonna drive a big ol American truck not a hippie golf cart
This is the way
Same brother 
2000$ for me, on top of the 2000$ i put in yesterday after gaining 4000$ for selling at 24$

Shit is presenting itself with a nice, round, bubbly dip in the 22 zone at open...i'm fully erect
Woah dude, dont spend your whole annual salary in one go you madlad!! 
They hate us cause they anus
TBH: That fear is what made me miss NIO entirely.
They never have anything less than a +7%day
They end up being +15% days
Ive been thinking this to myself for weeks as I flip options for profit daily
Momentum, buy high and sell higher
Apply the same logic to Tesla this past year
TH CB
Patiently waiting for it to go up
cant wait
Im high af but still not dumb enough to buy that shit
Not sure how many people realize this yet
People thought DKNG was a meme stock until it became one of the only ways to participate in sports during a lockdown

Shoot for stars land on moon. 30 maybe.
okay we all know that's not happening
I want the crack you're on but I'm widdit.
Mans should just say WSB at this point lmao. Who else? r/investing, r/stocks? All those cowards do is circlejerk about their 0.000779% VTSAX gains and eventually FOMO into our sloppy seconds
Big red by close

Limit down
because hes a piece of shit

Same man. Meme stocks are meme stocks for a reason. I always get on them too late. I should have went in on PLTR earlier but I'm glad I did yesterday
Enjoy your gains

It's pretty feasible if they only started trading in November

Buying up any dip and holding what I have!
but hes somewhat political so *shhh*
Imagine thinking there can't be more than one archetype of successful man
Im literally $10k deep in a yolo weekly option that Im kicking myself for not selling before close
This seems bullish
Pltr 
Calls on ventilator mfgs!!!
Lmao too true
I finally made back my loss selling cc for 3 months.
Tbh, I think RKT has potential long term.
That's literally the only way to sell RKT.
I remember it had my calls a little sad but im staying the course
Save my calls
same, got shares and May calls - the only people who should be worried are weekly call buyers. Other than that I am happy.
Were fine dont worry a bit
Take profit... everything is bleeding and this may be the bubble. Lmao weather the storm. Or did you buy the top at around 53?
What if you have credit put spreads
Were GOOD
Witch 1s fur research

Im starting to think its possible

Nah man, let them take their profits to DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS BIIISH!!!

My first profitable weeklies in 8 fucking months of trading.

Bought 12/18 $45c lmao
You wont regret it
we have a lot more power right now tbh, i see it in the numbas
WSB is the MM
Some Hedge fund guy did a write up last night. Basically said its between us and the active managers fighting for control. the ETF managers just sitting around eating popcorn and enjoying the show.
thicc bae

Better start pricing some yachts
wsb is the market
You got some weak ass paper hands g
To the moon 
Up
*EV
pump roblox to 1T market cap.
What did you start with?
You can sell.  Just cant buy more
Yep. Market closed on thursday, 1PM close on Friday. But its PLTR, you should be safe.
Hold till exp and youll have so much money youll be over 25k and dont have to worry about it
you can still sell
You can still sell but you will get a 90 day ban
Are you already over your 4 day trades? If so then you have to hold til next day (so yeah 11/27) and swing trade. Or you can call your brokerage and they may be able to do a one time lift of the restriction for you
That applies only if you have gold. If you have cash account then you can do what you want
How many day trades have you done recently? You get three freebies and get locked on the fourth
You can sell it. You just won't be able to day trade for 90 days. If you're up by alot, just take the restriction bro. I've been in this situation so many time and holding because I didnt want the restrictions usually was the wrong choice
In the future you can effectively continue day trading by turning naked longs into narrow spreads, then close the next day or adjust as needed. You'll end up making one big Christmas tree.
This mother fucker just joined today and already in PLTR calls. Do you know how to lock in a spread? Tell me your position and I will tell you what to sell, even with day trading restriction.
Thx
What kind of EV does CVS make?
pretty good if some minifigs in there too
It's the first time I read WSB properly. Never leaving this place.

This is the way
When did you buy those WORK calls?
lol u 19y boomer 
Me and you are on the same boat. Everyday is pain.
I could have made $5800 but settled for $500. Remind me too
Man dont sweat it. I'm learning the same lesson this week, but profit is profit. Still made money out of thin air.
Sold adsk for a loss at 931. Would have been 250% in less than 5 minutes after.
same. i sold at open for 90% profit. its currently at almost 400%
I mean, 1400 is more than 200
TSLA... See which way it breaks at open.  Stays up above 550, then it'll continue.

Hung over from getting too high during AH
I wouldn't touch miners, way over hyped. People that don't understand coin, and how mining works are buying these up when they should just buy coin. It's only getting more difficult to mine, and soon they'll run out of coins. I wild shift in prices or difficulty shuts these places down. Coins would need to be double their value to justify these miner company valuations

We going uppies?
Yea taking a shit rn
I'm dumping right now
that is a lot of shit this early morning
Same smh
I did and lost 1k4 in 5 mins lol, quick sold and made it back (and some profit) with PLTR. XPEV can swing 5-10% in either direction in a day and its such a retarded meme stock
Im w you on this 
Were in the same boat
Savings account with better interest rate than the big banks

Ill be down almost 1k at open if it stays at this price
Big caps techs
I have weekly 122c 
Long overdue
Hoooooolllllldddd
paper hands
Double down, this is WSB.
Of course dump
This isn't even enough to wipe out yesterday's gains for CRSR, what is wsb's definition of a pullback?
I sold at the top yesterday! Might grab some 100c leaps today
Whats your estimated target?
Oh ok. So when it goes good, it has everything to do with Buyden and nothing to do with Mango. But when it dumps it has everything to do with Mango?
Wish you good fortune on that one
Just asked my child to say a prayer for PLTR before I left for work. The little asshole said no.
Same went to bed with a big ol boner, woke up with a labia lookin at this market
2 recalls
All I could find is this: (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has filed to recall about 9,136 Model X cars, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V710-9316.PDF
on Wednesday.
Had like 9k recalls but that seems like small potatoes...
Arent you happy Papa bear?
Lol you'll still open red on those probably
TSLA is tanking, congrats
why the fuck would get puts BEFORE DEC 20
Its called rotation. Healthy part of a bull market
VIX is so dead. They might as well start funding social security with all the deposits into it.
Yea SPY down 0.14%, we're probably going green today looking at the daily chart
are you retarded? baba will moon sooner or later
Doubt you can't sell for a profit soon (depending on your entry price). Its been bad news for weeks and it's not going down much. As soon as those stop or we get any good news it's going up IMO.
Gonna be down a lot more at open like my 12/18 280s Im gonna try to hang in there we have a little time
>Idk man I can see BABA finishing each week up $10 more every week for 2-4 more weeks. This week might be a lil fucked because of the shorter trading hours, but I think Baba cane easily hit $285 2 weeks before your expiry

>edit: Also possible it hits it this week. 300 by EOW next week also very possible.
The demand for medical supplies will keep going up as Americans get more and more unhealthy!

Thats why leave casino when u are winning
Yeah TSLa fanboys gonna be made when spy dumps and takes TSLa down with it now that theyre joined at the hip.

Im thinking BLNK. Thoughts?
A man before his time. Could have been Elon if he waited.
Fuck. I thought you were talking about scissors.
Wtf drugs are you on. God this place is full of idiots.
Holy shit! That was a great video. I am going to be late for work now, but it was totally worth it.
NIO is daring to have a red day.  That's my guess at least.  The only EV play have is TSLA stonks so WTF do I know.

Gold pumping as well
Hopefully they do.. I dont have lottos on it, but just to see someone happy on Thanksgiving

Cause I bought some lotto puts at the lows yesterday. Youre welcome.
Least you didnt buy in a 19 lol
Yeah with my luck I fucking knew some shit like this would happen so I sold my calls for barely any profit
At 8 you're good 
What ticker is datt
Depends on how big your dick is
It's had a multi day run up already, not unreasonable to expect some profit taking.
Do some math and see how much down can you hold
Big dildo at open
Unusual options activity said there are a ton of $21 calls for next week, take that as you will
I remember that mistake
Gonna get in. don't really know what the short term.ceiling is but the company sounds good.
Or if their is competition, it is a bespoke solution made by the government for the government.

Im livid
It's been redirected to CRSR.
Yeah, I got a 55c for Jan 15th. Its painful losing that much money so quickly at open, but I have time for it to recover. Just profit taking this morning. could melt up the rest of the day tbh but well see. idk if itll go green though
Its fucking retarded we cant talk about it.
More like eod
I hope so 
Gains are gains bro
If we get 27 I'm gonna nut
If no one sells it can only go up.
$30 end of day

Never get out of PLTR.
Yes holy fuck
Just a bb correction. Shes been on a tear since last week. I expect by mid day  shell be close to green
Same bro. Good luck
30!
$55 EOD. Praying for it
I'm about to sell my leaps and just go commons the iv is 90 something %


Can make just as much with shares I feel
It's a healthy correction. 45 support looks strong
I mean it went up like 8% a day for the last 2 weeks. 1 down day is probably needed
I imagine it's attracted a bunch of new traders who panic sold
overvalued possibly? thankfully this is the first time I ever successfully sold calls before the dip. I feel like a fuckin' genius tbh.
Also if I were you I'd hop on the PLTR train if you don't want that opportunity-loss.
Yes unfortunately, but it is a longish play so eh

Glad i entered with just 2k and didn't yolo more tho!

We had a fat wall at $21 and $23. This wall too will fall.
Same was true at 16
same watching my yolos get cut in half in value is not fun
you think holding till friday is the play currently sitting on 580 call for friday
Im buying like crazy. I HOPE this is a gift.  If not, Im fed!
Good question
Still think it's falling
Now probably pump and dump but it has potential in the long run for sure
Do a tiny bit of research outside of reddit.

PLUG is a good company. I'm staying away from fcel but it could still get memed up
solid stocks. they always come back from these pullbacks. it makes more sense to buy dips than buy in at the tops
Thats a funny way to it hahah.
20k and riding this train until I 30x my money
Not impressive if your net worth is $12
FSR retard
FSR? They got an upgrade by Citi. I think target $26? Also they had no movement on the last EV pump, it was annoying.
So that mean I should get a call
I bought aapl calls to meme as a joke and they're up 30%.
how do you report a stonk

Update: up 24% so far lol
5 shares :'D
I thought only people 50 years and over still use that
Im in
Same. 2nd place is still a podium finish.
Yeah thats what I loaded
That's what I'm about to buy.
right now
Quick! Buy more!
Easily my fav ticker atm
that's the one WSB should meme the fuck out on and get to become relevant
I was one of them
Same thanks tard!!
He's buying to bring down the Palantir! /phantom
Im not completely sold....I got in with 3K shares at 1.68 and feel like a fool for not selling yesterday at open for a 140% profit
CRSR
Pltr
LETS GO
Rips to 9 AM then dips. Then takes a lunch break and dips until 2pm, then it rips thru close lol
Honestly. I'd be drowning in Hookers if i didn't blow up my account in September
PLTR TSLA
someone already said this and I did, stop yelling at me geeez
Its on sale bro - this is the first day in the past month it is down and still hasnt reached Monday levels haha. Diamond hands
Boomers realized it isn't a gaming company like ATVI, but more like LOGI.  
  
On Monday they will forget, due to dementia, and buy it at fire sale prices back to $50
What dip ... so many of them now
>JMIA

is it gonna keep goin?
You seem like a reliable source dumping 2K in JMIA now
PLTR when it dips again.
Big Facts
Buckled in cptn
Yes sir!
Wtf do you remember that guy went all in on Kodak???
Lol. F will print, it's just the slowest gains known to mankind. There must be a law that it can't have 2 green days in a row
mars\*\*\*
I'm assuming because it had that 10.22 safety net and was trading right near there which means it was a "penny stock" in the eyes of the mods? Idk? That or just the shear amount of shilling seemed sus. Bit odd though.
Lmao only if you're cool with losing your shares
lol
Ive sold CCs the last two weeks and kept buying them back because of the insane appreciation. Sell cash (margin) secured puts instead.
yeah I'd say so. Worst case you just rebuy the shares
APHA CEO one of the worst so far, seemed baked. Sold.
He can't even afford a closet, look at all the clothes in the back
Fcel
For sure
Gapping up, good time to buy in
It is amazing how much money people will throw into something they dont understand
Wow what a moron. They're posting their portfolio screenshow as if it shows they aren't dumb, but they literally just a hit a lucky spike. I'm going to follow this acc b/c they'll be crying about a big loss soon
Jesus
Oh my god that can't be real
Feel like its too late to get in now:/
Don't ever sleep on NET
Yes and LI also
give symbols you tard I don't have time to google the scammers who stole my life-savings via email
The best salsa.
[deleted]
Hopefully. Gotta dump it before Friday
EOD 278

EOM 300
Link to crude stockpiles going down?
whats a good stock for lithium mining?
I dont think the EV bubble has popped yet
Not dead baby
That shit just said nah GO UP YA WHORE STOCK.

Lol
Yes. Fucking funny
WSB podcast?
After the 55k sells @26
Its up 8%.... its launched
This thing has been in a downtrend all year... I kinda wanna do this with you though
lol i sit and pee all the time at work
Bro, let our baby grow at its own pace. It'll hit 26-27 in no time.
You do realize the market is closed tomorrow and open only half the day Friday, yes?

Good luck either way. I yolo'd in today as well.
10/10 would recommend.
Get some Makers and sip. Or some Redbreast if you're feeling slightly fancy.
If you are mixing just get some Evan williams.
love makers mark, or wild turkey. woodford is also great too though
Absolutely. Woodford Reserve is always in the decanter. I'd also recommend Elijah Craig and Basil Hayden's.
Woodford is better than the garbage everyone else just mentioned
Bulleit but it's getting pricy

*Proceeds to drop $2k on an option for a company I just heard of yesterday.
Pump that 12% back, I should have sold yesterday 
i did but sold on the slightest rip, now all in ev spac like thic boi
Same
What did u sell
0.01% savings accounts

literally don't want free money
Honestly stupid af. Save enough for emergencies but it's 10% average yearly return if you just plop it in SPY
Into their student loans
Ew
I just bought 200 shares
I'm thinking about closing my 12/24 $600 $700 and $800 and buying back in Friday morning or Monday but I'm too afraid of another spike
50 EOY
fuck, is SPCE back ON THE MENU BOYS?
Some dipshit called spce on fast money last night and look 9% god damn. Dont sit on chamath palihapitifuckia
"I was not the best because I killed quickly. I was the best because the **crowd** loved me."
Nobody is onboard that rocket yet. Bought Jan $30 calls around $22 
Yes just hold CRSR is the play
Maybe next week
Yes
What a run. 
15% return so far
You got this bro. You just have to remember the mistakes and learn from them. We've all made them.
Sq 300 by 2022
Same waiting on 1500
Hop un we mooning 
fuckin same I was up bigly on my $217 BA puts then got a work call and couldn't sell when i was up 50%
You screwed yourself over. First rule of TSLA is never sell TSLA
Sell...tesla?
Jumped on that 
How much are you up? Im up 64%
Im up 270% 
full retard, might just work
Does P/S even matter anymore dude
Too low IMO, we can reach 500+
All things P are the best 
Why
yeah I think itll bounce at the 270 to 272ish range. I have march calls but if it does that ill buy some shorter exp to flip
Congrats homie
11/27
This has been in my head since I bought PLTR too
Both these gonna keep going up. We gonna show the strength of 1.6M tards
Every time
Happened to me too fml
$GSX

$TLRY was a good example in 2018 when it IPOd...they floated an absolutely tiny portion of the shares and the ownership structure was goofy, seemed like a strange thing to do.  Obviously it worked out for the insiders!
welcome to tendie town
Welcome Squirrel, pretty soon youll be picking out what color lambo you want when this baby goes to 70+
No regerts
roll in to closer expiry
160% is weak brotha.
Oh fuck yes

Holy shit, thats a candle
Whats the news?
QQQ
Most of them?
Maga
Its about to pass rn what ya mean soon! 28 EOD.
28+
28
Fuck EOD - any second now
dunno man, need it to get back up to 90 by mid December. Hoping their big health subsidiary IPO will help us out
Agreed monica. Nobody goes broke taking profits
Forget about that shit bruh that mindset does nothing for ya. Take your gains and move on to the next play.
Yup
Salesforce the new Oracle. Buying up all the things
Wow finally good news been holding that bag since 41$.
Thats big
Manipulation, I think after next week theyll let it run
Profits is profits bud
I did too and Im kicking myself in the ass for only making 175% profit
Never a truer word spoken.
Exploring my rim. Wish Tim Apple would get in on the rimming. We know hes good for et.
Up 4000% today. Fuck whoever had them
Ibio
Salesforce buying them rumours
salesforce acq
Some might say it even loses value over time.
Based
35
Think of a number that would make you laugh if someone else said it. Thats the number. 

For me thats 60
$30. It will correct at some point. 

RemindMe! 1 month
Ikr
Everyone and their mothers are buying them
because theta gang thinks they can play us for small percentage   
its okay we woudnt have options if it wasnt for theta 
because WSB has their hands all over this stock.  

Implied volatility is high.  

Time to sell some puts or calls instead of buying them!
100% 
i made 100% on it like 10 mins after open and i didnt know what pltr stood for until like an hour ago... so yea ur pretty gay
Stop spamming
Definitely!
HOLD it is on its way up
Please don't buy more.
should of bought at 9.30am

Yeah Jesus lol from pennies to loke $400
Only 91 somehow
You just can't talk about what mods don't want you to talk about. Mods here are the worst of any subreddit I've seen
Thanksgiving pump retard
Buyback Monday bb
Hold till Friday
dont sell. We have a half day Friday and its going to be a flurry to the upside.
Dump cancelled
Hope you're right. Loaded up on 60$ 1/15/21 at open this morning
It is time for 11
There was some great DD on why this was a bad play long term. Short term gains might be available though
Ya hard to go in on something that is up much lately.  Iv is prolly insane too
Ceo is german
Thanks for reminding me, been waiting on this one to dip
I hoped off with 200% returns like a little bitch, but time will tell whether i was stupid or not
Lol
Was watching that but never hopped on, any reason why they shooting up?
They need poors to work the jobs of these companies
Only up
Delta > Theta
I dont think so bro. I was down 30% in the hole yesterday after the dip and my 12/18 25c still rocketed market open.
Never
No its about to take off
nope, they are still selling them.
Ill buy
Idk, I got out. No regrets.
Yep. Thats the way
Good idea
Buy the dip?
KEEP PUMPING
Buy more ... and more ... and more
Yeah same. Shit wreaks
RIP?
The WSB way! Rip maradona :(
Not a dip like it looks like
I wish I put in more. Already up so much. Porn to me, but not by WSB standards. :(.
the big three
Sounds like too many positions.
PLTR man thats all you needed
 This is the way 
don't know but im letting my 1/15's ride
Don't talk about it
agree. cant wait to dump these bags
Knees weak bags heavy  
Is that you Mr. Krabs
there is no story!  that's the beauty.  you can't knock this stock because nobody knows anything!  god I wish I had piled in yesterday.  but actually some analyst pumped it on CNBC Monday.
PLTR
$16,097 up today as of this second (most of it from PLTR) and its a bunch of leaps left over
Next TTD?
Sell and yolo into PLTR, best decision I ever made
How long have you need bag holding
When did you buy?
Nice
username checks out
Zoomer here feeling dead inside unless Im up at least 10%
Have fun with your gaming gear...

It hit it's true valuation at $47. There will be mass profit taking
Software I thought ev company? Unless you mean software for ev
The only thing that could be bad if its business practices which soros hates, actually end up being crimes.
Yup
If only we knew
Gamestop isn't a horrible idea.
If that's all it's not too difficult buy a dip OTM
street corner for 3-4 hours and you -might- make it
account not at a million yet (could have been if I had the balls to go all in on some plays but too chicken)
if you're bored during all this madness, don't know what to tell you man
Why
$30 EOW, easy.
Friday for sure
I really hope youre right, 25c 27c and 28c right now
Give it time honey
I sold at 26.15 and thats what Im thinking

Youre gucci

This is just getting started
What colour? Cant decide here
PLTR is great but mgni providing huge gains too. congrats chief
Same here. Oh well
Clown. Buy PLTR 30c 11/27 with 3k and watch it X5
This is the way
The SEC wants to know your location
This guy has all figured out.
30% minimum come on man
Whatd you buy?
Eee according to my charts, PLTR left SPCE behind
Fuck spce, dont shill that piece of shit here.
no
NO BUY
No
>Too late to buy some more PLTR shares?

buy the intraday dip if any
Buy near the money leaps not shares bruh
Noooo all speculation this stock wont stop till WSB says soo LMAOOO fuck MMs
YES 
YAYAYAYAYAYAA
Done

The power of belief my friend.  
We can meme anything to the moon, if we believe!
Whole sub is gonna get new consuls
it might hit 30 today, no clue what happens after that
No reason to sell until you see a correction
Holding for life
IMO big firms are gonna short it before the Holidays
You could have bought CIIC and make 3.3x your money in a week... hindsight is 20/20.
You had no way of knowing dude. It could have tanked to < $10 instead like all the other meme stocks
Nothing serious here 
Dont beat yourself up bro. Have fun and roll with it. You only live once..
I bought 4 mins ago and Im up 20%
Yep
yesterday yes. today yes. tomorrow, yes.
Buy it all
EOH

FTFY
Lets goooo
Bleh
Fuck bro me too i always paper hands my calls man FUCK I HATE STOCKS
i've missed out on huge gains cause i was waiting for a pullback
u know u only have like 5 hours total left on those right?
No. We dont pull back or pull out here.
Not yet
Dipping toes into puts 
IPO'd in October, world's #1 AI. Possibilities are limitless, truly. $200 comes to mind but i'm fucking retarded. We really don't know, just know it's dirt cheap rn.
I sold 7 and if this holds they are all getting called away.
Neither of those matter any more
Surprise share offer = bullish. Look at TSLA.

Ill buy their fkn surprise shares.
I dont know if Andrew left would dare messing with the CIA
Remind what 1.) and 2.) means again
Sorry for your loss

Dont sleep. I think a ripper is coming if you look at the candles
If you buy a call the MM on the other side will buy 100 shares to hedge. So 7,000 option buys would move 700,000 shares.

There are 1.6 million users. Were not the direct volume, but its possible this sub is driving the pump.
Oh man i would be shitting my pants. Good luck

I jumped on the 12/4 30c grenade after reading 10k posts a day. I hope it doesnt blow up on me
Ive been doing the same but for 4 months, after a while I dont get mad I missed out because it happens so often, I just tell myself I wouldnt have bought anyway
Idk this is kinda some low volume shit. Can easily go down whenever the big money decides to dump it.
I learned that back in April.
4 months watching market open to close and never bought anything, maybe someday Ill buy something 
let them be, also if they end up losing the money they will blame you
Some people are just scared, plain and simple. Gotta take some risk to get ahead but some rather stay in their bubble.
just bought some $8 1/15 calls. Seems like it bottomed and there is only one direction it can go
Rope
Buy 7 k worth of pltr
did you short everything?
Are you not playing PLTR?
how
You gay? How you lose that much bread the last two weeks? All the homies been making money man. Maybe hang it up?
Take 2k buy PLTR 30c 11/27. 

Take 5k and buy MGNI 25c 12/18. 

Thank me later
Go away gay bear
dump that aapl brah
$80 after a 2:1 stock split
$80
who cares.  Make money now
TTD buyout in 2021 all stock deal
And closed tomorrow
enough time for  PLTR to hit 40
Lol if you think Pltr is a random stock.  There was tons of DD at IPO that told everybody to buy.
selling at 26 was the call, but buying back at 25 was the second part of that play for maximum gains.
or 28. We still have nearly 3 hours
28...29....
Imagine selling at 40
Sold at 27.10 expecting a dip to get in again, except the dip never came
Markets closed
Next week baby just hold the line
When the market is closed? Yes.
You may want to rethink what is "ridiculous", seeing as $35 could be Friday
Ouch
Buy PLTR 30c rn.
[deleted]
Take a step back and look at charts and see where you made a mistake. Write these things down. If you cant get learned and perspective out of the mistakes this may not be for you.
Market is closed tomorrow and has a half day on Friday but yeah might print
Why market is closed tomorrow
I have fucking 13 
What time does it close? 2pm EST?
PLTR knows youre talking shit, youre on their watchlist now.
Who needs short term profits when the government secures your revenue for decades.
Who knows what the hell is a bank reserve anyway and why is the stock market at all time highs during the worst pandemic in 100 years can anyone help
Blame India
So glad I tossed it for PLTR
now PLTR to $38 EOM
Those poor bears
Why

All of them
More like yacht rental even if you bought at the low.
Yacht club is no longer accepting applications.
1
Probably not even 1 tbh
MGNI
whats your % return on that
sell and roll up to $40s.
I sold 3 PLTR weeklies yesterday to buy a 100 shares like some sort of cuck. Honestly disappointed with myself. Thankfully I still have monthlies and leaps.
It is now lmao check it
Ill buy whatever meme stock we pump for ps5s
The 28 call I bought today at open was 2.20, now 6.40
me too i shouldve bough the fucker back at $200 now i gotta use $700
Id take pltr behind the nearest dumpster right now
I thought pltr was an ev
its gonna keep pumping till january
I sold this morning at a loss lol
And to make it even worse I bought weekly puts yesterday now down 80%
Theres a couple retards here
Im up 100%, will hold 3 years mate
Holding 30 30c 12/4
I'm just going to hold until it breaks $1000 at least
you have cmps?
Same boat with my 25c 2/19/21. Not sure what to do
EOM
My 580c really hopes so!
Good ol Tesler. Seems my 590s will print

I'm getting out for holidays but I don't know if that's the right move. Gains is gains
PLTR is a little prankster
Which numbers?
But does it really matter?
As if any of these fucking numbers actually matter 
Gay bear with spy 362p. Checking in
Got jack in a boxs number?
If lucky, could hold 23 and push upwards
$9.35 :)
Damn son that's pretty good!
50 shares at $9.60 and another 150 at $12.37!

Question: why get off?
You don't get off PLTR... PLTR gets off on you!
I have been asking myself this question today... I feel like today will be rocky. but I must holddddd
Yesterday after 200% gainz
Under 1 billion market cap kangaroo thread
Yea, still holding strong
Hell fucking yeah. I cant imagine anyone thinking Hmm, i think Im going to pass on cheap shares of an upcoming data cloud, tech giant and buy 2 shares of Amazon
This is the way.
Huh
did I miss another hit piece?
Its the buying opp theyve been waiting for. See you at 60 

Why wouldnt people want to hold shit over the weekend when the market will probably be up bigly Monday?
ur baba got wrecked over night
Its not a dip if this is the new high
69 is the best position
Good boy
People who say kings buy gas station sushi and kodk calls
It likely hangs around 23/24/25 ... lots of media coverage yesterday after close. And a dip opportunity....
Mmmmmmmmm :)
yep, think well see baba at $300 eoy
Biden is going to think he's meeting with Mao though...
Biden about to be Christopher Robin for a day.
Are markets open Thursday? Half a Friday? Fuk
Cashed out some PLTR gains to buy the PLTR dip
buying stuff with gains is the way to stay poor
I built myself a new gaming PC with CRSR components with CRSR gains. It's like a circle.
EV Monday: +20%

EV Wednesday: -7%

WSB: Abandon ship!!!
And lots of people in this sub would STILL lose their shirts over that move.

Thats how decoupled from reality *they* are.
Then buy puts pussy
Lgvw good too
What if I told you it wasn't actually a meme stock...
Hedge funds don't invest in NIO. Memers on the internet do and they are dumping for PLTR 
Btfd
No your not and no one is autistic enough to buy that.
well done, bravo
U rich pig
I just did 
Yes
Keep both
i think yes (im not in either)
duh
I would if I were you.
Yep, 1000 more shares on margin
its in bold so it must be true
Bless
I need that shit to go back up. We were doing so well but opened in the grave
buy more
I'd say profit taking after a fucking INSANE month long run up.

^(But IDK I'm retarded.)
Idk but Im buying the dip
Every stock needs a pullback or it would be very suspicious
Im full on bull with massive testicles but theres no way that the market lets this keep running the way it has for 3 weeks. I may be wrong tho this is some meme power
as long as you get some good loss porn out of it, i guess...

i say this knowing full well that i'm jacked to the utter tits in PLTR, calls and shares, and that this could very easily not go my way.

may the diamondest hands win.
I'll ask my wife's bf
Is that popular now or something? Most ppl say cuck in a derogatory sense
Thats the goal 
This is the way
Are you going to be sad when it doubles by February?
Good move, now buy 35C for January
old news bro
old news
gotta wait until tomorrows 10 am to buy the new low. Oh wait... Friday!
there is no bottom when YOU ONLY GO UP
This is the way

You still are. This is not going to last forever

I bought yesterday and thought I fucked up
I felt so smart selling at 26 before that little dip this morning.
Why did you SELL at all homo
Not to late
You can always start wheeling it Theta Gang style.
I remember shittalking that other one who was proud to have sold yesterdays top.

I said: "Why would you miss out todays +10% day?"

Turns out I was wrong, it's actually a +20% day.
imagine everyone talking about this over thanksgiving and then buying on friday

this thing's still got plenty to go
Same
The paypal mafia will make it legal
They will make it legal
Nope, who?
How is life with downs?
How. please explain
How?
Me too
Today please!
did..you...buy puts on PLTR?
Is going to 40 so load up
Money is money
YESP
Friday I guess
take it eod, you dont want to hold it during thanksgiving and we're only til 1pm friday.
I would be too if my wife was cheating
Such as?
Heads up life doesnt get any easier lol
Smell like bitch in here
Wat do you have in red?
Bro go enjoy your 20s theyre so short
Probably cause why the fuck not
Thats actually a pretty good play.
Am tempted by this. IVs still insane though
Dont worry I just bought more, expect it to turn around straight into the ground now 
How tf is +7% a dip
I bought some 100c
I wouldnt buy any dips until Eod. Sell off prior to holidays is imminent. Buy it then
No
Counter reference: TSLA, NIO, CRSR, literally forever
I'm out because stock is making too much too fast. What an absolute retard lol
No. 100+ next year!
IT DIPPED BUY NOW
no
Get in this last dip.
No
maybe
Nope. Hop in for 40 EONW
No.
This is the way
thicc boi
/r/pennystocks
lol
I just did this. Godspeed sir
Bears mad [x24]
easy
Why you gotta ground me homie
Every small baby dick Red dildo gets immediately followed up by a Hulk cock


 easily the literal THICC BEE.


All gas no brakes

 the promised tendies


NKLA

PSTH, hold till January. Minimal downside risk, huge potential. Just make sure to buy in multiples of 9
Tsla
Pltr
If you don't want to lose money, WCAGY or NKLA
Yes unfortunately, mods have banned. We refer to ourselves are Tuscan raiders and the stronk as  or 
Apparently all SPACs are PnDs
what investigation news?
meanwhile Elong is singlehandedly carrying us to mars and beond
But their legs are blown off sir
The curse of Jimmy chill will pass
Sounds like they are what everyone has been talking about tho.

Two Real Estate companies who just spun up an EV Company just to milk the hype.

How many other of those are out there and we don't know of the investigation yet?
NBAC is up 15%
Theres a bunch that arent.  NBAC, PSTH, GMHI are just a few.
Its down .80 lmao
Passive money is buying dont worry
Hope it stays
Its a stock. It will be traded today.

Back up once you retards realize its not being investigated
Buy the dip. The investigation has nothing to do with NIO and is actually good news for the legit competitors.  This shit will always rally back just like yesterday
- EV stocks all +1000% this year

- eV RUn HaSnT EvEN stArTeD!
Yeah its because youre here
Yeah day before almost a 4 day weekend idk why ppl didn't see this coming
I heard Mc Donalds makes EV now.

ALL INTO $MCD
That would be great.
Stop trying to make fsr happen
HCAC/Canoo > Fisker. Just look at their CEO, he even looks like a mad scientist with a 5head
Pltr, lower price and more volume
Stop reading my mind.
Safe bet, thinking the same thing
Crsr
ask Luckin coffee buyers how buying the dip on Chinese stocks work out.
What EV investigation?
oh damn nice 

good indicator on the status of the stay at home bubble lol
My calls would appreciate that
Bro, you forgot a zero
You mean 24.50
Dec 22
delusional NIO bagholder here! I found one!
eventually people will get the vaccine. I still think we're going to have masks though because a lot of people won't get it for months or even ever.
People get the flu even though they get a flu shot, I get for majority it works but I know for a fact Im not getting a vaccine fuck that.
Battle to sell highest?
yeah thats what I was  debating, not very many dips looking a the last week
Mods are gay
Below 1 billion market cap
Theyre coming for our tendietown  they dont want none to have it hun
Theres no learning, its literally luck. Selling early with profit is the only way to make consistent gains
The magic that is the USA
Stimulus money
What did you do?
I would not be holding any retail through this Black Friday
You do know that JWN market cap doubled in 2 weeks, right
Pump it daddy!!
Youre able true hero! When it hits 35 you have my permission to sell!
Thank you sir
I know this is WSB and all... but get shares.
Decent entry point for shares and going long?
Agreed. Sold for 400% profit. Want to renter and everything is expensive af.
Way too expensive
whats going on with this thing lol
be patient. it'll come back with gains on top very soon.
But Cramer said stay away
at this point I started selling some AAPL AMD and MSFT to invest in meme stocks. no regrets so far
Lol this just signaled to me that I need to hold my 1/15/20 30c
It's optimistic but if it does we'll both be swimming in tendies.
i heard maradona was autistic

if that's true he's basically one of us
Fuck yea brotha
Well the government pumped the markets. If the fed did not, it would have drilled like no other. They also gave out trillions to Americans to spend.
So 6 weeks to recover in next crash?
Got nothing better to do
Have you ever heard of Occupy Wall Street?
The 2008 crash took the housing market with it. This crash in 2020 was different.
Congrats!
Congrats
Lol congrats bro. 400% gain is a phenomenal return
[deleted]
throwing all profits into the 
got in MGNI last week. we just getting started. compare it with TTD.
Reason?
Price target?
What? Stocks don't go down silly.
Take your negativity to r/investing.
Hell it could drop 15% and still be up 35% for the week, 170% for the month!
The only direction it would correct is upward
I bought a Tesla call Oct 2019 for $250, and sold for $310 two weeks later. I thought I was the shit. Its worth $170k now...
Shouldnt have sold it
That SWE job allowed you to put some $$$ into PLTR. Unless you lucked out with OTM lottos.
That hasnt worked this month
VXX Calls?
Famous last words
Risky af bro
Whats your position
Stop!!! I can only get so erect!
I just cancelled my limit sell for 30.  Reset for 40. 
Greed is good-Gordon Gecko
Kk weve hit the top Im buying puts
meme stock = moon
no i think you may be right, im super bullish on PLTR but for it to rip this hard must be some news coming or
something
WTF sells PLTR. We already know how to beat this game.
I jumped in when my roomate jumped in.
$30 in 60 seconds bro.
Try $30 in an hour from now
EOD
Funny, how suddenly everyone does their DD when the stock is already more than 100 percent up in 10 days.
DD doesn't *cause* stocks to go up unless it's a low cap P&D (under 1bill).
Source?
My 31$ calls this am would really like that
Hodor
what was considered stupid expensive?
Just gonna be dumb luck. Whoever has the balls is stupid
I don't think there's gonna be one. It'll lay flat after this rise and everyone still holding calls will get IV crushed. Those selling calls (probably 40c) will make bank.
Already made bank riding it up this whole time.
Got into a (small) short position 5 minutes ago 
wait...PLTR can go down?
Especially makes sense if they want to maintain reputation that benefits NIO, which they back.
Nio is also backed by the chinese government...they are just thinning out the competition
I look at this like a good long term thing. Helps solidify confidence on the sector. Idiots on here screaming 'China EVs another LK!'.... I don't think any of the CCP wants that to happen. Step 1 in China is don't piss off the CCP.
Regulation is bad. Especially when an all-powerful communist government is doing the regulating. Not sure how its possible to be this retarded.
Yesterday was some of the largest volume pltr has seen. In its brief history, it pulls back after having a large volume Green Day. This is expected. Set your stop loss for 20% just in case, but I doubt it falls that far. It will recover next week
This is the way
Lmao what a name
They are investigating 2 companies that have nothing to do with NIO and xpev so I don't understand why people are selling off like bitches
Source?
They're investigating Evergrande... the property developer for EV companies, not the EV companies.

Stupid post.
Sure
Good one
Wow. Normally theyd have that as an online training or something. Is it like a group discussion?
calls on zoom
Whats that suppose to be a joke cause thats not funny asshole
today's top is tomorrow's bottom
appears to be for now
Dont fret, that's what I thought yesterday and now I'm up
flair checks out
Good luck. You're stuck for a week at least. Markets letting off steam for next 5 days according to investors
PLTR bears
People with ev calls?
Common sense
When today or Friday? When go buy good sir or madam
Why did you wait so long?
What's it like to lock in guaranteed gains like that?
I waited until fking yesterday to finally cave in. Ur not late to the party.
Hold till 2022. Retire.
God damn man we get it. Stfu. Literally post every single minute in all caps. Go jerkoff or something and stop spamming you retarded fuck
Ban this retard please
PLTR BABYYYP
Same
Did the same, crazy!
I wonder if it's sector rotation out of evs into batteries
Now why do u say this?
Joes the worst by far. He has no clue and just says crap to fill time. Sorkins opinionated but not bad, covid made him stray too far away from market talk and more into political/ethical journalism
Sara Eisen, frank the gay real estate guy, joe kernen are worse. Miss morgans jugs, dont know if shes coming back. Halftime and fast money only good hours
Worst and acts like COVID is Ebola.  All about shaming people for doing anything
Roblox.
Thicc bee
CLNE
Its red enough that it could suddenly go super red out of nowhere, or even worse stay flat all day.
thats what you get for doubting elong
Nio leaps and 0dte puts.
Rip
Sir, this is WSB. Your analyzing is unnecessary here
We heard you like dips to buy more, so here ya go, fella.
Can still get in at open. Not too late.
This- also a little below the the 8 day moving average if its trending up
A 15% drop on PLTR in two days? Sorry fam, I dont see that happening
I sold a 20p so that would be great if I could get assigned at 20 but I just dont see that happening. Unfortunately.

I believe you may be correct. Stop limits are in place.
Seriously some of these no name hype plays with 0 sales have been going like 200%
Doubtful

Would you rather go from 540 to 600 or 20 to 100?
TSLTR
BOTH
Turns out it was JPM manipulating the price of gold all along
How does this relate to NIO and XPEV though?
lmao. but seriously over 45 is super bullish.
Please let it be Iran. I want Donnie to show the world what he's been capable of this entire time. And so I can buy LMT calls for whatever ensues.
You have a boyfriend?
... like catching a falling knife almost
Shares or leaps for that one
Pretty much.
Few bears are gay year-round.....
Let me know how you make out, that's on my 15-year old's Christmas list.
Yea... thats how you make money. Pigs get slaughtered
Sounds like a depressing way to live life
there's some. but they are really fucking spiteful and cranky. not even worth talking too. I guess I can understand why after this year really fucked them in the bare ass.
Tried it for about 6 months. During a global pandemic. Would not recommend.
If I dont sell today, Ill become negative on Friday
Itll bounce back, dont trade on emotions
Stay you donut, its the biggest Chinese EV with actual EU expansion plans, theyre not going to disappear
Should've taken profits over 50. Stay at this point, this is just a speed bump, not a stop sign.
Stay, why would you sell?
Take profits on half if possible and let the rest ride.

Looks like the EV hype my die just before turkey day.
No, only what it opens at.
Wait til Friday my dude. Itll be a low volume day today. Fridays are usually good days to buy calls.
Bought calls on amzn and zoom yesterday!
zoom is zooming now
Roll over to 12/18s
I have 11/27 280c

If I hold its going to tank to 270, if I sell well moon to 290. Im fucked either way
Markets go up, markets go down, you cant explain that!
What was the scare
You know the routine.  Trump mentions the Dow you sell.
Smoke a blunt and make your own November high
I was getting close too lol Im fucked
I know that bears will always be in shambles.
TSLA Dip
Waiting for dumpers from yesterday
How fucked are we?
I looked into that but it didn't think it was profitable

Thinking of getting a synthetic call or should I just go naked call
Closer to merger
Gotta have some big balls to trade futures..shit had me buying shares like a boomer after a week of losses.
quick q on that. How much do you need to start trading mES? Like if I want to start an acc
I'm gonna try to snag cheaper 2021 calls.
Hopefully -5% painful
I was just looking at those calls, it seems like a play. Plus I been going there like every day since they opened up near my house.
Should buy AAPL instead.
Im a simple man, I see APPL and I downvote.
Positions?
my mother says to get a job but she don't like the one she's got

NKLA shit the bed the day it was allowed to IPO

To buy the fucking dip!!!!! GOO!!!!

Recent IPO - looks like the next NIO
Heres the deal, RH for my trading, other tools for analysis.
Fr dude at this point my fucking monkey brain is like hurr durr green app good red app bad and it makes me feel something for once.
yeah if you have 400k and make anmodest 8% per year thats $32k
Youll have to wait 10 years to actually see significant gains lmaooo
I know someone who can live off the dividends from a single stock that they own. Pretty crazy.
VTI, but yeah
Stocks don't pay interest, they pay dividends if they feel like it, or maybe youre referring to the fact that they tend to appreciate. But yes people do that.
Yeah it's called FIRE. Financial independence retire early. Look it up

So many penny pinchers on the sideline need that 1% dip before theyll jump in. Theyre gay but theyre protecting our downside lol
As long as they take spy with it.

Got shares, I can hold
We alright
You sly dog, you had me monologuing
Aaaaaaand it's gone
Lol man, i think you need to layoff the st0nks. Sounds like you need the money tbh... I mean that in the nicest way possible
Thats smart af but also retarded
Too bad i already had calls, ffs fucking hate it when that gay shit happens
NEVERMIND LETS MAKE THAT 30
at this point? 26 is a safer bet lol!
Its like having a fuel tank of gas
Do a trailing stop and stop worrying
stock was undervalued, itll probably get to 40 by EOY easily
Scared of what? Only making 170% instead of 200%? Chill
Hold. Dont be the guy who sold sq leaps at $100 lol
Dork.  Whyd u sell?
imagine if those had been calls :(
Sell and buy further out
Pltr only goes up my dude
Same here
If I had bought monthlies instead of LEAPS a month ago I would also be a millionaire.

Jan 2022 PLTR $12.50C.  I paid $2.50 for them.  Now they've done well, don't get me wrong, but if I had bought 100 monthlies instead of 10 LEAPS, I'd be legitimately rich.
Its a good ass company  way better than the other meme stocks
I hope so. Got some cheap calls a while back that expire in late December
Sources?
10:30 dip days are over
same
If it's just barely above 18.50 you could take the money and just do a buy/write on Monday to get your shares back and open a new cc. As long as it doesn't moon over the weekend it'll probably work.
treat yourself man 
Hold like a mofo
A ton!
If youre not Fomoing into pltr your fomo sensors are off
What?
Wdym
BABA always lets us down
Looks like people selling at 26
up 150% this month jesus give it a breather
TSLA is so last year, I say.
I hope so
Buy more PLTR calls to hit 25k and you wont have to worry about that 
ur retarded but prolly fine maybe
nah you can afford a fucking now
It's on sale. Gettem while they're hot
I have a monitor with dildos just for  BABA
My fault, I bought in yesterday.
45 support seems good, might fall to 40 at the lowest and then will probably resume growth at a healthier rate.

Net is so safe. jumps and holds position for months without major dumps.
It was such a tease going over $70 after earnings and then....nothing. Maybe I can save some of these dead calls.
Id love to know
If you are talking PLTR, 25 IS the dip
stock go down like your bitch on my dick, then its a dip fuckboy
So happy I sold my weeklies while it was over $11 yesterday.

Welcome to modern day investing
It's the internet bro. How can it go tits up
565
friday. markets open just for a bit tho
You can hold, but they will lose value the closer you get. If you're green today, take it.
If they are no where close to being itm by eod, get rid of those bad boys
Be careful of time decay. Market close tomorrow.
you can hold into friday. but you gotta excersise or sell early.  and if there otm ur kinda fucked.
Give it some time, there are a LOT of bagholders with DKNG means that it isn't going to immediately break price levels like it would if it was in clear blue skies for example
yup, doubled down on the dip today as well, going to $300 eoy
Ive got some 4/2021 300c, seems like the move
Yeah not even meme. Even after it hits ATH again I'm not going to sell my ~$150k of shares, that shit can sit there for the next 10 years.
The BABA entry was 11/18
Yes daddy
Thinking of buying some more today. When do you think it'll be lowest today?
you expect it to break through? i was going to wait for a dip to jump in
Keep talking! I'm almost there!
Curry don't like baba, rather
And girls
disagree, looks like profit taking and consolidation to me
The second theres volume itll hit 11

I got in too early in the dip at 45 ffs I think itll be ok in some time

App or web?
PLTR
Couple pltr 12/4 27c

LPL just busted through a triple top and year long resistance.  It's a slow mover but it's headed for $9+
1 call on some of the meme stock dips today. You need more cash to gamble and lose with the big bois though.
Ugh. Fine, a real answer too. I am genuinely excited about lgvw... and I hate that I found out about it through this sub because I feel like I can't trust my instincts about it, lol. 

But this pay day, I'll dump even more into it. Maybe all of it if it's still sub $20.
PLTR 11/27 $26c is only a dollar
Same here boss. Even my hedge spy put is even lmao. Fawk
I did! Never owned it before
Didn't realize there were so many paper handed CRSR holders. Smdh
fundamentals mean nothing now

Been scooping up little bits of JD during sell-offs. Shit is going to be massive next year.
Hey - thanks for the heads up - sounds interesting! Will pick up some JD calls!
Price upgrade by shittty bank
bull flag I think. Moon mission is still on.
Just have to time it right. I just pulled 10% from DAL in five minutes.
I'm selling for PLTR, sorry bro
Vix
GRWG has been solid for the last month and has room to keep going.
If it makes you feel any better, I wouldve turned 4K into 105k had I not sold early
Then blow down
Straight up does not give a fook
Shut up and buy calls. 
Stupid bears.
You forgot that Uber eats will deliver the food to the people just like before.
They are already selling off malls for a fraction of what was paid for them. The commercial real estate economy will collapse, this will ripple all the way to the state tax incomes. For states which already hold massive deficits. Itll be brutal..... like... brutal.
This has been going on since March. A ton of the cafes and restaurants around my office are no more. What was left of main street is dead. But Starbucks will keep their stock price up with buybacks financed by cheap Fed money.
Starbucks already sells coffee pods in supermarkets, that will just grow.
If we blast through 50 resistance we'll be unstoppable weee
Motley fool pump

Yur what I have 5 buys

You literally cant lose with them...Ill pay that premium every time

That kind of boomer thinking only matters for profitable companies with a track record
Its a Christmas Miracle
Love me some henny
You think we will get a good catalyst before 12/18? I FOMOed into the only EV that didn't go on a massive run. Maybe some merger news perhaps
60 Friday
the market cap is currently 4.2B with a revenue of 1.2B per year that keeps increasing, so honestly 100$ is possible in the next months
$2000 a share after a 10 for 1 split next week.
100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

You're throwing money away at that strike. 90c is much better.
Yes not working for me
Yes, f'n super annoying
Hold that shit
Diamond hand
Welp i can say with the ut most confidence... selling the 50x $20 calls i bought on monday.... at tuesday open... was the second biggest regret of my year.
lock and roll out to leaps
this is the way
Im in all meme stocks and Im up 80% all time. I didnt buy weeklies but I should have
Only if you're buying warrants not shares right?
a hooker, bottle of bourbon, and cocaine
PLTR calls, 12/18 pick a strike
APHA, SBE, or PSTH
60 TSLA 11/27 $690 calls
CVS or CODX
I agree with the ticker but we calling 2 weeks out a leap now?
How long does it last for?
TSLA 600 eod
Reload further out
Probably, once its that in the money it doesnt grow as fast. Might as well sell and buy a new one w higher strike and expiry further out
sell 2 to get your cost entry back and let the rest ride!
Dont sell, I sold a 20c this morning and wished I hung onto it
Yes

Roll into OTM calls further away from expiry

Im holding 30s, waiting for the EOD fade to buy more
Hold lol
You are looking good my friend; Im at 25c 27c and 28c up 238%, gotta love PLTR, but i think PLTR still has some more in it
Sell
Take profit. Reroll into a longer dated calls.
bro keep riding it. I bought $25 Calls today and flipped them for double. You are in the money. Whats the worst that can happen? you only take 180%. Like thats not bad at all, for the risk vs reward keep playing
All the way up to the upper atmosphere. But not space.
Baba is just doing babas thing!
Yup. And BLDP will be $30.
stop selling garbage. Atleast buy semi-garbage stock PLTR and make like 30%

Same
Thats not possiblr

If it can hit $1500 a share once it can do it again
hell if I know but I bought more shares
boomers who bought at ipo
Narnia. They don't exist.
Good shit fam
I have no buying power and have a day trade restriction.

I opted for CRSR and PLTR instead long term.
Theyre punching air right now
Idk how i feel about this. Slight concern
I sure fuckin hope so

[deleted]
Lmao literally doesnt make sense. Im so pissed I was about to buy calls for WORK this morning but thought it ran out of juice for the week... fuckkkkk
Get your helmet on and get back in there
Id be surprised if it has much more steam in the next days
This is only the beginning
news?
trying to learn WSB.... are people just buying / sell options of calls / puts?
But y tho
Go balls deep in your hand Bitch
What sell off lmao
Thinking about some calls
Sold my 1/15 calls and put them into Apple  
Same wtf
I know - used it and was not a fan at all.
CRSR for life
It's priced into the contracts, basically plays as a 0d right now
bro what the fuck does that even mean just buy pltr calls the numbers and dates dont matter
They Buying slack
They want to buy WORK
buying WORK
This was beautiful
strike and exp recommendation?
Profit take and reinvest earnings into more calls...  PLTR is just going to keep climbing, but profit is profit
You're kidding, right?

Take profit in mid-late December when PLTR is at 45-50.
105% gain in the past few months
I am. and wtf
Very dumb get in CRM instead
This guy is now a millionaire 
There might be a thousand bagger for some of these weeklies.

Yes
I got shares. what strike and dates u got?
First they will buy Apple
+1 for riot and mara 

Idk why its taking people longer to notice this Shitcoin run

Edit: whoops I confused Mara and MSTR
IV is so high right now conventional wisdom would say shares would be smarter but conventional wisdom dont mean shit when you gain 15% daily
$26.99, who told this thing it could take a break
Are you a long holder or are you trying to flip it? Long holder youre good, tho try to get a good price. But if youre flipping it, itll really all depend on the sentiment that week
NO GO ALL IN
Don't you worry young padawan, there is no ceiling here

Fucking hell I never get 0.2 options that shoot up $100+ bucks lol
thinking wait till friday or hold knowing it may test 270
Sell the 12/4.  Hold the 12/11 for another week.  Or roll out.
Sell half or however much you need to get back initial buy in
Hold
Dont think anyone was in. That m&a came out of nowhere
And 100% green
100% PLTR here
Diamond hands. Fair value at 40
Would be cool if it would bounce back just like a lil
Theres no reason it wont continue to climb back up. Today made no sense but the gains do
pltr
Im in too, hoping for a run up into the NBA season
Thats how news works
Salesforce talks
Announcement of a possible merger with Salesforce.

At least 50

roll em, roll em, roll em.... til you're rawhide
ARKG. Everything else has ran so far so fast recently. I think innovation in medicine is gonna be a huuuuge rainmaker. The other ARK funds have more exposure to the bubble we find ourselves in now....
pltr
ARKW and ARKK
I invest in k, g and w, even though there is some overlap
Holding KW and KK
Im in G
Of all the ARK etfs, its actually been the genomic revolution thats being doing me a solid last couple months
> ARKW - Next Gen Internet.

ARKG - Next Gen Autist.
ARKG, let those autists decide on the genomics tickers. the rest i can do myself individually
have ARKK, ARKF, ARKW.

ARKW is best
From what I researched ARKK = top holdings of ARKG + ARKW.  Good combination would be to hold ARKK + ARKF
ARKG no doubt. Just buy the top 2 companies of every other share. Leave genomics for the pros to handle for you.
SO ANNOYING

I just want it to be known that I bought BABA 1/15 $305 C on Nov 6th EOD before it dropped to $250 and didnt panic sell

Then tell us more picks

There is no worthy alternative. Slack is the play to gain corporate communications and control of the various applications that corporate minions have to use. Microsoft has the next alternative and its trying to destroy Slack at all costs.
You could have just sent me $500

Tesla is always a good buy
Rollercoaster Tycoon. Get out buddy.
Kangaroo market
Hype and people falsely believing they are the next Tesla
Its a stock so it goes up. Thems the rules
I think all of the EV stocks that have been mooning are all losing money. Forget fundamentals or reason, just go with the trend.
Would help ya
People say to pay 50% 2 weeks from the due date and then the remaining 2 days before the due date 

I just pay in full when the statement comes out
Pay on it, but not all of it, so leave a little bit of debt on it at all time.
Yup pay in full every month and use it. I would throw all my gas on it or whatever got me the most cash back and pay it in full once the statement comes out
Its probably doing well
Im in. Gains arent stopping today. Still opportunity.
Bought 10x weekly 16c for around 500 yesterday, sold today for about 2000. Would have been 6000 if I held till now, but hindsight is 20/20.
They definitely flatten a bit during that time.
Do  shit in the woods?
yes
Buckle up and ride it to the moon
Same, I think it peaked and Im not holding over thanksgiving. Will get in again if theres a dip on Friday.
$450 in profit or 450 per contract Im dumb
It won't congratulations on making money
you'll be fine. its gonna run up to 28 then dip back down to the low 27's again and settle into mid 27 at close is my guess. you'll probably end the day up a few bucks, but not anything insane.
Isnt it already?
What exactly do you think its been doing? Its green everyday. Double digits most days.
I bought a few shares
Which India news? I missed out on the news
Oh its doing more than just touching it

20k in shares at the moment I'm confident il atleast double my money

bro this shit is insane lol i had 1k pltr shares at 18 and sold like a gaggot holy fuck
Realistic chances it breaks 30$ before next Friday? I am holding a truck load of 30c 12/4 and need to dump them
No shit
Dito. I expected a huge sell off (ok, the day isn't over). But there is always a next dip.
More like GREENdankulous

This is the way
Sold my feb $16c last week....
Lol thats me
Damn this is military grade autism.
sell them before expiry to get your extrinsic value
Broker sells itm for you when it expires. In an event that the itm becomes slightly otm during expiry, broker will sell so you barely lose money
Idk if youre trolling or not but Im gonna answer honestly. If you dont sell your options before expiration then youll loose it on the exp date unless you exercise them. It all depends on what the exp date is.
Got out this am. Im satisfied
God my dumbass was really looking at buying some 28c, and 30c for Friday and said nah that aint happening
Positive vibes from the sidelines
yes
Just do 60c while you are at it
I did and idk
why take profits when you can make double profits
nooooo we cant. Its forbidden by rule number 2 :D
I have shares at $11, I ain't selling shit.
Yea for sure. Need a massive crash to stop this

Lol no. Its just crazy.
then your puts for TSLA and PLTR are at .01
Normally Id say dont fight it, but PLTR makes me nervous today
Sell some, keep some. You can always buy back in if it dips but doesnt hurt to lock in some profits.
Worth riding the dip if it happens. I think it'd be worse to miss the rip in case dip doesn't happen.

edit: idk, do what you want, i don't want to sway you
Take profit you dumbass
JUMIA

Its not a loss until you sell
What are your positions?
get a cash account and keep track of how much cash you had the day before it's that easy fuck margin

Aunt jemima makes no damn sense
What is that like $6 US?
just buy the $15 Jan 2023s and relax, or don't and end up buying the $30s next week for the same price
Get yourself a bag of cheetos and powder up those fingers boy, you don't need them for your keyboard/phone anyway.
Lets go henny
Wanted to sell them at 10,20 because they were dead ass doing no good. Glad i hold them. Get that bitch to 15
Volumes still huge
Buy more sooner rather than later
Take the shares
Naked or covered
Like you shorted PLTR? I guess go cry and hope it dips so you can buy back.
Dont be stupid next time
What calls do you recommend
You hold this stock for years boy
I would sit on those lol
Basically literally forgot about them... even on bad days. The goal is to be so deep ITM
Another EV SPAC cash-in... company has zero revenue.
Ordered a new suppressor on my FSR gains today.
Oil up 30% this month. Which stocks will be biggest winners?
Oh shutttr up. Hold
You can exercise options?
Exercise then sell ccs
I would just sell man
Only regret is not buying more
[deleted]
Yep
to valhalaaaaa
40
Got both
570!
571!
Why didnt you tell us this yesterday?!?!?
Yessir
AMAT busy AF, steady rise
Come on $30 PLTR
What im saying, logic says its gotta dip a bit after a fucking 20%+ day

But in this market logic is out the window, so who fucking knows
It would be you and some other bears against full wsb retard strength + instos
can't wait

should be like 500 PS5s with the number or clowns getting rich in here this week
It's not a tumor just buy
CRSR was an obvious sell at 50. It is due for a correction to under $40.
Two words for CRSR my guy 

Cyber Monday
It will be green next week 
Careful youre going to get burned. That stock loves to sell off
Dont buy a shitty Black Friday model.
Good job. When did you buy it
Would you buy my left nut?
Pltr 30 eod
My penis might break
Already did. It's been going flat ever since. After sweet, sweet gains all week this is pain.
Did and regret it watching pltr continue lmfao
Lol thats like.... nothing
hes literally gonna need to own up by the end of this week lmao
Locked and loaded, Feb 100c and Mar 100c
They must hate money.
It is not breaking 20. It will go down to 18 eod.
I think this might be 1 you never sell. Like tesla.
NO
No!
Im absolutely selling at $30 and then waiting for the next dip for more calls. 

I mean, it will eventually dip, right? Right guys??
Im holding until I get hit by a truck or get picked up by a faster rocket to the moon
12/11 15P is cheap. Probably much cheaper than what I bought them for yesterday (.21) if I'm being honest...
That's a bad bet, betting against papa musk.
What do you got?
At least 30
420 duh
Felt retarded going all in at the start of november but now we shopping for lambos 
you just gotta claw ur way back in
I just bought in 30 min ago and doubled my investment
Mee too, each day I refuse to fomo thinking MM will crash it in the pre-market. Yet it doesnt. Oh well I aint buying today either
Gains are gains mi amigo
This would be absolutely glorious
Not before it hits 30
one with numbers and an expiration
hopefully, these degenerates cant stop
Im still waiting for it honestly. That shit is going to rip some faces off.
same. Took profits. No regrets. Better to take some profit then see that shit go red and still keep believing it will be green again. Been burned too many times. Learn from the mistakes.
More gasss
Pls stop watching crazy tv. Biden cannot shutdown anything. Jesus.
OK but why did you post this when futes, PLTR, and TSLA all red tho
Fuckin nerd
Cause every other time it formed a bull flag so far its flown immediately after
because you know a good thing when you see it
Because its the way
Cant never have enough
38
I hope so
It worked with the other one Ci - ic??
Strangest way Ive ever seen H spelled lol
Please tell me how thats not allowed but the swings with GME or AMC are. I dont care if theyre actual businesses, doesnt negate the fact their stock is pumped...then dumped.
If people aren't buying premarket, they probably won't buy at open.
Immediate buy and 
Puts? Yeah plenty have been buying since yesterday
Racist AF
if they don't recognize me then they're new
Im spy 220p gang
You werent there for the crash of 1929 like I was!
The sad part is even after the giant market drops, me thinking, "maybe MSFT will bounce back", up until 3/19 or so.
The turnover is huge here we lose thousands every week. Nobody even knows what $MU $90 means
Someone made a graph comparing VIX and the # of comments in the daily thread, they were proportional to eachother.
Yep it's hilarious. We were down below 15k active users during trading hours. During the late August pump we were over 30k. Back up to 26k now before the market is even open.
WWIII is still my favorite so far.
Spy 270p ftw
This made me laugh
Salty downvotes lol 
Or youd just have $1000.

Time is important here.
Someone did
100% buying Airbnb leaps. Buy on the dip and talk shit about it for like a month - then it becomes meme forever.
When is Airbnb IPO?
People said this about yesterday, still made bank on calls.
Literally cant go tits up
Does anyone care to explain why people were saying it cant go below 10 ?
They only have a signed LOI, so it's pretty early still. I tried buying some shares in premarket and for some reason can't get a fill right now.
A little sketchy? It absolutely fucking a blatant in your face scam. The way it was pumped in here was blatant as well. Hate to break it to anyone who invested but you literally may as well have sent their money to a Nigerian prince...
FSR up bigly too!
Duh
Exactly what I was thinking, gonna be a good day for some calls
Thank you for your charity
Down over 2k with shares 
I cant afford a line after today 
What a ridiculously cultured post for WSB.
Did you read that in them oolong leaves son?
Too many shoe shiners trying to short, actually.
RemindMe! If this isn't the start of the big dip I'm joining the discord.
There are no shoeshiners, only retarded bots and index funds now. If you have an ounce of discretion you are now driving trillion dollar markets
You know that dude traded on inside info his whole life and the shoe shine boy story was a joke, right?
Cause my KNDI has dropped like 20% over the last 2 days. 1/21/2022 so I can wait.
No its not
Remindme! 90 minutes
TSLA is down like 1% lmao wheres the violent pullback
Then why didnt you buy puts? You didnt know, so shut the fuck up
imagine making $MILLIONS off of these SPACs in less than a week...

then buying the dip - rather than following the trend to MOMO stocks

if we aren't buying tech for the incoming rotation - we really are autists
Yea just look at hyln. It just went for so many -10% days.
Yeah I have 1 , averaging down maybe
IV is up from the drop. Wait for a flat day
What are the regulatory risks considering neither president likes ? I have equity in BABA but I dont trust Ma nor Xi enough to take them up on that vacay opportunity to Xinjiang.
Here in Florida the furloughs are transitioning to permanent layoffs in huge numbers. We do have an unusually large amount of service industry jobs and they are getting slaughtered.
 about to be filing for unemployment...
I dont know if its made the news much, but rumor has it the pandemic is getting worse instead of better.
Better than my 12/31 calls
"wig split" is a phrase I haven't heard since like '95
idk and the market is only open until 1pm
its also the fact they are referring too S&P or Dow. many traders/gamblers never play the indexes so it's irrelevant.
The market did not have its best month since 1987. The DOW did. You made so little from it because you werent invested in shitty boomer stocks.
Past data adjusted for fundamental change shows what people are willing to pay for certain good aka stock in this instance
RIP ur $$$
Probably never with the amount of government contracts they will be getting
No investigation into in administration. PLTR can easily pay Hunter $1 million to fuck off
They provide an entirely different service ..
No
Learnt my first  lesson on pumps & dumps with this back in Feb. Too scarred to go in again even if it makes sense
Same, how low you talkin
This is the way
I cant wait until hes fucking out of here. Hes a curse on the markets
Ronbinhooders are awake buying the discounts
stimulus_hopes.exe activated
So bullish
Who gives a fuck at this point
Were you here in April/May? That shit doesnt mean shit.
Or negative 10%
Sammeee now Im just hard and horny and still autistic lets goooo
It's called a buying opportunity
Work hard buddy
The wrong kind of retard
Because you want bambos not lambos
Wait am I going all in on PLTR, RKT, or ZM?

Your hands are made of paper Huh?
Profit is profit.

If no then HOLD
27 EOD 
It already did..
lol fucking simp why didnt u buy at 24.50? Gotta be missing a few screws ..
   here too
40
My rational brain says 40-50

&#x200B;

But my retard brain says $169
I almost pulled the trigger on PLTR the other day. Too bad I didn't.
Yesssssssir
Do I get back in?
My tummy hurts
For a company thats looking at blanket billion dollar PO numbers from gov agencies? Nothing is too high. Are we just pricing in this year or are we pricing in future growth for 5-10 years? What if they offer this service to foreign friendly nations. The sky is literally the limit
you arnt
Til $40
The AI is trading itself
30 EoY is conservative
With our chromosomes combined we might hit 45.
Till forever
A lot of imagining hurts my brain
Thats what Im saying M00N B00T$ 0N 
Roll into DKNG
Sold NIO at 100% profit when it hit $51
Inverse this guy
Because you hate money?
\*crickets\*
Pesla
I used to be poor but NIO made me not poor so now I can buy even more NIO
It aint much but Im heading for my first +$1000 day. Feelsgoodman.jpg
It did, merger with sales force.
My awe of how Slack of all businesses got that ticker usurped me out of my call order going through 
Order your Lambo
It'll be 30 by end of year, only thing stupid is you weren't aggressive enough
Hasn't looked stupid yet
You'll be fine
Felt like my 12/18 $30 yesterday was stupid so who knows
Very
Stations are an earthly concept. PLTR already on moon and heading for Mars 
What dip?
3? lol are you poor or something?
You'll be green eod
long term hold
outta boi, that's the spirit     
this this this.  it has huge runway!!!!  30 is reasonable.  40 is totally justifiable when you compare it to The Trade Desk and apply it's multiples.
Got in at $5.50 - riding this thing for a while
GME.  Keeping adding pressure.
CRSR
Decent dip on LIT today although its a backside play on EV so you might not want that.
FUBO
Pershing Square Tontine making big moves soon
the premiums shot up 10x on the FDs, no meat on the bone like last week, makes me sad
Hype and bull is when you want to be in
Same. PLTR got me back into margin on Robinhood so Im happy. Pigs get slaughtered.
I sold shares for a 130% gain (9.97 cost basis) and rolled a quarter of the gains into 27cs which just went ITM. I fucking love this stock
Why not rolling stop loss?
pigs get fatter and fatter from all the juicy gains
Its ok, youll need to pay a premium to come buy back in on Monday but I dont blame you.

It matters lol
I'd recommend downloading Roller Coaster Tycoon before you hurt yourself
you pick your favorite number that expires next week and put down your life savings, pretty simple
Dont buy until u figure out LOL you playing a grown man game with calls boy
Kamikaze cash on YouTube. He'll teach you all you need
Honestly still a noob but the best way to learn is just doing it. Fuck it get one thats like 50c so like 50 bucks and see how the dynamics work
Go all in on close strike price for beginners with a week expiration date imo

End of day
socialist dipshit, george soros
People who buy it at $8 do that
I sold at 11$
more like being called a bagholder at 10.5$ lol
No get some quick
Nope
It's sure retarded not to be on board. Never too late if you hold PLTR TO THE EDGE OF THE GALAXY!
Never
Nope, the ship is refueling get in quick 
y u fence sit 4 a week
Thank you. I was just about to YOLO PLTR cause of FOMO.
Needed this thank you
Dont jump in on 30 calls?
hold
Diamond hands
I'm not your dad!
Hold king
i've got 12/18 35c i picked up this AM and i just sold half
if its good enough to screenshot its good enough to sell
You understand how trading works i assume. You dont buy from an endless pot
Huge sell walls just evaporate when the price gets near them.
Hey, Im in the same boat. Pigs get slaughtered. Very easily couldve gone the other way.
perfect time to buy the dip. this company will keep growing
Spoiler alert. There is no rug pull.
Buy some fucking ETFs or something like the boomer you are
Turkey and taters. Holy cow, thats a brilliant combo. Beer to go with this maybe?

We need a new Thanksgiving meal setup. Then on Monday Jim Cramer would lose his shit over this too.
A-fucking-men
bro were at mondays highs just calm down it cant keep going up
it dipped so the rest of the retards can get in on in and pump to the moon
I bought a hundred shares and a leap but I sold a call and now I don't know which one they're gonna sell.
hahahhahaha
You would be too if you've spent a good chunk of money on PLTR
hahahahhahahahah ik bro this gay asf but then call me a gaggot
Embrace it. As long as you do this you will have one of those every week
holy shit
With all the hype probably a safe bet
JMIA > PLTR
good enough to post good enough to sell
gains are gains
Did the same thing but x20 man
I've done this 3 times today. 3 FUCKING TIMES I should have held on longer. What a sight to behold. Tendies blowing in the wind.
Buy buy buy

this ship ain't dropping til it hits $50 by EOY
same. this is madness
59% ME for me right now. Leaves me bout 6k in excess. Maybe I should put another k down.
If you want to make a +25% omelet you have to break some -6% eggs
Tell me about it
Is that your favorite word?
Heading towards? We have been here for a while now.
Did u even read the fucking dd? He said it wont run for another 2/3 weeks
Where's that guy who said yolo in th c - b? 
are you threatening us?
never a doubt, my guy

Everyone who doubted PLTR - vaccines on me!  


they print money
Makes us money, brother. No more questions and start averaging down!
Something with plants probably. Doesn't really matter
Gubmint data or something idk
They provide a full stack solution for turning shitty company data from disparate systems into usable info - their government stuff is similar but more tied to intelligence based on individuals
Funny cause they know everything about you..
dip? where
Lol for real?
Dont let the door hit your gaping pussy on the way out
Pusssy your gains are gonna be super low compared to waiting next week
Discounted share alert!
Pussy
Sometimes its better this way
You will thank yourself as you admire your gains while chilling this thanksgiving weekend.
Every other day was +-5% with IV rn a slightly red day could blow up an account
Literally has been called out here for 2 weeks
Better sell at open
Dont spread your gayness. 0.14% red dont count
Oof
Ticker RTRD
Just imagine the volatility and the lineup
$MEME
I would by $ATST all day
SEC: "So tell us about your diversification strategy"

WSB: "Whats diversification? Our ETF is 80% PLTR"
Wouldn't carry out that plan 100%, leave some dry powder on the sidelines
Sort tickers by how frequently they were mentioned, choose the first 5, moon etf done.
Would be interesting to compare it against sp500
Preach!
Agree, but we arent here to see your shares
Usually. But what if it moons?
Yea I was wondering why comments were downvoted the instance it is posted
Yeh man me too be patient this run is too insane

I've been selling and copping more for the next couple weeks
hold till 30 for a chance to get a ps5
$50 EOY
Sold my 15 23c's that expire Friday and am holding 5x 12/11 29c's and 401 shares. We holding the line bro!
PLTR is more than a meme stock my dude it's genuinely going to pop off and stay up. 

There's soooo much potential, especially given the fact that Biden just added a former Palantir exec as the director of national intelligence....
do you really want it to?
Id recommend taking some time off. Either hold true to your thesis or maybe sell some Cc if you thought it was gonna pull back.
You been drinking the koolaid?
delusional
some good shit u knock today bro....wow
Yes
Sure why not.
Sell or hold?
Obvious pump n dump brah
That will be a sad day
They working on it for sure
might be a p\*ss and get out today with 2000% returns.... what are you thinking
Yes. Boomers will get involved. Green Monday too after a weekend hold.
32 eod Friday
No one has ever mentioned them here!
or selling puts..
Not really, at $28 I got a $27 call for $500, making for a $32 break-even all the way out on 12/18

honestly not that bad
The sky? They're growing to the moon.
Last chance to see PLTR under $30
SHOTGUN A DICK AT THIS POINT, WERE RICH BABY!
do you want to be rich?
Literally free money
  
They literally tracked down Bin Laden and theyre named after a fictional all seeing crystal ball owned by an evil Wizard. 

And Peter Thiel is ceo. 


big data government contracts the future is in data
You dont bet against the government.
deadass lol
Big Dick energy
Lets goooooooookk
Its happening boys 
Lmao I got 130 grand in PLTR calls and I know that shit is dipping today. Way too fast of an ascension
For real?
PLTR
The whole EV sector is crushed right now do PLTR
I dont think you needed to add that last part lol
Were just trying to trigger the algos
$23.77 now
You'll lose it all soon
That was me with GRWG before the election and riding it through for another week+
How do you get dressed in the morning?
its uncanny dude
Factor of 100 difference in market caps...
Mods bought one, and not the other

Don't watch it. Wait a week when the merger is officially announced. It will blow up
i bought myself a louis bag messenger w/ NIO profits. Love yourself first brother.

You gonna buy back in after though right?
Ban
RIP
Rotation into AMZN
This is recycle emoji retard
Why a bee? We dont want pollinators around our weed.
Don't look now - it'll bounce right back.  Springs gotta coil, right?  
What happened?
I liked when it was up 2% after hours but I dont like that its down 2% now.
pls stop
When will this one go up again? After ER in January?
I think we dump today
Good boi
Value investor here !
Lol good luck
Became irrelevant faster than Amanda Bynes
Dont even trip Lil bro
Apparently UBER will start paying stock since they have no more cash.
Get your oil changed and clean out your back seat
Just average down at open
Ive got the 12 pro max and the 5 g isnt all they made it hyped up to be, I get lag and issues with it sometimes, had it for a week
I think your problem is TDA, 11 pro max works great for me on other brokers

Is NIO's CEO Elon's cousin?
bro are you on drugs?

[deleted]
Yeah. A little late. Might want to try RadioShack. I heard it's booming
Im people
"Yes"
Ask Again Later
Signs point to yes
> was $5 tomorrow 

Are you from the future?
I have some $30c for 05/21 and  01/2022. I just keep adding to it if there are any sizeable dips. Trim some off when I want to use gains for other things.
Average up
IKR
Yes
not about NIO
People are switching from NIO to PLTR.  
Take profits on NIO/sell/don't buy.
Nope, theyre not. A few articles just lead w/ those for clickbait and the following statements listed the TWO companies under investigation. Its good for NIO because that means theyre on their Ps and Qs to not be one of the investigated.
Same question. Anyone?
God speed. I dont think well see EV dip
What dip
That shit was moving down with SPY yesterday. And vice versa. Cant even use it as a hedge anymore. Shit is retarded.
Im all in 
at open, 600C 11/27 looks cute here
Wait till Friday EOD..its not gonna keep running imo
I just want it to stay below $50 for 3 more minutes
How is it there rn for tourists? Political stuff making anything weird?
You gonna hold or sell
Kick this kid outta the club, stat
Like you lost it?
Or sell now and rebuy lower retard

Id cash in
I cashed out this morning I made enough Im satisfied
sell a little to lock in gains and let the rest run its course.
I had 5k in amazon too and just sold out for 12k. Youre probably making a killing

after a 100% move? Guh. Where were you on IPO day
Me too bitch lets goo
5th day in a row of making the same mistake, RIP autist
Good thing it's not, as long as you buy shares and not calls
story of my life with tesla
Like rn, true bulls should be seeing this as a sale and like you said, knowing when to start looking the other direction. Tired of these frothing at the mouth 3 month old traders
Who said I didnt buy calls today?
Take at least some profits off the table
what are your expiration dates?
I was waiting for a dip and said fuck it, to the moon itll go 
Today's high will be another low at some point. So it's never too late.
You are safe.
Same I bought like 38 shares at 25.71 I'm going to hold for a while tho. the new national security director just quit pltr for her new white house job. she gonna throw so many contracts at those fuckers.
Markets shedding before the giving
Pissing me off
Making me cry
Loading up baby

Date/strike?
With what expiry date?
Probably because we have to draw the line at some pump and dumps, otherwise this board will be just another stocktwits.
because people got excited, and it went down for 1 day, so a bunch of literal babies cried fowl that they lost max 10%  
  
mod probably left his butt plug in too long.
Pump crew was all over the board yesterday.
Banned small caps.  So essentially all SPACs
Mods gay
Because it is a pump and dump - now get banned
Get in sugar Ill sell you the calls ;)
Positions?
Its classy af
Why. They do a sale or something?
Same. They have the best clothes imo. Nordstrom rack had some amazing deals when I went there a couple weeks ago
And into PLTR choooo choooo get on the train
Fisker is way up, its just profit taking and rotation.
I bought the dip
Idk man, im just sad now :(
buy at market?
no
Yes. It closes early at 1pm on Friday
Yes, but closes early on Friday
Ya half day Friday tho
yup. Friday's a short day though, close at 1pm.
closes at 1 on friday
Yup limited hours tho
IM READY
We already did
I want to pull the trigger on some calls, but they pricey.
ok, wp
Sure hope so. Sold my AMZN calls right before that big green candle like a jackass to buy TSLA calls
TLT
BND
I only know of ANGL. Would love to hear some others
GME
yes yes retards comparing completely different companies.

Makes total sense. 

GTFO
Youll be back.
I said that on Monday after taking some PLTR profit. I was back 27 minutes later.
See you Friday when market re-opens.
Ayyyyyee profits, better than what a lot of people can say
I was getting worried waiting for you to let us know if you were done trading or not, thanks for the update bro 
The market is open early friday
I would guess at EOD today we see a drop and another on Friday
Yeah probably test 24... volume always super low throughout the day, typical spike then slow bleed then some movement AH
Were gonna settle around $25 and then another jump to $27 early AM on Friday and from there I have no clue.
Tapering off because it's Holidays tomorrow and short market on Friday.
Hopefully it goes to 27
It seems I was wrong...
Volume is not tapering off. 61 million at 11:00 
Avg is 86 daily
Keep doing that. Way better than losing everything!
Buying the nio dip
I was watching the crsr dip, my account is banned from buying
Profit is profit... but yeah. If I had not sold half the shit I bought friday last week, I'd be up like 200% instead of only 60% that I'm at now.
400 people die each day in NYC just due to normal deaths

If they lock the country down like retards, yes we will crash again but not nearly as hard as last March.
Take a wild guess
I am baby
Definitely
Sell and push it more OTM. Maximize gains
Sell one. Ride the rest to Valhalla
lock in some of the gains. let the rest ride. or rollout the rest. Id sell 3 of them and rollout two
No harm in selling & rebuying further out if you think itll continue to run. 12/24 30cs would be the way Id go.
its called IV not nothing
Sell half ride the half
Don't get greedy. Sell.
I bought
Yes, its going to $100 within 2 months, get in while its under $50 and ride with us to Saturn then Andromeda Galaxy bro.
yes aka yes
Yee
PLTR 27 in 30 minutes...
wanted to load on 25c that expire on Friday but I'm PDT restricted....
Get fuked
Last chance for anyone dumb enough to not be aboard yet
Did that yesterday and regretting it a little bit, not a ton because I only sold off half but definitely regretting it a little bit
Boomers get rekt
This is wonderful news. Ask your bro what theyre all piling into every day so we can go along for the pumps and dumps.
Damn, I knew Slack was a buyout play but not that fast.
??
 
To the next galaxy... far far away
       
Roll out and up your PLTR options to a further expiry. Idk about OSTK
No its gonna fly on Friday
If you've never made any profit, take some. It helps mentally to take some profit. Don't exit the whole position if you don't want to - but take SOMETHING.
exactly. u need money to make money
Eat shit Bill
Petition to suck my ass
Not growing fast enough keep buying this shit
Consistent and gradual 
This one here mods.
You will be rewarded next week
What date
Soon you'll have to remove that flair 
I did so u shouldnt
get em now before the premium goes up
It will top out and bagholders will be left holding...by that time WSB will be off to next meme like a.crack whore with amnesia.
I keep waiting for that rude awakening and keep watching all the tards here make tens of thousands, while I scrap profits in 100s
At this point its free money. Unless you think theyre going to go out of business, which isnt likely. If you only have one call, and not a pile of them, you may want to hold it forever, and forget about it - as exercising that call for 100 shares in 2022, if the stock splits and compounds could actually be a great thing for you.
diamond hands retard
?
I bought at 14.64 and I am still not +100%
Lol
GREEEEEEEEN.
Yellow looks best for the hurican, orange for aventador. If you have kids a blue Urus
Higher
It can potentially compete with Salesforce.
Itll be a trillion dollar company my guy.
A luxury electric car company in a big ass country thats yet to turn an operating profit and is facing competition from countless other companies is at like $600bn right now
Have you heard about mrinvestorpro?
Turnt already*
I sold mine at 600% lol
Sell when it hits 30. I'm anticipating a sell wall there.
Wtf
Me too :)
profit is profit.
I know the feeling.
Tendies are tendies no matter how salty.
Most people sell at 100% loss, so I'd say you're doing pretty well
Puts on my balls dropping
Bruh, DD. As soon as they confirm a merger, tendie town awaits
Yes
im holding 100 shares
Ticker is under 1B so it's autobanned from WSB until then. Enjoy accumulating til then.
Amen to that.
Nah... I'm doing effing backflips down the hallway. My co-workers... all know what that means.
it's called Google buddy.
Some stocks just dont look back
because its gotten multiple government contracts, plus they spy on all of your fetishes so you better hope it doesnt plummet or your history is gonna get leaked
Government agency backed big data. Recent ipo. Undervalued. SNOW ipo'd and hit near 300 first day of trading and they are commercial data. Extreme potential but a lot of people dont understand data companies unless someone spoonfeeds them
There are still terrorists around the world breathing. Palantir will find them.
Retard Strength
rockets only go one way and that's up! $30 EOD
Ask that same question to PTON or SQ when they were taking off
Because you ask retarded questions
RSI dropped a bit, room to run up more.
Errr...no... just no
I had calls for $485 expiring friday that I sold for 200% profit, If i'd held them I'd be driving a lambo next week. I've got 200 TSLA shares though, so I'm still making a nice profit this week.
Nice
Thank you for your service
I hope that guy is getting hazed so hard
For real
wsb tricked the algos into buying
boar gang checking in
Its not a scheme when the government does it
I should probably buy my girlfriend something nice
Uh oh
With you, bears for the come back
Hurry we just all go start shilling PLTR on tiktok, Facebook, and Instagram. Keep the money flowing in!
Lol why? It usually ends well
When it goes down its going down big. Buy puts and use that money to buy that fucking dip baller
I'll help cream in yours too
Same bro
Some sad salty  yeah lol
Im getting giggle fits every time I check back.
35
Just before dec 31st
imnotselling.gif
Sell? what is that
Yikes
What does this mean??
How do you calculate max profit on that?? Im thinking of doing the same thing
Im with you, just bought so puts expiring Friday, everything that goes up must come down . Right?
If you bought at the peak and gonna day trade, might make some money, but I wouldn't bet against retard strength. Most of the people with loss porn down -99% are perma bears that fought strong stocks or bought crazy OTM FDs. Don't  be one of those, but get profits where you can brother 
Never, king
Are you retarded?
No
Get in loser we're going to mars
of course not
Get in
I said that this morning...and then bough 11/27 $34 a few hours ago
Yea what the fuck lmao
No no no!! Stonks only go up get out of here with that negative attitude!!!!
June and August were overextended. Were not even close to those levels yet. We could blow past 3700 and not be there yet
The end of the bottom chart of this actually makes me think were probably not there yet https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/
Can't we just slap clean energy stickers on the same gas powered cars and call it a day?
H o w
ehh.
You were saying this when it was $15 a share. Anyone that listened to you hates you.
Congratulations, theyve catalogued your criticism.
What? You didnt see how bullish this pandemic was?
Yet.

Fake news, fake link, this guy wants your PLTR shares
spy 364c at open, sell at 955am.
Which way SPY trending today?
While i would make good $ off AMZN +100... I'd be mad salty NGL. I went from 3 naked 11/27 3100c into 35x 3100/3105c debit spreads.
Yes, you silly
Yes. But Friday the market closes 3 hours earlier
hoes are the worst - stay away from them and just make money
Thats like selling Tesla at the bottom in March. Lol.
Yes
key indicator: mass downvoting
so sorry man i was almost u 5 minutes ago
No it might touch 60 around Christmas coming up. I'm not selling fuck you pussies
IKR
That was 7 months ago?
Sold mine at open 
25 dollahz
25-25.50
Im thinking 26.5
might touch 26 again. not sure though since most stuff is down.
Crsr is going to touch 60 by eoy
Never went away.
lmao its gonna crash like crsr and we can buy again
CMPS. Thank me later.
What strike? Ill buy em from you
just buy contracts if your that confident, you need atleast $100 though
Buy in now fuckboy the next dip is at 28
 takeoff
Welcome to the team, brother
Have my upvote.  Bears have no power here.
strap in pussy we're headed to 30
Sarcastic? Or else thats the dumbest thing I ever heard
That is a dumb question. If stonk goes up - call worth more. If stonk goes down, call worth less. A PLTR call will not be hard to sell if it doesn't crash. 

If you exercise the option, you have a peanut for a brain - don't do that. The price of that option represents the difference in price between your strike and the current + premium to account for the chance that it might continue to go up. So you'd basically be saying "I don't care about the premium, I'll buy the stonk please" - but exercising your call would discard that premium you paid (or now own, due to IV likely going up), so that you could buy the shares... But assuming you have the money to buy the shares... why not just buy them. Or hold til expiry. If you're poor then sure, sell the call, buy the shares. Hopefully this has been informative.
You keep the premium and all of the $$ above the call price.
you would make more money selling the option than excerising in most cases i believe
You would exercise in that case and make bank
I bought it at 14% today and it was difficult lol
Then buy now before 60
Nah that aint it lol
10am pt
Ban
Of course it is when I sold sell my 17.5c 12/18 calls at a loss last week.
My salary
Start with a small amount and focus on percentage gains. Grow your confidence and learn that ups and downs are normal. Then youll be ready to strike when youve got some cash down the line. Good luck.
Fuck man Im in the same boat. Im just gonna hold
Covid?
My dealer
ZM trading below 500
too depressed to hang around here
GPS Puts. Ask yourself are they better now than they were pre Covid?
Buy the dip
SHOP was my first really big score. It will always hold a special place in my heart.
Such a good song lmao
Thats one of those stocks that I like but I just cant seem to play correctly. AMD was good to me when I was learning options, but every time Ive touched NVDA its ended in tears. Tears as in rips in my butthole
EV gang is fucked though
Buy PLTR
What he said  
Can you share any reading on this,?
Or explain simply for a retard?
It's going to drop hard. Don't buy the dip
 I shorted it yesterday but was too much of a pussy to continue.. covered in the mid 24 range.. this will likely dump for a while. Merger is far away.
stonks only go up
CRWD. Going to 160 before earnings 12/02

Just write calls instead? Make money from selling weeklies

Its funky for me .
The word "squashy" makes me feel weird in a good way.

Don't tell them. MGNI 30c 2022.

The king is alive and well tho
Dude its been running for like 2 weeks. Why in the hell would you jump in now?
Dont fomo buy after a crazy runup...
<subscribed>
Where? My entire watchlist is green hulk

Yea turns out 11/27 600 might not have been the right play
Get in on the BABA dip
Bagger? I barley know her
XPEV 12/4 45p
Just let us know about it
Not if the SEC doesnt know about it
Nah
Yup
its only insider trading if you don't tell everyone here what he said...
Only if u keep dry snitching on urself and get caught... Lolz JK
Let us know in the DMs
Just a baby pullback, dont worry hunny
Thank God, time to short the fuck out of it until a good re-entry level.

It had a great run, now back to reality
We arent doing well man
Almost crying  -8 pre mrkt
Calls on LL because people will need to rebuild their homes

Why? Any reason or just some profit taking?
Join the club. If u have stupid ass ceo s who claim 60% efficacy while others are claiming 96% then yeah we are all fucked
What he say now?
yea, at the baby gap
Tsla owners
They have nice sweaters sometimes so yes and its always busy at the outlet mall.
You mum did
Same except Im bummed about my BABA 12/18 270s
It's gotta bounce back, right?
I tHoUgHt StOnKs oNlY gO uP??
The fuck is an nyc suburb? Staten fucking island?
That fuckin sucks. I just got back from the gym and I'd be pissed if they closed it back down.
congrats
Not everyone Larry, not everyone my guy
Theyre retarded.  

Wait before making any moves.
Only if they bought yesterday tbh. Still up decently from Monday and last week.
That's because its not Chinese.
But not enough. Why'd I pick the only one not to moon.
China investigating it's EV stocks. Pulling a citron on itself.
China investigating two EV companies.
Sell off. Which isnt to bad in the long run. Guess 10% everyday is not sustainable somhow???
Short term pull back.  Reload like crazy at opening.
Can you expand on that a little?
Done
It might go all the way up to $21.28!!
Try r/illegallifeprotips
778k
Just rub some xpeng on it and wait a couple of weeks
Use Vicks Vaporub
Funko pop is green. Memes ride again
Exactly hur dur
Yes, most of the sweet premium has been squeezed out already. Short of massive moves, it's not worth the risk.
Thetagang bro.

[As of 30 seconds ago](https://i.imgur.com/abe8vD2.jpg)
Still pretty thin on both sides
Someone posted a big wall at 22 IIRC like 30 minutes ago
best place to find this?
Market loves that.
Thanks Biden
bullish
Hold both, really good prospects for both.
Yeah if you aren't already loaded up, go for atleast Jan or Feb though for safety.
Always. They roll him out on down days. Market 50% undervalued!
.5% ?
you don't belong here if you think thats bigly
*pltr
lol
Instagram influencers
Not smart enough to trade options
Super volatile.
Because theyre retarded. And not in the good way.
To mitigate fx risk
Nah not yet let pump till before Christmas
Well tomorrow is closed and Friday they close early so
Well market closed tomorrow and Friday ( half)
This the UFO guy?
INTO PIECES, THIS IS MY LAST RESORT
many tiny profits and minimal L's = bigly profits 

let some ride next time tho
Yeah ive been doing that too. Its good to practice the discipline and consistency but holy shit is it sad seeing how much you coulda made if you held. Took me 2 weeks to make something i coulda made in one day of iron handing
Yeah my NIO leaps would have changed my life. I was hovering over the Buy button for $25c when it was fucking $22 !! then my PLTR $10c 11/20 got sold on 11/3 because of the election uncertainty, which would have went 1500% and the $11c was easily 2000% (back when pltr was $9.30)

Unreal man. At least youre on the right track, you have the brains...you just need a little more luck on your side
That lucky fuck who bought my MP 1/15 $15 calls/day trades. If I had held on for simply ten more minutes I would have made my quad witching hour losses back finally.

DD was gold. Back to Chinese EV SPACs.
When not red
Ppl were getting a little too excited i said $520 maybe even $550

I'd hold. It's not really a meme stock. Just a good company going through a patch.
What's the play?
Hold for eternity
Calls?
Retardation builds riches
solid and good momentum
BLNK is such a piece of shit so many retards on twitter think its the future.
Agree. Every time I hear about a recall from Ford, GM, Chrysler, etc its well over 100,000 vehicles.
Thicc b and pltr
Baba
NIO
Long term NIO, XPEV stole from TSLA so they might get fucked sometimes in future.
So youre saying were going up?
Polls are fake, rural white men don't answer truthfully
why are you trusting any polls saying the race is tied when every pollester except for tralfgar missed the gop vote by anywhere from 3-6%. Also the dem who's in the run off with Kelly is a nut so much os osoff is even telling him to go the fuck away.
What do you mean?
Down probably
he's like the ultimate autist
That was really good, thx
I fomod before close so who knows!
FOMO into pltr and thicc b
Stfu
Ok Im an English lit major (self-taught because I read) and wtf is portmanteau ? The rest I get.
Just ass cheeks volume on options
The IV is so ridiculously high its barely worth the risk. Better off just buying shares
I see Mark Cuban and I'm in
Was thinking about this too -- shares or calls -- the options calculator doesn't look *that* great given the premiums.
Lmao enjoy sitting on the street ma dude
Yes! Citi raised to BUY price target $26

FSR gonna MOOOOON!
Yes! Citi raised to BUY price target $26

FSR gonna MOOOOON!
it aint bro we down 1% after a 9% rally the past week, just taking a breather before liftoff, also the entire market is down
it's been hopping back and forth in the same range for hours. Doesn't really matter at this point till open. Even then the first 15 minutes means shit.
Alibaba didnt do to good in China, BABA probably gonna mirror
Ahh yes. Buy puts when it's down 15% in premarket.
This is the way
What strike? Its already dropped alot.
India thing seems like much ado about nothing
AMD on a steady climb to 100
I dont give a fuck about no one except meeeee

What did you do
i tried but missed it, enjoy the moon
you mean +6%

Oh yes. Massive massive potential. Price point just increased to 21$ due to their non opioid pain management for cancer. 

DD: covid plays could be insane mostly for rapid at home testing (covistix) and their therapuetic drug has proven to be extremely potent at low doses in trials , cancer pain management blocks out pain receptors using capsaicin and is a game changer
Lmao stop loss hit yesterday trying to preserve gains. Oof
Got a great scalp out of that
Everyone is already in BABA...
shhh, as long as ant ipo news doesnt cuck things. Ill be taking profits more frequently because of that
Everyone already has baba, if you say anything positive about it guaranteed 5 upvotes
Uneducated guess 280-285.
285 would be ideal. But probably 280-285
that is not a good reason to not invest

I'd recommend closing and waiting for re-entry at a more reasonable price little further out.  I feel like there will be a small pullback in the near term.  I plan on closing out my Jan and looking 3-4 months out in the $15-20 range.
next time buy PLTR
If you didnt buy PLTR you must hate money
What'd you buy?
It's a good long term play. And at the very least, I don't think its done mooning in the short term.
Looks promising...
Give me an expiration for SBE
The only thing im getting into is your mom
play monthlies
The fire rises brother. Soon we will squeeze the shorts with no survivors

Patience young Liam. It will go up as the holiday season hits full stride
volume isn't even that bad and is actually above average for holiday week
He fomo
MSOS has options now. :)
Sell off has a few days  to run. Power hour is going to be shower hour
not even back to VWAP.  this thing is going to explode higher today on low volume retardation
I can see LULU making a run to ATH
QRTEA is more valuable than LULU and trades at 10. LULU is a trend. It will eventually go to shit. QRTEA is a monster
How high do you think they'll go?
Depends on when earnings are I try and plan leaps after earnings so I can get the run up. At 200% I sell some of them and roll them over into stocks and future calls.

I didn't even know they were public, my previous employer used them as a vendor. 1400 p/e is wild though
It's going to 80.
Rather get into pltr
bubble popped yes.  it will run back over time but not for a while.  unpopular opinion but this shit was overbought and we all knew it
PLTR 100c
Same bro, i think we will be good
That's a big 10-4 floppy, go for launch 
T-Mobile pretty solid
Sprint
My set up is stirrups and a bottle of KY as AT&T comes to collect each month.
Shares?
50c?
Why would buying more make u a day trader?
wait
Cash account?
Got out of my 11/27 30c today with 240% gain. Sold at the top of $26.15
That's not how it works. You can sell then buy same day but not buy then sell.
Its shit
Its literally rebounding rn
what is that?
Dont
Shares
TSLA
solid company
IPOd valuation was fucked up, fair value should be about 5-5.5bn mcap
Search it in wsb. There was a dd a month or 2 ago that made a bunch of ppl richer here
bless you retard
You already pocketed the $30 when you sold it
that $30 credit is all you get, thanks for playing
Ok you are confused so lemme explain. When you sold at .30 you should have collected 30$ in premium. Now that its at 3.50. When that expires you will owe 350$ minus 30$ that you got in premium so 320$ net loss
$30. 

If there is no risk of being called out and selling your shares you can let it go to expiration.  You can also buy that call back for $350 and sell one farther out to get some of that back if you don't want to sell your shares yet.  Selling calls is a hedge.  You technically are losing money on the call as you are gaining money on the stock gains.  If the price doesn't hit the strike that call goes to zero and you made the original $30 anyway.  But as it stands now the call option (hedge) position is down $320 while your stock, I am sure, is much more up.  Covered calls is not a good strategy when there is large increases in stock prices.  It is a great strategy for near sideways movement (barely green or red).
No offense but you shouldn't be selling covered calls if you don't know what you're doing
u already made ur money when u sold it for .30
You're only going to get what you sold it for so if it was $.30 you only get to keep the $30 if you let it expire. Unless the volume is super low on that bid/ask you might have to sell whatever you sold the covered call against though. What are you selling covered calls on and what's the long position you're holding
You lost out on 320$ in gains bud
Pltr is saving me but I still want spy to go green by noon
Be happy, but be worried for the next 15-30 still. Prolly going to be another sell off today or tomorrow and then a massive sustained rise
And they haven't even done the test flight yet.  coming
Me too, JMIA to TSLA was a good trade
It will continue to correct over the month. I sold my calls yesterday. Over 50 is way too overvalued. It is fair valued in the lower 30s and higher 30s for growth.
Never?
Ive been trying to fix my paper hands too. Its hard. Lower amounts of money and longer expiration usually do it.
it will fall, like all the others before it. the stonk rises, brother.
"rip" usually means up bro


You're using that wrong
Infinite loop gains
Wdym
lol youll be ITM on Friday, im in on same but 55c, already up 15% on that dip
At the opening price I have stop loss
Whats the play
positions?
Mmmm have you looked at ES? Its red.
buy two PS3s and stick them together
It's like a boomeme stock.
Cramer Wazzzzuppppppp!!!!!
You look like my testicle-filled left ballsack, Cramer!
Rumor is that they received the loan this morning
Dade County Corrections still?
no dude
Bullish sentiment is nuts right now
Sounds like youre not in PLTR
I did.
Captain Hindsight much?
Bought some shares
My watch list says we going back to tech. Yes
Whats ur favorite song of his?
They just give their opinion unfortunately people listen
In what way do they manipulate stock price
Are you blind?
Its going to pump eod prolly
Use Robinhood, pleb
Merrill did that yesterday too.
TD is the best out there
Especially with their strong balance sheet and track record of never diluting shares.
PowerPoint? Same bro
It wont be the top soon brother
It's a flash sale before resuming it's trajectory to the moon.
Needs more memes
It's either Timex or Rolex here, guy.
I decided not to get one because the Apple Watch is infinitely better for a small multiple of the price. Plus theres a subscription price for halo
Buy dip
It's going to cool off for a while but it is still a great long hold
Buy the dip dont sleep
I think itll run up next two weeks
FAMG
PLTR, duh
MGNI
cuz nio fucked us and pltr is buying our family and friends christmas presents
[deleted]
fuckin commie
Yeah. They probally want to keep it sub 12.50 before earnings. That's fine with me. I'll jump in a few fd's for earnings. The cheaper gme is on earnings the better the pop is. Weeklies are not the answer until the day of December 8th.
Im skeeting everywhere
Upgraded $26 PT.
New EV rotation facts 
My dick is yuge
Yes baybehhh
Probably up in sympathy with IPOB and some dipshit on fast money calling it a buy. Or IPOB up in sympathy with SPCE who really knows.
SPCE was so last year bruh. Pltr is the new spce
Glad Im not the only one waiting for that. 22.5 would be nicer though
Yes. Moon dildos coming. 16 inches
We red but my account is green dildo.
It dips like 1230-3. Bottom is 3 after 
I would appreciate it if we just went straight to $35 instead of jumping around at this level.
thats my cue, going bear
Nope. Doing just fine. Thanks though!
The last stage...
plz
Theres no way SPY stays sideways like this
My recent favourite, 'WTF BABA'  
The tone is everything

Crsr maybe
U had your chance yesterday and this morning
I did. You just need to listen to the right comments.
I actually did a couple weeks ago. Something along the lines of "If your not in JMIA, you need to be NOW". At the time it was $15 a share.
Dude it keeps getting rejected Im scared its gonna dive before long
JPM

Well you cant predict the future. Sold Xpev at 44 literally at the start of the run up. Lol
600!
We're a couple security contracts away from Deus Ex
Not in Europe
I was sad for 8 seconds too this morning. Now imma take adderall and check my RH account every 3 mins till 4
I was staring at it but saw all the green EV dildos

Played myself today. Should have figured there would be a holiday selloff
Cant stop wont stop
I would secure profits before new year and roll over higher strike
I was watching the recovery go up and up and too pussy to buy
Lmao wtf.
yooooo, you never go full autist
There is so much free money to be made in this market and retards like you make plays like that
No balls.
gah! I am just annoyed I sold all my $600s due to short trading week.
Not the rest of your life. Just the rest of your option life.
Dayumn. Probably a good move for Slack.
Man so close to being able to sell CCs lol
50-58$ ig
40?
$40
When its at 300 are you going to care whether you bought in at 18,29,25 or 39?
Dont be thinking the same thing when it hits 30
think halted for volatility? CRM wants to buy...?
WORK is halted -- CRM in talks to buy them. No Trading
We are good the tendy train just turned around temporarily to let some more buyers on.
So fun
That would be the worst move you could make
APHA above 7? time for puts

stonks only go up
Stfu  shits going to 30 EOD
LOL
Rather go DPW. Cheaper and way more room to pop
Sell at 30   
Hold that shit till monday. Set a stop loss if you scared
Im trying to do the same. Timing this is hard.
it will hit 30 before any dip.
There was plenty last week even.  Usually means shit about to hit fan.  Hope not.
The 13% to 11% gain dip of PLTR.
PLTR. Maybe.
I caught CRSR's dip
Every PLTR dip for 2 weeks now has literally been free money
Halted
halt dumdum
Literally 15,000%
HOLD bro
Hold maybe through Black Friday cyber Monday
I just took a massive L smh
long hold probably, its just starting its holiday run
What isnt
Cause $WORK is a loser stock lmao
F
Only if you do your part
Pump and dump due to Tillman call
CRM buyout.
Crm buyout possible at $17B
Sales force buyout
why?
25,000% increase so far
Told myself I would sell once it hit 14.50. Fuck these diamond hands
Go go go!

Patience my friend
why? i was about to switch to IBKR
What?! $32 is a bit weak....
FUCK
Honestly who cares? Unless you had tons its not like that would be worth that much.
Dude I sold 12 32c 11/27s at 11am this morning for $24, -98% loss. Worth 8.8k at the top...
hahahahah baggg holdderrrrr

Feels good to be back above 50

almost any PLTR call
PLTR. But hurry on
You really gotta ask my man come on

Pls

PLTR calls
Pltr
Thic bee
Pltr
PLTR obviously
Dumped for a loss. I wanted out bad
Buying company always goes down on acquisition news because theyll essentially be forced to overvalue the target
I dont know but I grabbed a quick call because that drop made no sense to me
Theyre buying slack
If PLTR? NAH
Thats definitely crossing over into slight yolo territory
This is the way
$20 1/15
$30 2/19
15P
PLTR, aint gonna be late when its $60 EOY
not a financial advise. but may be the evs that have taken a dip today.
Mark russel wasnt to reassuring about what Trevor Milton might do with all his shares.  He is able to dump all his shares as he did not want to join the rest of the companies to extend the lockup period. I think that should tell you everything about that company
Theta gang means selling covered calls?
Hop in its still going
I'm so sad I was gunna buy December 4 $15 calls when it was 13 and didn't pull the trigger
I hope so. But fucking wall street analyst gave this stock a buy rating and Nikola tried to pamper the lock up period by saying all the other investors are agreeing to a delayed lockup till May 2021.
which contract should i get? 15p?
I would wait until the lockup if you are buying long term (stocks). There are better stocks if you are buying stock for long term that can get better gains now.
I got in at 15 but only with a little bit of money, Ive been waiting each day for this bitch to fall to buy more, it just hasnt happened yet I might say fuck it
This could be the dip but Im waiting till EOD to pick up another call
It's gonna be like $SEA but in Africa. The fact that money's been constantly buying in means that it's not a mere speculation or MMs trying to screw us up
Is JMIA the real deal??
Sold the day before
I did and Robinhood glitched telling me it was worthless. So I sold at a loss
salesforce will buy.. thank god I held on that one!!! :D
Bro everyone is gonna be talking about this shit with their families over turkey, gonna give em the FOMO and COVID at the same time
Gotta get in before special dividend, then gonna dump it
please buy puts for the homies then
Flowing into FSR
Anyone who holds blnk should dump it for SBE!
I should have fucking bought more yesterday!!!!!  when it took a little breather and dropped a bit.  so stupid so stupid.  Shit is going to the 40s.
>J M I A

up 22% today. still room? what the fuck
On a buyout that could be over 50? Ya no
Or set your money on fire, your choice
Nope holding, hope you bought da dips
I'm holding. This could go to 60 if real. Sell your initial investment if scared.
Just hold. The Salesforce ecosystem is fucking huge that Slack will tap into.
12/4 puts at todays high. Closing out eod
seems like a pretty tight coil
yeah it's gonna dip all the way to $30
Agreed.  Will be a run up to Nov deliveries release.  Maybe a pop afterwards if they really surprise.
But deep inside, theyre a lazy boomer company plagued by unions and an inherent distaste for electric cars 

I hope they go bankrupt and finally disappear. I hope Tesla finally kills them off.
small cap stock, ban
PayPal offering free trading for the fake currencies until jan 1, I'll be doing that and betting on sports
RIP Juice Wrld
it literally just bottomed yesterday
It's insane.  I can only hope this is a GME preview.
Every time I think they're ready to go bankrupt, they beat earnings and rip
For what it is, $750b market cap seems hilariously low
$25 1/15 here
Utilizing my first amendment right and super-spreading duh
In Elon we trust
345
Great for slack but sales force has to spend money
it looks like the sentiment is that WORK doesn't actually make money.. so for them, getting bought out is great, and CRM just bought a company that doesn't make money.. so.. bad deal.
Google is your friend
Are u up or down
I didn't sell when it spiked to $14+ on Monday. Regrets ! :D
please!
On what
Not a lot of money needs to be moved for us to get close to 600 
JMIA PLRR FUBO
I was yesterday, F
What's Bezos got to do with MSFT
I made some money opening and closing these. Now Im bag holding
Fuck it Im in
godly
Got some dip
IV is insaneeeeeeee
Buy stocks then
Probably could buy on Friday at a lower premium.
Nope Pfizer
Yes hold man that's so far out
go jerk one off everytime you wanna sell, it makes you think logically     
572 eod
You are the disgrace of  WSB family  
:/
Stupid question but who is the rumored target?
Huh?
shes going to the moon, the PLTR train dont dip far for no man
Yes get it at market open on friday
expecting it to reach back to 112 or so with all of these new cases and lockdowns
Until $69
until Jan for tax reasons, uncle sam is diamond handing me
Lose enough money -> lose all your emotions
>What % of you portfolio is PLTR right now? Consensus? I have 20% and itching for more

100%
200
Will be 99.9% after it runs.
50%
25% NIO, 25% PLTR
1/5th
25% not enough?
It has become 60%, which makes me nervous quite frankly but when I bought I said I was not selling in 2020
Depending on the expiration... if the strike is to far out you well loose big time...unless you wanna gamble it and expect the stock to move to that strike. Its better closer In The Money
Otm is more price movement, more gain more risk.
Make more on a successful high strike. Easier and more modest gains on a closer strike
If the stock moves up the otm strikes will increase in value more, however theres obviously the increased risk of them being otm at expiry
I had some CRM calls for earnings! I am an idiot!
Lol did you just exit your time machine from last spring
Better late than never
Woot woot
Sell and buy PLTR

Youll make up the loss by Friday
Im debating on getting back in, maybe January calls tho
where u think its going? lowkey nuuve is a great concept, dont see how they beat thic boi tho long term. I moved all nbac gains to thc boy, hcac and gik
How yall finding these new tickers before these massive gains?
Fed increasing rates to eat the cash they pumped in to avoid an inflationary depression.
BABA is a great stock for some diversity.  Slow grower.  I've got $30k in LEAPS.  Unpredictable when it will make it's jumps.  I like FSLY too but when?
Ban
So buy puts then?
Thought it expired dec 4
With that IV probably not
I would have if I didnt sell yesterday at EOD like a poosy
Got a price target?

pissed I missed this one.
Definitely
Worth a shot
PayPal has no fee trading on it until Jan 1, if you already have a PayPal account
NBAC legit?
Yeah. It's almost at 28 right now
Have you seen what this thing is doing?
I would think so. Even though i would wait to buy at EOD as it has this daily ritual of flashing towrds close
Lol yes
This is the way.
Hold retard, hold like your balls depend on it.
Youre out of your mind. This is one stock Id just keep holding
nvm....
Was like 30k between 28 and 28.10
Its yuuuge
Tiny
tiny
Broken
It'll be up 10%+ tomorrow.
I just hope it doesn't become a meme stock. This is one of my long term holds
Ive got Dec 4th as well, really considering holding a few more days
Y
seriously....sold my 29c FD at 50% and it doubled since..come on.. be respectable PLTR.
Why will it crash when we are not selling? Taking profits? We don't do that here
Same here. I did it with Tesla too. Thing is I always believed in Peter thiel but the fact it became a meme stock made me not buy it
30.
Looking like $29
I was good with $25 but market is like, lets get $80 champ
30
lol nobody knows, it's already soared way beyond fair value and that was a while ago. Now this is no man's territory
SLV used to be a WSB meme, but it hasnt gone anywhere since August.
PLTR
Airlines 
It doesnt get much play in here, but I think PLTR will eventually pay out if youre willing to wait at least 10 minutes.
P
Realistically $50-$60 range
55$ quote me on that.
Rip.
BUT IS THIS A DIP OR AM I FUCKED FOREVER NOW

\^\^\^THIS IS THE REAL QUESTION
Debating on dropping 15k in this dip
sold 50 of them for 10 cents yesterday no worries held my 25s and sold those today
hold
I would sell at 600% profit but im a pussy
its just taking a breather, stop bullying it
yes
I'm holding so yes
i see it going to $40 by next month. Seems like a target for all these meme stocks.
100 2021
$30 EOD
It means buy it now, and in February buy more
Means investors that owned shares before going public cannot sell their shares until lock out period ends

Which ends early Jan 21 from what I read
time before insiders can start freely dumping shares
Just bought 11/27 @ 20.5
Yes
$60
wut? your down??! wtf
Because PLTR is mooning 
The question is do I exercise my palantir calls or ride to the moon...
5/21/21 $22 call
are you retarded
IPO was two months ago my autistic brother.
Extremely but Ill do it w you
Yes so do it
Same it just reversed all my losses for today
I think theres still some stupid shit left
gonna have to be like a straight line to 25

 pltr taking the sting out of it . it was ugly at first
Fully loaded into this one. This will be the only one out of the SPAC frenzy I'm going to hold post-merger.
When tho?

JKS, it's been flat for a couple weeks now
Ok daddy
I got my entire portfolio on pltr right now. Im not sucking my bosss dick my entire life.
AMEN
Pltr
Its the hidden gem people are slowly realizing. If you dont buy you hate money
Me too
I literally dumped it 3 days ago and bought PLTR. No regrets. RKT is a shitty stock
I love RKT and its a long hold for me

Monday here Im gonna ball sack deep in PLTR leaps Ive had enough
I heard there's only a few shares of PLTR left and they'll be all gone...
Can you wait until pltr trades sideways for a bit and buy another put for all of us? Alot of people in here would be very happy if you did!
Put that PLTR away and never touch it again
I've been in and out of codx.  It's small cap so it runs super hard.
roll it out for more money
If you bought today, then yes ur retarded. If u bought anytime previously, stfu and take ur gains fucker
Webull
Look at hedge fund manager over here
Completely dead. Market gives zero fucks tho
The morning that your account opens with 25k, you will be allowed to day trade. The flags are NOT removed, however. Once labeled a day trader, the only way to remove it is to ask your broker (if they allow such things. RH does not.), or to not day trade for 90 days.

The reason that distinction is important is if you are labeled a PDT and fall below 25k, you will still be a PDT, but be subject to the under 25k restrictions of 4 day trades per 5 day window.
I think its 90 days
CRSR getting dangerously close to my stop loss. Not a fan.
Sold 12/18 23c this morning to buy more PLTR calls
Correct, basically like getting paid to open a debit spread.
Setup an onlyfans account
I thought I got out at the top when it hit $500
Hold for the ps5
Roll to slightly OTM, another week or two out
I caved and ended up covering. Never selling CCs on meme stocks ever again. Lesson learned
Hold
im in the same boat about 12/18 calls
imagine hating money so much. just send it here
Were closer to 600 than 500, what comes first?
they put America First, better than the rest of Silicon Valley bending over for China
Theyll sell the call last second if it expires, it wont exercise
How much further do you think? Deciding when to get out or hold till friday
ICLN maybe

 welcome aboard brother.
Yeah but WORK hasn't spiked above $38 since the initial pop. PLTR has been ripping non-stop
How tf did it go up with +26% in a half hour??! I just missed that...
Friendship with China over.  
Now US covert OPs is best friend.
JD has been such a cold bitch to me.

Shut up cuck
Wrong sub boy we cooking tendies not crying into our ramen bowls
jim cramer buy buy buy
its a short day on Friday
They want to sell it because their target prices are at $30.
I'm bout to join you friend. As soon as these 30c's get exercised once PLTR makes it's last run today.
Hopefully bad.
What's your thoughts on this one?  I ended up going with 200 shares which is something I never do but just didn't feel confident with an options play here. I don't think it's going to really pop off until shitecoin hits 20k
Welcome to the club. Shares will be the real winners here in 5 years. Lets get this bag
Spoiler: he was already gay.

With ya in the same boat, in for 200 shares at $25. Sold 35c this morning. Didnt get much premium ($1.14 each) but if it hits $35 im happy with$2000 capital gain.

Pls

Go thicc bee go !!!
That feels a lot like "Meth. Not even once".

I wish you goat fucker

Thanks for the shares
Did the same. Was so upset that I sold from 23.5

Meats back on the menu!

In NIO at 17  
In PLTR at IPO  
in CRSR at IPO
Holiday weekend take your crazy gains and enjoy the weekend.
I just rolled all of my options into shares. Taking a break. Figuring Ill check back in a month to see my next plays. Holidays take up to much of my focus
They all never learn bro just let it happen. Its part of the cycle.
No you retard  and buy the dips
Im gonna try not to but all my money is in Tesla weeklies so dont listen to my dumbass.
Yes! Strike pice and exp date?
Imagine thinking
Wouldnt dip that far unless some damming news came out.
this is just profit taking dude, its extending all over EV, but if youve got solid plays then stay stay until after thanksgiving. I made the mistake around September
Based
He congratulated him on their victory. Donnie and Vlad are crying in the corner.
Sure hope so
You mean a company with actual earnings?

It's been flat for so long. Maybe
Explain to me what PLTR does and i'll do the same
Your father has a ticker?
fuck you
No you are the super retard. Bye bye  
Completely/highly likely, yes
Doesnt seem likely
It hurts.
Calling all pension plans to get in. Lets do it guys and gals! Your union members approve gaming.
no lol won't be till after Q3 earnings at the earliest
Just spam about PLTR like everyone else
Stocktwits 
"Safest bets out there"


nice.
What? What happened?
Fuck you ya god damn liar
37
I sold and panic bought back in and im glad i did lol
What are you talking about ATH? EVERYDAY IS ATH
Do you understand the company? No. Do you understand that one of their old executives is now going to be the director of national intelligence next year? Do you understand their industry? No. But big money does, and theyre piling in because they realize the value of this stock. Go be gay somewhere else
We are below ATH now. Buy?
yea buy now, it's gonna correct to $30.25 by eod friday
Sold mine at 170%.  They are now sitting 300%. FML
bought calls at 19. i sold half at 22 for profit taking, oh well still riding the rocket.
gains are gains brother
I told you not too!.. PLTR is just Ludacris
goof
disgusting, taking profits like that
JMIA is next
From the November-December 1999 issue let me know what happened a few months after that.....
Market and economy arent correlated
Buying calls in his memory!
Thanks internet explorer
ya rip
Now is best time to buy in again
FML I sold at 23
Cause youre fucking stupid
y not both retard
Anyone who yolos a chinese stock deserves to lose it all IMO.
Well there's only one tech company in that list the others are just car companies.
THiCcBoy
are we keep holding or what
Green end of day
There are bad news regarding the hongkong stock market and China again so probably very red today
I dont see much movement with Tuscan bee.. last transaction 12:01. Euro markets are so fucking slow
Yeah bro lets go!
Hcac
Oh no what happened I just woke up I have an 60c4/21 Xpev
the word investigation is not something you want to hear when you invest into something chinese
Market closed tomorrow, and opens late on Friday...Im betting nobody wants to hold through all that
Stock futures are relatively flat
No way people are buying this with Thursday closed
shit ton of economic data drops at 830.
fax but we can just get more before conference in december
[deleted]
why is that crazy? the economy has never been stronger baby!
I will take gayness on dow. Bought 295p eod yesterday
Appl gang unite! EV bois /gquit!
Yeah lol. outside of green energy shit he needs to just shut the fuck up
Lol son?

Cuhz pump and dump
Because you didnt buy enough
Profit taking algos
19.4 k
Roll to 22 and hold till $500
Not that obvious. Remember the 3-day rule.
PLTR
50% PLTR and 50% CRSR
PLTR
CRSR is rock solid, PLTR will get your blood pumping with the volatility
XPEV. 

Full disclosure 12/4 $85c, but that's because I think it's a rocket that will keep printing.
PLTR is offering a nice dip at open and the constant surge of adrenaline due to the ups and downs are better than snorting coke from a crackwhore's asshole
gonna see 300 eoy hopefully
For sure..$700 one as well
I hope not
Let's go I bought the dip yesterday
Ride it out. Add more. Sit back and relax.
Out
Boy that's a hell of a username
I hope youre right bout ev
Anything under $25 is instant buy to 10% of my portfolio for me
Lots of upside from the IPO, and cheap entry point, meme name and decent volume, big players entering positions and government contracts, and its tech. What more do you want. 

22c for Dec expy were only .07c each just a few weeks ago. Theyre now about $5 each. Wish I had gone all in.
There are others?
Happy birthday
Don't worry you can catch it after it goes to $20.
Open
12/18 calls 
My MSFT $200 and Ally $30 calls expired worthless. Ahh the good ole days from the February bull market.
My 3/15 $200c remember
Yeah. I went all in $235C weeklies that week like a jackass and thats the story of the first time I got wiped.
Tbf its not much of a recall. A loose bolt on 6k cars? That shits nothing.
Props to that DD and that doctor who commented in it.
8.8%
\-8.62%, it was -12.15% half an hour ago though. I'm also in it, we'll make it, brother, stay strong.
Staying away from that one even if it means I miss any short time rallies. Doubt they're not gone by 2030.
Likely based on the quad inverse theorem
I am thinking to tbh
Why would we dump if we hedged?  Makes no sense.
How fo i hedge my pltr?
Im bearish and upvoting
It's sad
Institutions need to update their limit orders, what youre seeing is retailer investors and MM fighting to establish a direction for which the asset to move, some are selling a lot are buying.

Got in at open for 100 more shares
I got in late but I just bought, hopefully still room for growth
[deleted]
EOD?
Jeff gotta come with the baddest bitch when he gets remarried. Too much pressure being the richest man
Don't want to be caught with diamond hand
Wondering the same
Pltr wasnt a secret, but most rookies sold when it dropped from $10-$9. I added.
Just check the daily thread.
pumpers
Gauge the market sentiment across all mediums...reddit YouTube boomers family all talking about PLTR thats how you know
Welcome to the rest of the market. Everyone's doing it. Fuck
HOLY SHYITR VXX UP 1% CIRCUIT BREAJERW CRASH AHHHH NOOO GOD

Car that runs off vaped weed
crsr will be at least 60 around Christmas. its that time of the year and many people are switching to desktops instead of gaming consoles.
Lol. That shit has run up 100% in like a week and a half.
Market's closed tomorrow bud.
why would you only do this AFTER we run up this much.
You know the market is closed tomorrow right?
well its a short week so gl
you mean tomorrow on thanksgiving when the markets are closed?
Nobody tell him
Bought it and then it tanked again
I just tossed a grand at next months $45s you happy now?
Congrats on the gains man!
Gains is gains
they also got 3.5x the pe ratio of logi, and logi makes some of the best gamer peripherals (1ms lightspeed wireless keyboards / mice).
I vote yes on this.
What dip
There are two millionaires from this sub on this bitch now. Three actually. One dude 3 mil, DFV the king is a little over that and then another dude with like 1.5m
Gme is probally going to stay range locked in the 12-14.99 range until earnings
priced in
I believe you mean Palantillionaire
Remember , short term isnt important. Next week is
You'll have to go collect it on the moon
true but this isnt WSB stuff
Lol
Wait till EOD or Friday IMO but its up to you
The facts back them up, jump aboard!
i drive a chevrolet movie theater
4 thousand is a lot good for you
Curious, what do you think the standard of this sub is that consists of 1.6 million Reddit accounts?
100%
100 fam
10%
Some people have ego
I took a break from trading and this sub... I just got back on Monday. I feel foolish.
Scared money dont make no money
Thats what I have been saying for a week...
Wrong
Sell a put.  Worst case free money.
if for some reason is dips to 25.50 or below maybe

wait till it hits $30 EOY
I did and its already making money
No dip
Bruh its going up 10% tomorrow too

Incredible to live that long while doing so much coke
Yeah I sold my Li Auto calls for a 30% loss, FOMO'd Palantir at the open and am already up 30% lmao
"Where are the sellers?!" Cramer screams into the void as Peter Theil raises his leg, and screams "This. Is. Palantir!" kicking him in the chest.
60
buy it my g, now is in dip
Charge ya damn phone
100 by 2023
$30 EOY
$75 a year from now. buy a lot and forget about it
What date?
$60 is a market cap of $100B which seems reasonable if theyre profitable this quarter
$50. Bullish PT would be $80.
It does not need to chill 
Waiting for the dip my guy
there are worse things to spend $1000 on.
just remembered where i am. You're not talking actual LEAP's, but jan 2021, aren't you? in that case i would probably wait for some kind of pull back.
THC Bazinga?
Fubo
Just the beginning..
yes
PLTR $100 EOY
won't fuckin matter in 6 months, don't listen to that moron - buy more
No
patience bro
we will be right about too, people just can't read. "will trade flat until the merger is announced in two weeks or so"
They sure weren't correct when I bought 50k in Micron in mid 2018.

But they nailed this one.

Ban
Its the year of 2030, SPCE reaches $1000 as investors are betting on final test flight.
Really? Look at all these Botox stocks. FOMO MOMO UHOH OHNO! 
SUCK IT CRAMER!
Same lmao I scalped some for .03 somehow
Uh it went up 5 bucks on Monday. But past two days have been shit yes
LOL it was 41 last week people here are missing some braincels
Oh yeah well my dad can beat up your dad
Lol that wasn't the top
Same
Ok poindexter
Idk but I bought a couple days ago and it's PRINTINNGGG!
The worse of the rodent business men
Do it
Thought Id be i danger buying at 26 but we good brah
profit is fer losers
If youre a 
yea after lockup period, for now only 
Nah. Ride it.
I bet you said that when Nio was at 28 
Ive been riding PLTR since $16.50 on calls, finally toilet paper handed it at $28.50......thrilled with my profits, and happy for everybody else that maybe makes extra bank on it, but I dont want to be around when the rocket crashes
If you dont have calls/shares
Got in at \~$9.50/share.  Not bad!
1T marketcap by 2025? I'm gonna cum.
Wait a minute...I'm in on IPOC did I pick the wrong one??!
Ban
In the current market you will probably win more than you lose. But how long is this endless pump going to last for.
Buy high sell low you fuck
Diet coke? No.  That's girl shit.
They will next time, so wield your new power wisely.
Of course no one wants to admit it right now
i hope so
Someone buying a lot of calls for next year.
yer butt sore from sitting on the fence for a week?
E
What if it skyrockets past 30 ahh
Then you won.  Don't think of what ifs. Good job, buddy
A fucking PS5? Bro this company basically paid for my car
Same! Now I just need to upgrade my phone lol
Yeah doesnt Microsoft use them too.
I wouldnt even risk it this shit is parabolic
31
4 people gettin it!!!!
Can I suck it ?
This is the way
Real question, how do you have yours set? I'd like to set one so that I can stop staring at my screen but I'm afraid I'll go too tight and get fished out of my positions
Lol not til mid December I ber
Why? Cuz Cramer told you to?

WHERE ARE THE SELLERS AND PROFIT TAKERS?

Welcome to the new world.
Damn you fast as fuck boi
Every time how lol
If NIO goes back to 25, I will get a 3rd mortgage on my house, sell my cars, and cash my shit coins and go balls deep.
You will necer be right.
OH GOD HERE COMES THETA TO CRUSH MY ACCOUNT
Up almost 200% on my Jan PLTR calls, not that worried
2030 leaps on your virginity
Retard cashed out for some ass, have fun with her boyfriend cuck retard
Wait, you cashed out?!
Wouldnt advise .. large buy orders happening
Agree. Holiday sell off, buy more calls at a discount after.
Why 1pm?
Yes but we holding that shit 
no
PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR

Sour skittle
Why would bears be angry 
CRAZY CANDLE
if u dont have a house in there ur retarded lol
I got 500 shares. 10% of my account and feeling like adding another 500
Small player got 50 shares, my loins are ready for fuckin take off 
BUY. THAT. DIP. BUY. THAT. DIP.
!remindme 10 minutes
thre should be a pullback
Why didn't you wait for todays +10% with PLTR?
Wrong
You sold crsr?!! 

Theyre gonna pump it now
6 months ago the stock didnt even exist retard
Except it listed less than 3 months ago
You'd be a fucking wizard considering their IPO was 2 months ago
Those calls werent available to us, no IPO til October
hardly. looking at most leaps they have been everything from 2 to 7 baggers. not enough for millions but yeah, still good
It literally was not a stock at that time so no.
God damn you're retarded
The stock didn't exist to the public 6 months ago.
No, but I got a 10 bagger already for 17c expiring in May
no you wouldn't
VIX not doing shit though
donny always calls the top
Do it you coward
Well considering the day hasnt opened yet you are counting your chickens before they hatch
Ok keep buying PLTR until 400 guys. Then short it.
PLTR should also have 5oo bil market cap because: reasons
in what space of time
Im pretty sure he had pre dumped it. That was one of the concerns of palantir so thats already priced in.
Seriously 
you're gonna be sad

This shit hitting 365 eod
its banned
under 1billion market cap
It is a a microcap.  Maybe it will be allowed once the acquisition occurs.

We uncover the rocket and then at 35 we press launch.
We party till it hits 40
Push to 40 duh
Took a look at their car and knew to stay the hell away.
Would wouldn't you just buy it at market for the cost an extra fucking cent?
Whats the problem
Yeah you cheap fuck why wouldn't you just buy it when it was under $11 all day yesterday
Theyre investigating *two* specific companies according to that article.
Its one company nothing to do with the big dogs fake news
Yessss
Truth. If the motherfucker can land rockets on barges hes the most likely option to solve self driving.
Elon seems to have figured that out, which is why hes going in the direction of self driving cars and batteries. Theres also that Uber service hes hinted at before.
Very much so. The Taycan shows that VW isn't sitting around twiddling its thumbs. Tbh much of the Tesla lane assist tech, other automakers have always had. Teslas just felt more confident using it for things like autopilots where germans refuse to take any risks.
Is this some kind of EV stock?
Best ones ??
REITS are garbage to own. The way to make $$$ in real estate is to sell. The holding years are lean with depreciation.
Under 1 billion market cap, even if legit not allowed. Kangaroo thread here
Be mods love gay sex
Wsb conspiracy. Pump all you money into it on open
"pump and dump" because people cant read DD
 No idea
Yall had theta gang sweating for a minute
I think were in for a pullback actually, gonna inverse this
Buy puts end of November typically crashes while December moons. Wait for the dip ride puts down then ride your calls to tendie land in December
Look at the chart
Ikr, having calls is painful
CRSR would probably be safer since PLTR didn't show profit taking yet.
Pltr
Plate
Buy both. But buy more CRSR to bump that thing higher, plz.
why did CRSR drop off the face of the earth just now

can you report stonks?
People grabbing profits and leaving up some dip
Retards don't understand SPAC
Probably worried it counts as a penny-stock pump and dump.
Dumb, a gamble is a gamble.
To protect retards from a potential pump and dump.
Because you can't trade options on it
h-hi
99.999999999999999%
Probable.
At this point probably hold through the 10:30 dip and sell right around 1:30
I had $18 calls and just sold those initial calls, took my initial investment, and then Yolod the profits on way more 12/18 $26 calls
Yes
No
Yes, though has potential to be a 30$ stock
100
it be increasing thats all
They are going after government contracts. There is no limit especially if they use their tech for intelligence
100
It's a meme stock. P/E means nothing. Sky's the limit.
100 EOY
500 EO2021
1,000 EO2025
Just remember there is Different combinations to win, sucks but youll make it
i went to 12/24 it needs to slow and dip a bit somewhere in there
probably. go at least a week further
no less ambitious than the 11/27 29c's I just picked up
Not at this rate.
Lol ok
"But she's only done it in a bull market"
Its because I bought shares
dont be scared until it drops below the 9 day SMA and stays under for a couple 5min candles
huge buying opportunity there indeed
And we do like it
You clearly didnt google anything. Operation Warp-speed is going to use their software for distribution
Duh
PLTR big data ran the numbers and found a solution to global warming.
Pltr software will be used on the vax distribution
THC-B gonna skyrocket with all this Palantir money in peoples pockets looking for the next play
PLTR pivoting to PLTR
Im just in awe at What pltr is doing
yeah
Fuck no. 

Although I probably should.
what are you thinking. 30c for 12/4 or higher?
BUY MORE
I couldn't buy PLTR today when it was 25 because of technical issue that I still can't buy anything
you might be able to pay for the dinner of your wife and her boyfriend
it'll be back to 26.75 by eod
It was the smart thing to do. I love PLTR, but this price will drop down within a few days. Just buy back in when it does.
No. :)
It's gonna keep going up over 100, there's still time to buy the next dip
I sold my calls early too, but listen! Profits are profits. Count your blessings. Go grab some lunch and take a break from the charts
I just bought a Porsche Panamera 4S Turbo...thank you PLTR!
Riiiight
Fuck that, hold fast, and just buy more when it dips
you see PLTR dropping to $12? 

what are you smoking
Lmao
You were saying?
Where you at now fuckface
just buy the dip bro
Get help, seriously
Cant win them all bud
you made money and want to kill yourself?  call the fucking hotline bro
Money is money. I sold my PLTR when I was 32 dollars up. Kicking myself too but I'm happy that I made something
fomo = homo. You made money, what's there to be sad about? Palantir could've nosedived in October if Biden said something negative about big data

you didn't know, so you felt safer buying shares.
New opportunities Every. Single. Day.  

Here's ur insult: You're doing great sweetie
You made money.  Stop being a fucking beta.

Sell half your shares.  Buy $50Cs.

You're fine.
You still made money. There will always be opportunities to make more money. See a therapist please.
As hollow as this probably sounds right now, you still made money.  Look at the epic loss porn posted here and try to get some perspective. 

You've still got plays to make in the future, and you've still got yourself
We have all had those plays. When BLNK tanked to $5-6 dollars I bought so many calls and shares, I dipped after they recovered into $9-10 range. I bought one ZM call the day before earnings when it popped $100, but I sold before close. Would have netted 10k on a 1k play. I bought Nio shares ago and sold.
There's gonna be more. You have to risk money to make money. You couldve easily lost your money too. You can't get upset about not making more
Ive made a dozen bad calls, either selling too soon or buying too late. Im still deeply red all time due to the September dip where I hedged nothing and kept waiting for a bump that never came. Im red in a once in a decade, or even lifetime, black swan event and clawing my way back to even. Profit is profit. I wish I had learned that sooner. Be proud of your profit.
Dude...look forward.. take emotion out of it...every day literally bring these kinds of trades. I congratulate you for not YOLOing. it shows mental toughness.
Just get back on the pony!
There will always be more opportunity bro, believe it or not. Never give up
Dont sweat that shit bro youll get another chance with all the meme stocks around here or just throw 10k now and see what it can do from this point. None of us could have ever predicted this run so if anything take it as a lesson to never doubt your intuition from now on.
You want some real real wake up juice in your brain? PLTR wont be your last opportunity to hit a million. Just regroup and relax. Let those feelings wash over you and be ready for the next one. You know the feeling , that feeling in your bones when somethin is right. Now you doubled up and have a new 10k to set aside when the time is right. Blowing your brains out because you missed a play is big dumb and its all fee fees man just let it pass through you and over you and its gonna be okay.

I havent been doing this long at all Im new and one of my first plans I missed would have netted me 300k+. Am I pissed? Yes. Very pissed. But theres more
I had 300 shares at $11 which I accidentally sold at $17 trying to set a stop loss. Yesterday I bought a couple hundred at ATH, ended bigly red, and sold this morning at a loss 
Hey man go easy on yourself.  Talk to someone.  Get help.  Its going to be okay. 

Regarding the money, its just money.  There will be tons of other opportunities.  You made profit, thats a win.  Im kicking myself for selling Nio calls way to early, but its okay.   We get desensitized being on here, but 10k is a huge win in my books.  

If trading causes you too much stress seek more traditional forms of investing.
Sounds like you made money on shares? Gains are gains, bro. The gains you made on those shares are still light years ahead of any other stock you could have bought. Be happy. You were right and you made money.
A profit is a profit, never count "what I could have had"
Yes
100%
Gains are gains
Found the guy who didnt get in LOL
based
Mad cuz didn't fomo
As someone who bought in at PLTR ipo and was ridiculed on this sub, suck it newbies

I also bought NIO at $5, held as it dropped down to $2.50, then sold at $6 cause its a scam company but hey we dont talk about that
U mad bro?
Bears mad
The people who dont have positions in PLTR are Fomoing real hard
Because some salty person has a very sad life lol
Wow you're dumb
Fuck that. Don't borrow the money if you don't want to pay the loan. We ain't paying for your worthless education.
Aye
Your dick fell off when pltr dipped didnt it
Of course wtf


nah, sorry
We only do idiotic here
Maybe wait for Friday
Hate that absolute moron
TSLA is worth more than almost all the major car brands COMBINED. Valuation has little meaning this day and age based on actual fundamentals. Don't fight it.
Thats my opinion of any of the evs except tsla because at least Tesla envisions itself as the iPhone of cars in which case most will have one. Still retarded but at least a somewhat justifiable evaluation.
sorry you missed the run, but at least you're still poor!
Aint nobody holding dem bags!
Retards don't understand SPAC
It's ok, you're hurting enough already
Nah just a 
no
Fuck no man, 25 EOD
Until they wont get an abortion...
Buy PLTR
Soft accent? Bro they sound mildly retarded. Lived in the south my whole life that cute accent gets old real quick.
LMAO! Wife is brunette. Can confirm.
Holy fuck their accent is terrible. I can barely even hook up with one because they're so fucking annoying
Fine. Ill buy more
Id sell a kidney
No chance
Oh no stocks are down 1-2% after mooning 20-30% over the last 5 days /s smh 
Spy 918 eow
Im for sure buying NIO at the dip
I bought 100 shares at $13... I hate myself for not buying more but half got stolen from me when a stop loss hit after earning Im holding these last 50 shares until I die now
you are gay-er for not buying
Salty
feel sorry for you gf 
same wtf
Buy both.
Ronald Mcdonald house?
Yea, but only to help Elon get to number 1 spot quicker.
Yeah.
Make a twitch account and use your prime sub on yourself steal $2.50/month from that cuck
Theyll sell us the rope. Bless.
Nice you were born beta 
Sold yesterday 
It's up so much today, TH\`CB is a better buy today.

cause those are the only  matches that are actually willing to talk to you
Where Im from bumbles better than tinder lol
Lol maybe they dont get much social interaction and just want to talk to you you autist
This is why I got out of holding calls that expire EOW, I make dumb moves when it gets volatile 100% in an hour lol
So Tesla upsies crayola god?
they forgot about 2nd stimulus during this market pump. Back when the market was low(Oct 20-31), remember how important stimulus was? SMFH
These guys are clowns on squawk today.
Prepare for the greenest day you've ever seen in your life. A homeless dude told me that this morning, so its gonna happen
Yes (no, but they are out of favor for hot money, so yes)
Still time
They are legit company with products. And please tell me what $ amount cut off defines a penny stock? GE, Ford, AMC?
It will dump to 270 if I hold, and moon to 285 if I sell. Im fucked either way
LOL bruh, there were so many autists warning you not to invest in BABA over the span of days dude
Maybe theyll give you a discount
Find your inner retard and listen to whatever it tells you
Yolo into solo
This just in: you hate money
Thank you for your contribution to the rocket fuel.
good move
if by red you mean green, then yes
 
That means we all profit today if that  ticker is up
Sold my puts right at open for $3333 profit, nice, I even did a market order lol
Everyone pulling out to go all in on PLTR
Haha lemme know when its $16 again. That's a sale ill buy.
This is SPARTA

Hope you learned your lesson

Hey fam what's good?? Bought at the tippy top like a BOSS.

Happy Turkey day

Take the profits on the 20c my dude
Yeah Im in a similar boat...just tryna to time it right so I dont lose too much profits while closing and opening the positions
How far are you otm?
Its down 5 points not 5%....
Could have an allergy
AWS has crashed trying to count Bezos wealth going up at this very moment
30c 12/31 is where its at.
Well at least you weren't at a meeting during open because you had to explain what direction up was to some indian guy.

Piling on record amounts of debt while the housing market is on the verge of a crisis is not bullish.

Giving big investors 2008 vibes all over again.
Priced in who tf doesnt know the real estate market is going crazy???
You "sold"? What's that mean?
What date in December?
better question is to ask why it was going up.
? They were always expensive. Ive been selling calls as this week, huge pull back today I bought them all back
This guy knows how to trade
smart move, what was your dollar cost avg
Use that to buy more stonks
Is that a joke?
Nice
ok. youve been pushing this, lets see what it do
Thinking the same
Me too man my SQ calls just went green! (217.5c 11/27)
To late to get in?
How much time you got pal?
Always
Thats nothing lol
At what ask?
You know volume since an hour ago is 55 MILLION?
i donno but its a strong buy for shares
282
I dunno. I've been expecting it to push 15 again by next week, and it seems to be doing just that. I wouldn't short until it does.

But I'm also kinda stupid.
believe when I say.... I want a Green Day
No... Wait yes... No
About as stupid as me  \\\_()\_/
Just took profits on 12/18's
Bears are like junkies waiting for the next hit

Pltr calls damnit

Hold till 100
I would sell with the holiday tomorrow harder to know what will happen and you got really lucky with those strike prices very ambitious.
I just bought the CRSR dip

My head is still underwater on BLNK from buying in at 28.71
need this
whats a gamma squeeze
How do you determine that?
What is a straddle
take those tenders straight to the lambo dealer
254 is 254. Ive been victim of not pulling out/taking my profits and gotten burned. 
Or just say fuck it and keep your rock hard cock belly deep in the bears daughters. Bust a nut in there while youre at it too.
Same odds as your wife slamming her bf tonight
1000%

Yesterday on treasuries.  Yield finally decided to stay put so pretty green day today.
Im addicted to SPY puts after 1.5% green days 

Luckily I also listened to the PLTR shills
Ive quadrupled my account in the past week. Shit is insane
Might be safe due to the holiday
Salty bears downvoting.

How many guys were getting bearish and bought puts yesterday?
Yes
please tell me you're joking.
Think youve been halted homie
You dirty dog. Congrats 
It might dip down to $150 in March. Buy it then.

are you not paying attention??? P L T R hands down
Can this keep going?
Y?
I talked the talk but didnt walk the walk 
Loaded the fuck up
with bid ask spread as wide as $60 -$90 bucks, some retard sold me WORK puts at the bid and i got em cheap for one hundo each..then sold them at ask minutes later for 198 each 
Sir this is a casino
12.3% according to Fidelity
Factset shows 17.54%
11.99% per yahoo finance
Holy fuck
Put 2 grand into it.

I've used Zoom, Teams, and Slack. 

Slack is miles fucking better from a UI perspective and it tapping into the Salesforce ecosystem?? STONKS GO UPPPP
Stop Loss order
I liked the James Bond song even nobody else did.
yea, what usually happens is stock keeps going up. then they go down a little bit, just enough for everone to panic, only to skyrocket once again
Nothing, its all pr like the countdown to midnight clock
gotta be greedy to make money. If I listened to CNN for everything, Id still be scared of COVID-22
We all get flairs by our name???
also extreme greed makes sense. Vaccine news and good outlook with cheetoh leaving. We'll have someone actually generating jobs for Americans rather than someone thats taking loans out on Americas Merrit
just keep going up until they add a new segment called ultra greed then a newer one called mega tendies
GME is cheap enough to buy shares vs calls

if its really the short squeeze of the century to rival TLRY, getting out of shares will be much easier and should still land buckets of money.
How? Its been going up for the last 3 weeks...
It's all about the shares
1/15 and 2/21 how your hands
1500% at least
AMD, TSLA, PLTR, CIIC, SPCE, AMZN what else?
Easily my favorite play
if it was by next week you would get attention, next year might as well be another planet on WSB
Who tf really knows with this shit
buy em back pussy
Oof, did you get some juicy prem from it at least?
We are not too yet.
Top? There's no top buddy
keep
Keep until it reaches 69
Sell to me you dumb dumb
Leaps lol, you ride that shit out man
Hold
sell at 300% no less
You gotta hold onto those baby PLTR aint stopping soon 
Paper hands right here
30 EOD
I sold my 11/27 23c yesterday.
Why are you not immediately buying MGNI calls?
you probaly regret it already?
Why are you such a  ?
Better than selling it at $24 like me lol 
Dude, sold at 24 this morning expecting a pull back. I am sick to my stomach
How much you make?
Me too
Bro I said my 25c earlier thinking this run was over. Good thing I still have leaps or I wouldve been hating myself
GAINZ BRO
Buy back in, never too late with this one
Same I cant even look anymore
shhhhh no doom and gloom, thats how you get ants
I too watched margin call
Why not sell at $40?
In this market? Nothing makes sense bro, find something you believe in and buy.
Nothing makes sense silly

Sorry to hear it man. Thats a rough one. At least its not a realized loss. Chin up lad
username doesnt check out
not so fearless? its ok move on they are other plays
Sucks man. Youll probably never get another chance like that for the rest of your life.
NAK?
huh, thats actually surprising
*Raises hand*

Model Y.

Didnt sell it all though. That would be stupid. Sold just enough to keep my car payments reasonable.
 Couldnt do it when I calculated how much Id make keeping the money in calls. ..  I rent an S from Turo guy when I need my fix...
All the money I was going to drop into a model 3 back in January, I dropped into the stock instead 
Think the profits have turned into 2 model 3s at this point
Brass monkey is for ugly chicks
if MM are getting out of options EoD, what does that mean for people holding options till friday?
PLTR
lots of things are better than porn tbh
6 is not that deep

thats what she said
get ready to exercise that shit retard
It was a sell at 50. Correction ahead. Same with PLTR once the hype dies down.
Where
to what?
show gains
Do you just sell the contract or excise it.. kinda new to option trading. What if you dont have the funds at end of contract?
Post gains
Turns out it was his brother and they are now stuck in a loop
Everything PLTR turns to gold so, yes
Just buy and don't look back until December.
you are not alone...bought and sold 300 shares all week..have none now...sigh
My $35C expiring in 2022 at about to hit this month, possibly this fucking week 
I'm up 1k on Jan calls I bought today but have no day trades left. I'm riding this rocket all the way. 
^ Loser buying late gives winners advice on what to do
I said that with xpev at 40 bro
Did it hurt having your balls removed?
Hold or buy more
bruh
this scares me but i wanna ride should i pussy out
Nope
Crying in a corner
like is this going to correct
PLTR IS THE NEXT FUCKING TSLA 
What's embarrassing is that you think buying puts = shorting a stock.
Only if you like losing
any time you like man. dont be greedy
Did you make profit? If so, Sell when you're ready. Don't wait too long and get burnt. Personally 40% and up, Sell.
Hah, who knows
There was a sell wall at 28 and 29 that got blown through. The one at 30 is even smaller.
Well if you really think about it, pltr
It finally seems to have broken 50$ resistance. There doesn't seem to be anything but good news for vaccines moving forward which should help. Once I saw it was about to break 50 I grabbed 5 1/15/21 60$ calls that I feel like will print so take my opinion as you will.
Wait dont do it!

First you gotta take me out.
370 on Monday. Bears are so dead
Your whole post history is a series of disaster trades
Dude you have a post you made where you talk about being balls deep and how shady that shit is

Stop pumping it moron

You also invested in HYLN like an idiot
Hahaha imagine
Biggest Black Friday ever
Wsb is full of autists but stocktwits is a whole other level of retardation
Should I start checking it out to see what to inverse?
That's literally what's happening.
You have shares? If yes hold, if not sell.
That stock is for gays, makes sense you would be a buyer
How bigs the wall at 23
Aw how cute. He thinks MM have feelings
Gross
It's down though.
Its rising rn?
So fun losing money I love it omg
lol "dip" +2%.. man I love that I hopped on that train early last week

How did I miss this
Today seems good for mara
MARA TO THE MOON

Thats a good plan same here

Disclaimer: own both
Worst decision ever
Great product imo, shoutout ot the DD guy
Cashed out at 17.80 for 15% profit on 300 shares. Gonna wait for a pullback, SPAC mania is cooling rn
They sell peanuts
They make peanuts. The spokesman is a peanut, fake funeral, etc.

Doesnt matter because itll double before we can even get it
Yeah, you can't even say "why is there a dick inside me" anymore to your stepbro without people looking at you strange
Hell yeah


Everyone sleeping on JWN. I love it.
Mods trying to keep this place from not being a total fucking bucket shop
Last rocket was literally a perfect cup and handle too. LFG
That cup and handle went the wrong way
That's because it's their fiduciary responsibility not to YOLO your entire portfolio into PLTR and Chinese EV stocks.
They're the retards selling all these calls to hedge positions
Do you think god will be like, you used your hand didnt you?
Hate seeing news like this for the first time in the WSB daily thread. Feels so filthy to me.
when will you learn

ALL $500 of it eh?
       
were going to be rich!
Why was it banned?
can you spell it out but backwards?
nope but not too late to get in
Probably tomorrow or Friday but who knows where we will be then
Dip green dildos on gay bears for sure
It just did
Will test 29 by EOM. If it breaks that psychological barrier, which at this volume rate it looks like, who knows how retarded it will get. PLTR lock up is due to expire around Feb, so those who are buying Jan calls are fucking wizards.
Get a second mortgage on the house and throw it on pltr, kinda obvious play
top is in bois, u can dump it now
Dont do it
Imagine your wife going to WSB to get you investing advice. That is a spicy 7 layer oof dip
Doesnt get more retarded than that
Let her cook, dont ruin it bruh bruh
Yeah it usually comes online for power hour.
And everyone was hating on that poor boy n his DD
Nice, BUT NO PULL BACKS STONKS ONLY GO UP
Same.
lol who knew being greedy doesnt buy you happiness!?!?!?
Sell some and let the rest ride
wow congrats

Markets are swinging back in to tech bc vaccine still isnt coming for a hot minute. I would hold, but youre essentially playing chicken with good vaccine news. Vaccine news will slaughter you. But until that point it should be green

This like the fifth time AMD has been $87 in the last three months.
Eh, I could see this coming back. I might sell off tomorrow or eod though assuming it does just to wait and see
Its PLTR
Anything under $30 is a bargain
Get in now. No reason it shouldn't be 40 by February. Just hold through and it'll print
Buy now or watch it go up
Fuck it I feel the same way but fuck it
I'm in there with you. Genkidama!
It's just turning back up again.
So fuckin great of an opportunity, just doubled all my positions
Healthy pullback
dude it needs to stop once in a while to let more people hop onto the tendy train. don't panic every dip day but buy into them.

last thursday was a pump which means shorts have 10 trading days to close their short positions. they have till next friday.  I would think about an exit thursday or friday, especially if we pop above 15. I don't think earnings are going to push GME up.
It doesn't matter, seems like it's just stuck at 275, trying to break through that imaginary wall.
it moves slow, but atleast it moves up

I DCA'd at 45. Honestly anything below $50 is a steal. This stock still has a long way to go.
Thas probably it
Buy now, buy more if it goes lower. COVID means staying at home and binging twitch/youtube/onlyfans.
Read the dd post again.
Secret DD. Yesterday on the way to work I saw four (4!) Fdx trucks in a row on the highway. Calls for days

Only 50m?
No only the tax arm of credit karma
Nothing has been announced.

Weak hands
Keep pumping, I need to offload my AAPL calls on the next poor bastard
Been stagnant long time. Was just waiting to shine
Black Friday is on Friday
Consumer spending up .. also its done nothing for weeks, might be expectations for Black Friday / cyber Monday shipping
Just do more cocaine
Because people have lives and families
Day before thanksgiving. PLTR and TSLA rockets need to refuel on turkey
i dont know what this means
Would that have anything to do with volume of the individual options and liquidity. What ticker
Maxed out against you?  Sometimes you have to go .05 over the actual spread to get it done in that situation.
19 but place it on a European wheel (1 less zero)
deposit more
$30c 4/16/21 reporting in. Up about 46% and counting.
Yep without Vaseline
Bought at 17.99 and my only regret is not buying more
575
Obviously nobody fucking knows, but normally after thanksgiving the market pumps. It is 2020 though, keep in mind.
Who tf cares. Sounds like gravy and its thanksgiving so lets go boys!
You know. With turkey.
someone did DD on GRVY yesterday and the first thing I saw was Ragnarok Online and I thought it was dumb af

Boy was I wrong, the weebs are strong
CRSR is long play. Years.
Going to drop when dividend is paid out
I told you idiots about his stock. I have made so much money off it in the past week. And I bought 2K shares today, bc I want the 3K lol. I know QVC HSN ZUILLILY very very very well. They are making money hand over fist.
More info. This company doesnt grow or sell weed. Just grow supplier.
You think this will boom?
It went up with SPY AH, its an extremely ish sign. Last time they moved together it was September
Dxy is ski sloping down too
because you touch yourself at night
Market closed tomorrow
>turning the corner.

Something their vehicles probably can't do very well.
Why?
I sold $30s last week when that was the highest strike. It only took me one day to regret it.
An autist has money to spend because his s frugality is reflected in the massive amount of dominos deliveries, tards are tards
Autists win and retards lose.
retard: yolo's on meme weeklies

autist: refuses to take profits when they should
Am autist would be too smart to answer that question.
It's the same picture
Yeah it's kind of silly.  Bloomberg has been super bearish on airlines last 2 days so why not go straight up.
The direction is down
flat to up as always.
In 3 weeks or so when I buy to close the rest at $40
Crap. With all the other action I forgot I meant to look into this today.
Still rising you think?
Sure
today
Something about a disease making the rounds
You should be in TCEHY and NTES over BIDU. BIDU hasn't shown good performance in a while and it's prospects are dim.

I'm about 90% China in my portfolio, it's going to make fucking bank in 2021.
No way man, wait until they release their black friday stats, this is THE time to get in if you aren't.
Equities go up.
buy?
In on this with shares and monthlies
I cashed out At $11 when I got in at $3... I might go back in.. or has the shipped left me already? 
FSR the move!!

Fcel will drop in an hour or two
Good earnings result
earnings
you are crazy to sell BABA atm imo
There will be pushback on the way to 300 but timing it's hard. If you just want some super safe % gains it's easier to just leave it in there and come back in Jan.
Depends on Expiry! If it expires Friday, I will say take your profit. Wait if it's in Dec
I took profits at 277

Holy shit i just bought 130c for 12/24 and was even slightly nervous

give a strike and expiry
Tvs

Useless its not the same if there are no stakes in it. Just like poker playing make pretend doesnt train you against yourself.
Trading 212 is often recommend, although I've only had a brief look at it.

I'm poor too but deal only with these meme stocks instead of options, up 53% before brokerage/fees the last three months.
Yeah wtf
I liked the video where the roof blew off on the highway 
TSLA's so hot right now their cars are on fire? Bullish.
Teslas going up in flames = more demand = stonk price goes uppies. Principle of scarcity my dude.

Wow yeah, heart attack. May you rest in peace Diego. A true legend of the game. The Maradona documentary is brilliant for those who haven't seen it.
RIP
Yeah hope this holds. Price action this morning and yesterday was annoying. I hold to my original suspicion yesterday that a lot of money that would've continue to buy up TGT was used to play the EV crap. Now that that seems to have popped a bit the money's going back. This spike looks like the opposite of the dump late morning yesterday.
Sounds like you're trying to *sell* a call by mistake
MKe sure youre actually on the buy side & not the sell side of the call section
Youre trying to sell a call idiot
Sell now. Theta still takes your profits even on days the market is closed
If you're asking its because you already know,
Yeet
I hope so, got in this morning!
Expiry is the only that matters. SNAP's new bottom in 3 months is $80
In.
DKNG and AAPL calls
DKNG better
Its actually a profitable business, we cant have that here.
Sounds normal
But... wtf is it?
lol. last time they had a dividend, the stock was at 9.40 and dropped to 4.70. you can keep the dividend, thanks - i'll put my money in PLTR where it'll work
are you trying to [sell the dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend-selling.asp#:~:text=Dividend%20selling%20is%20a%20dishonest,will%20soon%20pay%20a%20dividend)? Lol
Oh, and Go Heels 
No. U loose on one & win on the other. Depending on how wide your spread is & how much u bought/sold it for, youll make a little bit or loose more. But dont let that happen. Unless u want assignment/exercise. Close that shit out, even for a loss. The less extrinsic value, the higher probability u will be a/e. Do some research, dont get caught in the middle.
sell contract OTM it can't be exercised so yeah
You mean $600?
When I bought calls everyone said I was crazy... up 53% in 2 weeks. :-)
Place your price closer to the bid*

Chargepoint has a large footprint but theres no technical moat to their product outside of first mover advantage.
Unfortunately I sold my sbe before takeoff, was in at 13 and sold at 18.5.
 Whoops. Chargepoint is a great company but the deal is for a very small portion of the company, and it's likely going to plummet at merger. I plan to buy in if it hits 16$
I did the same and sold 520p's to force me back in later
Same. +319% wont get me down
I got out this morning. Yawn.
Its go for launch.. I hope

Few years? PLTR will make you rich
AAPL is gay
Selling to close? Then you have nothing to worry about
You sell the rights back you free and clear. Your closing an option you bought right. Not selling an option .
Once you sell a call that you bought. You are no longer in control. You keep profits
3k in work calls expired worthless last Friday. Really thinking about $rope right now. Would have been a millionaire.

Why not. This market is so whacky today

There should be almost no way that AMZN closes below 3200 this year, it would be nutty. Act appropriately.
I think so
Is that a good brand? Trying to get my boss something for Xmas so he doesnt fire me for spending all my time on Reddit.
you don't have to.
idk but just remember that the market closes 3 hrs early on friday
Me. Been pretty much exclusively trading MYOV since Dec 2019.
In the same boat.
Probably because theres no one on the bid side
If they're depressing you to look at you can always close them for 0.00$  
Been there, done that.
Tf this mean
sell, you don't want to risk bagholding with 0dte calls if it pulls back. in fact, i'd probably sell now and roll that shit out to like fuckin april
Pltr for sure
Thats a wild strike but Kramers boomer homies will be back after thanksgiving to buy more if you wanna wait and see

Dude this is like the 100th times youve posted to sell, shut up
Suck a fat one
yes, on margin too
I'll give it a moment to get dippier.
Paper handed idiots
Once the tard spam got stopped of course it would dump - its a shitty SPAC
SPY hasn't bought TSLA yet dumbass
No its not you tard
Lol, no. minor dip, 30 eoy easy.   


Load up or miss out
Love me some +6% crash.
Aaaaand we are back on track keep pumping dont paper hands this
Yeah crashing at high velocity on the moon
Who gives a fuck about TikTok, what are they gonna do? Buy 4 shares today and sell them on Monday when theyre not +200%?
Why would you do this?
Kiss your money goodbye

KEKW.  bro why do you hate money?!?!
Hahaha the top for 10 minutes
I sold at $28.20 i feel good about it. for now.
the temporary top
i just took some gains from this. $10k. I will buy that dip when it comes tho.
Quickly buy it back bro
the market is a non-sentient being that a bunch of retards throw too much money into
ZM earnings on Monday. Could be a lot of sympathy going into next week.
overnight after two days of bigly pumping
My portfolio has been meme stocks for past 2 weeks
Call the mods faggts and you will be
Yes,  you were banished to an alternate reality
Yeah youre fucked lmfaoo

Its okay jeffery
Ban
r/cringetopia
It will moon forever. Get the fuck in!
You could have said the same thing this morning, why tf would you buy after back to back 13% gains, or yesterday why tf you getting in when it just had a 13% day? You gotta get in sometime, and if you buy out long enough a 5% drop/consolidation isnt gonna matter whatsoever
1. yes.
2. stonk go up.
Only goes up bro
Its really a 50-50 chance it moons one more time or pulls back lol. Quite literally gambling
Yes
Bro it does that every day tho look at its history
Try 161% in a month
Carmageddon was such a sweet game
sell a couple of shares
I would have some baba stuff going, not a lot...but some
Buying opportunity from whatever God (winnie the pooh) China worships
Cant pick a direction until economic data comes out
Same. Thought we would recover a little today. Nope.
He boomed me. That fucking NIO boomed me.
Shes gonna have to move rather quickly in the next 15 minutes then ...
Stonks only get 1 good day
Retards who overleveraged on weekly meme fds.
FSR
EOSE
HCAC, AKA Bangbus SPAC
Xi coming for a larger piece of that pie.
And that investigation does NOT include NIO, LI, or EXPV.
Whats better to snag tesla or pltr
I think even flat is a win at this point.
EV bears feasting though
The market overall is flat but all the stocks WSB is in are crashing double digits today.
For fucking real...Ill be pissed if it moons again
 Gang
Calls but make sure they're itm
Puts

You just lombard lend it if you need spending cash. shit's gonna pay for every single holiday of my life
SQUEEZE
Hell yeah bro. All Ive posted is about how I hate their stupid fucking name, theyre coming in clutch this morning though along with pltr. Thanks Mister Fiskeryou awfully named fuck
CRSR getting ready for the turn around, discount is here. Get in before 930 launch

You're retarded
Told you
fomo all homo
No. To everything you thought.
Yeah I did that the other day. Fucking pussy move.
I refuse to invest in AMZN outside of ETFs. Such an unethical company. Vote with my investment account.
Jeffrey just needs to announce a fucking stock split so we can moon
Jumped in it twice this AM.  I cant find *any* news on this dump, so Im hoping its profit taking.
Theyre shares retard, hold
hold

monday will be monstrous green
Markets are open Friday
The market is open Friday. Until 1pm
Market open Friday
Hold it! Why would you sell shares?? If it was December calls would be a different story, but these shares will be worth a lot in a couple months!
Fucking why?
Congrats my friend. I know the feeling
December 18 calls safe?
jan 15 calls are so expensive though.
This is the way
I did this at the September top, paid big money for near the money November calls and I was down -98% until last week, broke even. 

This feels like it might be the top.
Facts, sitting on 35% cash dont know what to get in right now
I respect your honesty kind retard
Hows the green dildo feeling up your ass?
Few weeks dont miss out on my gainz
Y2K bug
i have a put. it's down 70% today.
Just dont

braver men than you have died tryin
Check the news retard
Youre depressed you made money??  Cmon man. Green is green. You made money!!!!  Profit is profit
This is a toxic line of thinking.  
You don't know the future.  
You can't go back in time.  
You just made 10k.  
  
Smile dude.
Keep playing your cards right. We all want to be a millionaire in a day and snort coke off your wife while her boyfriend watches. 10k is 10k you didnt have.
Just buy them now
Hindsight is 20-20, you will have a lot more of those couldve-wouldve-shouldve situations in the future. Nobody goes broke taking a profit. gj on the gains brother
Dont sweat it man. Theres gonna be lots of other opportunities, remember to make money in this market look forward, not behind. Theres always another shot, and if you still believe in Palantir go for it! Im loaded on leaps and shares for 2021/22, heres to hoping we can still be millionaires
what is stop.

what is loss.
Make like youre about to sell your contract and hit the gear icon top right on the page were you set the limit price.
Fuck no were only going up from here
Dont go broke trying to time a short on this
IV will rip your balls off
Whats the strike
you get the fuck out now dingus. you lose a day and a half to theta.
lol this friday? you better sell that shit immediately. buy something further out.
Sell the call
How many Chinese people drive Fords?
Dont fight the trend idiot
None of that matters as long as the numbers are green this sub will buy.
All the way to 4000 
The prices are not reflecting the current sales, it's all about the future. EV is touted as the successor to these older manufacturers and there for the new kids on the block are being bought up as the future leaders.

Take Tesla out of that as well as it's not simply a car company, Its hardware, software, networking, AI, battery, etc. Wedbush gave it a bullish target of $1000 this week.
TSLA has tequila and surfboards. That is diversity 
its part of the pump & pump
it was literally under $4 for like 6 months
I love you. Whats EOD looking like ?
You aint black if you dont!!
120
It seems like a huge run up, but we've seen 1000+% runs. It just IPOed, it's possible this is just the start.
Nah try 60$
so true
that commie stock is done
Yes and short day on Friday i believe it closes at 11am
Yes
I tried to tell you guys!!!! Soros lined up orders on Level 2
calls u retard
Both good choices depending on where you're putting it, I would go calls for now tho
Should of held 
SPY -3% please
It's the only way bears know how to communicate lately, by downvote. They're too choked up to actually comment. Sad.
In your bottom oder?

3 day week...(Friday doesnt count in my eyes)
Targets 23/22.25/21/20
There were like 900.000 orders stop limit in $20 (2 days ago). I doubt it will break it, but market is wild
I will buy back for 18,50
Thinking about this while watching it go up over the last week
Nah it won't be a meme stock. Just good, steady, justified growth
Why have I not seen DD on MGNI?
Saturday and Sunday
Tomorrow and early close Friday
absolutely nothing more bullish than bearish sentiment. thank you bull gods
Or bull trap ready to remove heads and horns  
PLTR
CRSR, PLTR
Tastytrade or IBKR for options bro
TH\`CB, it is one of the best EV plays now that is new to the market.
Etsy
Not dumb stonks only go up
Yed
This is the way
Good calls on NIO today
Nio puts all the way?
felt cute and shorted a few xpev shares. already up seconds later
Bro you really dont know the proper usage of there, their, and theyre please go back to the second grade
Sauce
Are they doing that? 
Well every other president has done so he gets his turn.
https://youtu.be/7u8_-tI3gHQ
Please god no
I'm betting it'd only touch 272 at most, 271 if you're lucky
yes
hahahah fuck all those baba fucks who were screaming in chat yesterday...made moe get 50 shares ah
Friday is going to feel like 9-10am all half day long.
Ur puts wouldnt be up bigly unless you bought them right at close and even then they still wouldnt be up that much
Oh for sure that's what some of it is. But it could cause a bit of a panic sell from weak traders who immediately jump to conclusions.
thas what i'm doing. gotta get that 5 piece pasta maker for the kitchenaid.
Dont disrespect my NIO like that...
lol 
The great Nio extinction
close call on those XPEV..
Gonna de-convert my spread by buying back the call I sold yesterday before close, and then let my naked call ride the wave up hopefully
Gonna de-convert my spread by buying back the call I sold yesterday before close, and then let my naked call ride the wave up hopefully
Looking at the big techs, no real bargains yet.
Pltr and thicc bee
Interesting spelling
EV talks going well -pooh bear
Grats
Are you my conscience?

Youll regret it next week
Right there with you bro... 8/27 too fml
rip son
calls or puts?
Same here lmao maximum guh
Yep. If I were to guess any stock likely to double in 2021. This would be it.
Anyone who bought the dips Monday and Tuesday getting paid today
Green for the Native Americans, very thoughtful of the MMs
"super discounted" AKA if you bought it ANY TIME on ANY DAY (minus yesterday) it would have been cheaper, lol
>calls

Have you held to expiration without being assigned? Usually your broker will close your position at end of day on expiration if you haven't closed/ exercised your option resulting in the loss regardless
...what?  Calls are almost never exercised until expiration day if that's what you're asking
Do it and thanks for your sacrifice
Probably next week but maybe hold some to be safe
Thats not how it works
Probably. I dont think retard strength has completely abandoned it yet
Ya got lucky
Already planning to, wish I hadnt bought the top yesterday tho lol
x 300 million
Thats every vaccine ever dude. Happy to feel like shit for two days so i can get on a cruise ship

So basically the flu but for one day
Sounds like it just gives you covid
over 100,000 people have already got it via trials... smh
It dropped from 366 to 355 last week wym lol
I did too.  Gonna pray for some news
It's called roll costs you 'tard.
BABA
Mostly. Profit taking right now. Maybe another hour before panic sets in or its back to business as usual
Not yet
After ATH?  Not on your life.
Sir, you mean a 10-15% morning?
right, I thought I was too late
Go up
They will be running the world soon
it blows are tiny minds
go up.
Serious question for me too. I read up on them and still couldnt figure it out. Maybe Im dumdum. All I could gather is data analysis for companies.
I did, hope it doesnt fall much lower...
Feb-March
Sometime mid Feb.
But more
yeah man. holding PLTR and AMC makes me sweats
Feb? mine expire in two days lmao
always
Up 8% in a week. But sure PLUG is dead.
PLUG has a lot left in the tank 
Hey, that exact same thing just happened to me! 
sell the $28s? locks in your profit and no PDT?

not sure have not had PDT for long time
Just sold for 200% profit and got marked ASAP 
it was over 26 for a hawt min bro
SQ. Credit Karma Tax acquisition announced 
Both but if I had to choose it's SQ. They have tendrils in everything.
Both
Credit Karma Tax acquisition announced 
BTFD? I did.....
Buy the dip bro
Drumpf is FiNiShEd
It's not unless you let it be done
Good call ur smart
Men do all the DDD jobs..  why is that never talked about?
SPACS have been crazy this year
Christ, a Subutex implant device? Where were going, we won't need buprenorphine!
Weak hands and dumping
Green EOD not even kidding
Stopppp talking
Sold my TSLA debit spreads this morning for 100% profit. I know TSLA only moons for a short while before it adjusts. Welcome to correction day
Should probably buy the dip right now
Of course.
I feel dumb for selling my puts earlier this morning. I didnt trust those pumps, but wanted to lock in profit
Not everything - Im still waiting on one stock to go down.
2.50p
To the basement. How that company's not bankrupt is anyone's guess.
Nah itll go back up. Bastards selling off to buy turkeys.
oof
I've BEEN stacking cheesies on retail homie
A lot of things are.
I can hear Bogdanoffs phone ringing
Idk but it's making me hard
That's the wise way. I'm holding for Friday too. Thats the wsb way.
Hmmmm options are relatively cheap. Ill buy a call or two see what happens
Already riding the wave 
No one knows, obviously they are overvalued based on current earnings but future potential has engaged retard strength so no telling where they will go.
Hmmm considering some are still up over 50%, Id say theres a chance of dump
[deleted]
You have to be new. SHOP is an OG meme stock

There was a guy on here with $1-2mm worth
They cant afford SHOP options
Too expensive
um, SHOP holders still in the red man. Speaking from experience.
What's TA?
WSB is the MM. rug pull whenever we sell AND WE AINT FUCKING SELLING
BUT I JUST GOT IN
Bought 56k worth of 306 30Cs expiring 02/21

Check post history, its now worth 160k lmao
Ive only got 27c 12/24. If I had more to spend Id buy leaps till next November
300 shares around 15 with covered calls expiring friday.
All my calls are in shares now.
12/4 25c
11/27 25C
Previously had 12/31 20c and 5/2021 25c which I sold for profits being a overly cautions paper hand bitch that I am.

Back in for 12/31 30c
Closed 2/19/21 15c purchased when PLTR was in low $14s today for a 300% gain and rolled yesterday into 1/15 26c
12/11 30c
it will close at 4pm ET

26.5
APHA
Get out of ACB. Go APHA for mid/long term
Use imgur you maniac
selling and buying back in isn't considered a day trade. Just buy them back plus the extra you wanted. Hope you didn't fuck yourself on the limit price.
downvoted for using a shady ass virus link
I have developed an irrational hatred for RIOT's refusal to move up a dollar.
12/31 30c and 1/21 30c. Want to get leaps but those premiums!!
30$ 1/15/21 calls
Honestly I'm fine with giving the bears a -5% spy day.
nice call
Thats exactly what I said before I lost 12k in a correction 
Selling your call is selling the contract. Excercising is buying 100 shares of palantir for $30 a piece EOW in it goes above $30
If you sell it, you get whatever its market value is. Maybe it's $2.00, so you get $200 right now and you profit $200 minus whatever you paid.

If you *exercise* it, then it disappears and you immediately *buy* 100 shares for whatever the strike price happens to be. So you gotta have the cash to do that in order to exercise it. Then you can either hold the stock or sell immediately. In that case your profit is (current stock price) - (strike price) - (whatever you paid for the call) * 100 shares.

You reallllllly shouldn't be trading options if you don't know this stuff. Please be careful and don't lose your shirt!
If you exercise it you have to have enough funds in your account to buy # contracts x 100 at the strike price. Otherwise you can sell it for most likely profit to another tardo
If you exercise it, you actually acquire the shares at the strike price but if you just sell it, you never really acquire said shares. Really the only scenario you would want to exercise is if there were some dividends involved that you wanted to take advantage of.
You can exercise by buying the 100 shares of whatever you have your call on.
probably not the place to be asking that...

&#x200B;

exercising Calls means you pay the strike to receive the shares. Selling the calls is just like trading...you win or lose based on what you paid for the option.
Bought in too at the ATH apparently 
[deleted]
Thanks
Are you doubting the papa?
CRSR $65c 12/18 asking for too much?
Gme, but shares are safer since it won't go to 0. Probally shares until earnings day, then dump the shares and get fd's
250, I go both ways
Shoulda bought pltr
Built Different 
TSLA is a whole different beast
Thats because TSLA is the best in class
Honestly the only reason the other EVs rallied was because TSLA rallied..
thats because all the other EVs are just sidepieces. The real deal is TSLA.
They also acquired Xilinx which could help
If it gets too far in the money the spread will be wide and you will get a shitty fill
What stock?
Just hold till expiration
Sell and buy a higher strike
PLTR? Is there a lot of open interest for it still? If not, I'd roll it forward to a more ATM call or exercise it if you have the capital
Wasnt a secret. Mentioned plenty of times, but I guess nobody believed in it.
That's a big sad case of FOMO you got there
Buy the dip you retard
How do we get in if its halted you retard
Are the details out yet? My LEAPS are happy!
too dangerous. I would wait
Im gonna buy a couple hundred STONKS. Fuck it
Thats my plan. I assuming big selloff EOD since thanksgiving and shorter trading day on Friday.
jesus, is the a subscribed shit?
I missed the news release was relaxing away from computer
its going to 100b by feb atleast
You should charge your phone
Whats the mf strike
Lmfao
No itll go up. You have a few weeks
Charge your phone
1 bagger
1 bagger
Definition could be argued but wide use is 2 bagger, since you have the one bag, you double it, now you have two, and your stock is a twobagger.
Theyve actually been selling spice
You are late
money has already been made. too late to the party bruh
Because no one was in it
That is because they use the ticker WORK.
Theyre slacking on it.

er....you got the tickers mixed up;  

CRM is looking to buy WORK
the other way round
Nice intel, thanks for letting us know after it's already up $7 today lol
Nah fuck that. You could buy em back and pltr drops next week and youll hate yourself. Happened to me on a smaller scale with rkt. Sell some puts and they either hit and you get assigned some shares or they dont and you get free money
exp date?
Why not?
It will likely rise next week too
not happening on this volume chief
I need it to drop .5% :(
Accelerating the worlds transition to sustainable transport and energy.

No
Yes wsb is jumping off the Chinese fraud bandwagon and into cia land

you're god damn right it is. you see the volume on this thing? 108 million! like 5x the volume on spy atm HAHAHAHA
Theres your dip
no dip. only buy. didn't you see Cramer?
News about a data mining tool they're creating to help with vaccine distribution.

Peter Thiel is also a  gawd that doesn't play by the rules.
Cuz its PLTR
Honestly theres a lot of positive upcoming catalysts but for today I have no fucking idea
Because memes
We forgot about that, its all about PLTR atm
EV tractors are the next big thing.

Tell a farmer he doesn't have to fuck with diesel again and see if his zipper doesn't bust off and hit you in the face.
can you explain
I dont
Crsr is about to buy me a house the way I loaded up on that shit
Crsr is also super memed out. It did dip today though so rebought some spreads.
FREETRADER is easy for beginners PLTR 
Freetrade is like the poor man's Robinhood (no options, not as many companies), Etoro is okay but its a bit gay with hidden fees all over the shop, Revolut similar
IBKR
TSLA? PLTR? ALL OF THEM?
Fubo
2021 itll correct from 250 to 230
this...this is the correction
They have no ability to hedge w spy/qqq calls like they did for tsla/aapl run. Interesting to see play out
LMAO fuck spy
Trne
WSB is in complete euphoria
Wrong, P/E has to be negative.
RIP
enlighten us
don't.
Psh once in a generation. More like 3 times a year
If you need the money, sell. If you dont need the money, let it ride man. You dont wanna be that guy who sold TSLA at $29
People talk on how much money this did on PLTR and then all the rest jump in a day later.
Thanksgiving is where we drink and eat potatoes. Sell before turkey dinner
Max was 35 yesterday. I don't know who comes up with the numbers.
In the morning
Till noon or something idk
Half day close at 1pm.
Sell, buy PLTR 30c 11/27
Lol i dare you to hold over the long weeknd
Pltr only
did u just say pump pltr got it
RKT is dead to me
This is a PLTR sub bro
yolo
Buy thicc b
I think CIIC peaked and it may never reach that price again. Another alternative is Longview, discount price right now. Its a blank check company like CIIC. If the bull run continues I think its gonna be in the $20s next week
Or it's the next PTON, SQ, ZM, etc
Really...PLTR is blowing through IV crush with these moves, if anything IV is too low, should be over 200%
You buy PLTR
Take profit
Notice I said WHEN.
Whats delta? a frat?
Who??
It won't


29.5 or 30, profit is profit.
You had me till sell pltr
Aint just us bud.  Look at the volume
Don't do it.
I wish I had enough cash to sell covered calls.
Easiest $58 ever.
Bold move 
RemindMe! 2 Days
Sorry, I just have to know how this ends, lmao
It is a good thing to do for people who are earning large here on pltr and ev shit, help some folks out
Fuck off
The sector is being investigated, has nothing to do with NIO being a scam...for now
Still no one is listening
Ya'll are crazy thinking one down premarket dismisses a month long 80%+ gain. Even APPL has pullbacks and corrections.
Its not though
Cries on WSB about premarket 
Ahh shitt that suckss, & Do it plz, youll get the biggest fomo youd ever experience if this rockets  at open.
man, that sucks!!
did you just lose your college fund?
Who let this guy in
It only goes up, thats what it does
I think its a money printing company
With all the DD posts that would be surprising, but youre probably right with all these fools
Shut the fuck up. It makes me money
Something with plants?
I know its a lord of the rings reference
No its main customer base is .gov. It may be this timelines skynet
I was worried when it blasted through 20.  Now I'm just enjoying the ride.
No. Digital surveillance and data monitoring grow every single day. Its almost all poorly managed. A company that can fill the niche to build organized databases and process raw intelligence is poised to dominate for decades.
Stop limit orders are your friend.
yes 
Thats not how this works, once we get rid of all the sellers well be at $100 in no time, cause everyone knows its dumb to sell PLTR
??
gay 
 
Fuck you buy calls
No it only goes up
I'm selling them.

It's illegal to pump and dump.  It will shut the sub down.
pump and dump
Spammed to extremes at the moment. No options.  I would guess, and it doesnt meet the assumed requirement of a particular level of market cap.
Its because its below 1 billion market cap, hence not allowed.

Yesterday ppl were pumping it on here. Low post accounts mentioning it every 15 mins or so.
Mods trying to stop us Tuscan Raiders from stealing all the tendies.
Is it?
You commented the same thing twice in q minute. You must be down bad.
No
An EV expert are you? Lol...
Shoo go away bear
Thank fuck I trusted the feeling in my testes

Bail on Friday when it hits 32.
I aint fuckin leaving
Bitch hands dont make no money

translation: I was too chicken to buy, sell so I can get back in cheaper
Are we looking at the same stock? Cuz the PLTR Im looking at is up 18%
Imagine being retarded
Same lmao. 160 to 400. Meh r/smallstreetbets
What do you mean???
Who would claim to be jobless? I've never claimed it.
Few thousand? You sound rich to me
And this is how I know were about to top
most people are negative. Dont let the sentiment on this sub fool you. It is a gamble
Let's say you make 15% a day. Take the amount of money you have and multiply it by 1.15.. keep pressing "=" and you'll get to your answer. 12 days and you'll be over 10k\*

\*you probably won't make 15% a day for 12 consecutive days
If you bought 23c yesterday you would have quadrupled today
I doubled in a week but that's slow compared to some guys here
I think in order to pull this off you also have to be comfortable with the fact that you could lose it all. High risk, high reward/loss
it can happen in minutes but you can lose it all just as fast
all in SPY 375C 11/27, potential upside is 10X your money
Starting going red around the time of Europe markets opening. So the answer would be Europoors.
CHINA is the biggest hoax
This is just... wrong.
How about Nio and Xpev dips
Popping? This bubble just started, bruh.
Drilling? Its still above yesterdays low lol
never bet against meme stocks retard
Theres a butt ton of support where its at rn
Why are you worried about buying pltr at 17, that's going to be a steal
Are you kidding?  It's hardly even gone down lol
PLTR 
Sir, strike and expiration
So the merger went through?
Like shave pubes and make a pube milkshake mad

Sell. Take profit
Hold duh. It will continue to go up because all Chinese EV stonks are dead
What broker do you use
Pltrcoin
Ive stopped playing this try to time the ups and downs game with puts. You win big and then you lose it all back.

Buy the dip
Yeah it went back down to where it was... 2 days ago.
Going back to where it was a couple days ago and it's a shit stock? Lol.
Good job retard

Look at VIX and tell me that with a straight face!
Man. Those are some consistent gains
u take that back right now  
The market could be closed everyday if you just dont log into your brokerage account.
Na
How many shares do you have?
I believe we will know by mid December.  
It seems really possible to happen and if does it will moon.
69%
good to real good
PTLR isnt going down for a while
Obviously not bro
Buy volume needs to slow down first.
i fukken dare you.
Bro just buy the fucking calls and worry about it later.
An option is a gamble that 100 shares worth of a stock will reach a certain price. Puts mean you think itll go down and a call means u think itll go up.
just watch an intro to options video on youtube, take some notes, take more notes, then make some bread
the $30c for 12/31 is $630 btw
Pretty much
Just hit send order, dont worry about it too much.
I'm more bear than most and I say this is a very bad idea.  Don't touch meme stocks with bear hands until the attention is off of it.
Hows it feel to lose?
Is your dick a pussy?
Wow another 5:1 split before NYE?
You think they'll do a 3 for 1 stock split?
I hope it rains, so your paper hands get all soggy...
I know London's bearish a.f. atm, but this will likely hit big US names as well.

Lmfao why?
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
silly bitch
-90% lmfao are you retarded
Youre only going to get downvoted because youre wrong.
Downvoted because saying "-90%" is as retarded as "PLTR 35 EOW"
Id still be in the green if it fell 90. Try me
God just shut up
Don't trade options
Yes, that is how it works.
Yes
Bigly
Its a meme stonk which happens to be a good company, never leaving
Why do you hate money?
Buy the dip pm it will recover.
You wish. I wish. We all wish.
Holy damn, you used my word of the month Fatwa! I am a Bull Fedayeen Saddam for ever!

Nothing more American than getting filthy rich
Well I was born in Gyna though before moving here
Amen
Investing in NKLA might be better suited for you then.
These babies don't want to hear a harsh reality even though we're just trying to save them money
Nah, PLTR actually does things, unlike RKT
I sold my calls in prep for the thanksgiving fall off...regretting it currently
Lol you wish. Its not too late to buy in, dork.
Yes
What are you guys talking about? Tsla is up a few bucks from close and everyone is freaking out?
Waste of time. The window of infection, along with the time it takes for realization to do anything, is too vague and broad. If you have it, youve already infected others.
it's going to build support around 540-550 and then hit 600+ on inclusion

Oh really?
Whats your favorite?
Like?
I thought the same Monday....
ICLN is a great one to keep adding. CSIQ too
FuckICLN
QCLN is also great options as it's more diverse in its holdings with NIO and TSLA.
seriously guh
They literally powered Olympic buses with their batteries. They're a legitimate company making money. Not going to speculate one way or another on THiCc Bitch but they're not some sketch company.
Look up INAQ . Another SPAC play with notable investors
Go look at a ticker & see for yourself!  Lol.

No cum back please you're the best
Fiskers don't make any noise when they start, just to let you know.

gtfo that shit is wack
Gtfo
Isnt Biden against weed?
ICLN definitely the eco etf play - been so considering APHA for weed
No
China backs NIO if anything these regulations will help them and thin out competitors
Its limited to two EVs - one an OTC play.  Overreaction in my opinion. Im buying.
Idk man, those are some strong convictions you have
SAD.

PLTR STOPS FUCKING WHEN LOTD THIEL SAYS SO
Theres was a dip this morning and I bought another 50 shares at $25. Shouldve bought more.
We fucking told you the next dip is 28 and we were ignored, for those who were hesitant at 25
This is the way
Traditional car makers fumbled the fuuuck out of EVs.

Ford named this the mustang, Toyota basically threw away its Prius brand name that could have been leveraged for an amazing EV line of cars, Chevy had a dinky attempt at their first few hybrids

They left the market wiiiide open for Tesla to walk right in and start taking over.
I rather get an actual mustang. Those 5.0 autos are no joke. Rode in a buddies modded one and it does quarter miles in the 8's and spins at 100 on drag slicks. Things bonkers.
Fck are you like 80? Yeah Ford is cool and will make electric cars but it will never have the BDE of TSLA
Shoulda called it the Colt
Big 3 are playing catch-up from years of ignoring the EV market. IMO most likely the good small EV makers will either be bought out or will turn into suppliers for the big boys. Either way they win.
? Theres only 1 million flights booked this thanksgiving compared to the normal 80 million. But sure, keep taking out of your ass Europoor.
Alright covid police, relax. Ill take my PLTR stock with a side of sniffles any-day
In gains, yes
Its literally a blank check company. Walk Street doesnt care if its weed $ or blood money or a company thats destroying the planet or watching every last one of us to see what were up to. Just hand over the $.
Its a spac dude ticker will change after they merge
Yeah I was thinking the same thing
Algos dont give a shit about WSB. They do look at retail trades though
Its 5% down after 30% increase in two days, calm down 
More like  shaped
fifty dollars to one million is a lot my man congrats
Same
50 to 1000...k proof or ban
Why?
Get out
Yeah I ships off sold out the other day when it was up

Why?
It always pumps then drops, look at its price history

VXX $18 Calls expiring 12/4
Slowly buy end of dec TSLA calls over today.
If PLTR goes below 25, that's your move.
PLTR is at the bottom right now, around 25, buy calls for Jan or something like that, around 30-35c
ICLN
Price?
Its because of us <3
U didnt hear? They make ps5
why not lol
Big cocks bro thats why
Just like that...you know how it ends...
Someone's salty

wow mr Bear here.
I think the algos have become sentient and are now downvoting everyone.
CRSR is one I don't get as a meme play.  They make nice stuff, but what is the growth story?
Pinterest bro !! DO PINTEREST ! i own 720 at 15$ average
NET
>CRSR
Its down 3% after a 140% run up lmao
We arent quiet we busy buying the dip
it went all-time high yesterday post-market. It's paper hands selling and profit-taking over thanksgiving. I'm in shares so not worried at all.
<$20 by EoD
Friday doom moved to Wednesday in observance of thanksgiving.
No buy the dip wtf
It's a dip, this thing could easily double within a year
It was inevitable, PnDs don't last too long
My read is buy the dip today out to 12/18 or 1/15 but not as far as February (because PLTR employee-holders can sell shares in February and there may be another dip).
12/31 30cs load em up
This is not the way

My pp don't work
Nice try SEC
PLTR IS COMING OUT WITH A NEW BIKE THAT ACTUALLY MOVES WHEN YOU PEDAL

*looks at old graph*                                                     why didnt u just buy here and sell there? Idiot 
not everyone can buy at premarket fuck boy
sell it before expiration. If you dont have enough in your account I think most brokers sell it automatically before market close at 4
End of trading day Friday so 12:00pm EST this Friday cause of the Holiday.
It expires at close on 11/27. Robinhood is gonna sell it automatically tho if its in the green before close. Markets open Friday. If youre green today just sell it.
Sell it. No one on this sub actually exercises their options nor do you have the funds to do so.
Youll either have to sell or exercise if youre ITM.  I recommend reading on options while your practicing.  Dont forget to actually invest in stocks.  Your portfolio should be 8-10% options, of course everyone here yolos so whatevs.
Sell the contract before you hurt yourself and go read up on how options work.
Ban. Go watch some YouTube videos
Man youre a retard. 

If youre in robinhood it will try to exercise or close out the option one hour before close on the expiration day. 

Just because it passed the strike doesnt mean youre past your break even #. 

Stock market is closed on Thanksgiving fgt.
correct. unless you have enough cash to cover the exercise and want to hold long-term, you're better off selling the contract well before the expiration (ie. don't wait until 3:30 on 11/27). it'll be easier to sell if it's ITM but it's still not guaranteed that anyone wants to buy it

it expires at the closing bell on 11/27.
Pussy. I hope to drink the tears you have when you wake up tomorrow and PLTR hits another ATH. Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives.
Never herb
I found Kramers account
If you think pltr will crash you are actually retarded

Mooning by lunch - the markets have realized the CRSR is amazing and are arranging a stratospheric propulsion that will start shortly after open.

A correction is due. I'm personally out of all leaps until one happens. I'm guessing within the next 2 weeks.
This has become a P&D channel, truly.
That's what I thought, but just a tiny hint of vaccine news and this thing is gonna blow past $21, and DEC 12 is the deadline for approved emergency use, so it won't fall till after Dec 12

Most likely gonna bounce back

having margin turned on will fuck you if you drop below $2000. If theres no chance of that it is only useful if buying stonk not options
Think of how retarded you must be to not know that funds will front run the inclusion so they are not buying at the peak.

FUCK THAT SHIT
I sold all my SPCE if thats any consolation. How do u feel about thiccy B
Where do you make plays on VIX. I dont see the ticker on td
How do you do that? Simple terms that a regraded could understand .
I thought this but didn't act on it because it is going into a holiday.  I feel like volume will be lower than normal in power hour.  Most indicators are showing sentiment is still pretty bullish, too.  I say this while my sentiment is the opposite.  But I decided not to fight the market on this one and might be able to get a premium priced VIX call on Friday?
Wasnt that yesterday?
what proof do you have
Good strat, make them lower the price of calls !
pltr did that in like 4 days

This is so retarded that..nvm
I know this is sarcasm, but it feels like something a real magatard would say.

Mods. Please remove this man.
SPY is for boomers
better yet hedge your positions with futures with micro contracts and selective puts like bank stocks it is easy to protect downside this way.  The market is nuts but you still want to make money on the upside.
8 minute until green open and this entire sub mood swings into raining money like yesterday.

Bruh, PLTR isn't dropping below $20. There's a fucking HUGE buy wall. IF it does, I'll be joining you buying more shares.
Sorry these numbers are unrealistic, youre about to get left in the dust if you dont hop on now.
lmao, why troll?
Yeah definitrly wait until its like 16. 
Lol nice
We don't run anything, let alone "microcap" penny stocks
They are doing a share offering. That shit is gonna dump to $2.

No
What are you talking about? Pltr is up. Green day

I mean, is NVDA a mining company? Because that bish be drilling
No.  Its 2 no name companies
Not unless you invested into shady companies. If you have NIO you'll be fine.
Nope. Good for companies like nio xpev & Li
No they are investigating two companies not even traded on the U.S stock market for trying to enter the ev sector for government subsidies
Lol accurate sentiment

TSLA if it holds a support throughout the day. if theres no floor, get out of it
By definition yes, thats pullback

Tmr is Thanksgiving, they are closed. Friday will be open until 1.
Yes
No, closed tomorrow. Open til 1pm Friday
As soon as people are back from the Thanksgiving holidays. This is just general sell off before the holidays.
Why
you expect it to drop over 20%? Thats retarded.
Check nio and xpeng. Some shit going on
looking good so far, building energy to break out of downtrend from october
Think it will go up by Friday
Or maybe there is a reason nobody wants to buy puts right now
Just burn the money instead at least you'll get some warmth
you misspelt 570
Nah
Probably never. Try getting a REALLLLL brokerage.
What a weird take
We dumping?
apha surging
Amazon is gunna blow up when you can order a 20 bag online and get prime shipping 
Think itll pull back with the news? 12/11 34p are .95. Seems safe but this market idk.
How retard can you be? Go short some EV stocks
After the run 
Still 3h left for gainz. Power hour will be epic.
NO BUY BRO
Not at all
Bro GET IN. STOP Asking. But yesterday, today, tomorrow, next week, next month. GET IN!
On day of expiry all options will track very closely to their intrinsic value.
I think delta increases closer to 1 for ITM options as it gets close to expiration so cements your intrinsic value
Market is closed tomrorow, retard.
Obviously that is THE golden question on the stock market right now. Answer right and collect millions.
$60 EOY. $100 next year

lets gooooo. nearly sold yesterday too
>APPN 

first I've heard of this. why appn?

So 2 dollar increase in 7-8 months?  That doesn't sound like a WSB play at all. Go post that shit to another subreddit
The downvotes 
$7 by june? Palantir will triple by then lmao
No
Maybe it crashes for the same reasons the market does but i dont think the crashing of one causes the other to crash
If by the end you mean the new bottom.
Yea its only up 7% rn
yeah this is the END of palantir
PLTR 60 tomorrow!
Stfu
Ban
It's mostly due to real estate values. They just paid off their house and it doubled in price. Easy math.
[deleted]
Fuck off to r/investing
where is the dump? everyones buying this shit
You dont know what a pump and dump is retard. This is a 44BN market cap stock

Market is closed tomorrow retard.
They sell stonks that go up
Lol if you cant be fucked to google a single article about the company then you deserve to lose out on the tendies. God speed, idiot.

Tomorrow the market is closed.
This guy just said thank god the free money ended what an asshole
Boo

Doubt it

That ticker doesnt exist

Sorry my grandma has been dead for 2 years now
Next year
Very wrong
Weak genes
Sheesh...
No
HOLD
You bafoon.. you know damn well you shouldnt
Maybe in December if you are scared of the employee lockup sell off.
Hold for at least 1000 percent. Or sell now and try to time a dip to get back in
No
is it itm? sell and get a higher strike maybe, lock some gainz in
Depends on your expiration homie.
Shares? Fcuking HOLD LOL
Ban 


this dude for spam already I've seen like at least 10 comments of this in the past 5min
Youve been saying this daily for how long now

Just because you keep writing that every 2 mins doesn't make it true
So calls at open
If it drops by 10 putting 100k into shares.  

Pissed I missed it at $10
You fucking new? Cases havent meant shit for months
Huh
Takes 1 click to get cash bro
100k cases doesnt mean shit when 99,996 of those people are going to live and get on with their lives.
This guy have puts
Gay
*Be silent, keep your forked tongue behind your teeth!*
Ban
Username checks out
Yeah no... not with markets closed for essentially 4 days straight
Puts?
They like to play tradezies
Pretty sure LOGi is the old CRSR
Logi has 3x the market cap of Corsair. It's the opposite.

Well thats too bad
I don't think anyone's crying
Fuck you

Edit: if youre not trolling, yes
It does go up every day. Every day until it gets officially listed on the SP 500, then itll go higher
Fisker is legitimately garbage dude
Tissue paper hands smh
More like Nordcummm

Are we reading the same thread?
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man
Its not a hype train its real
Oh its just getting started
Its just getting started. We havent even hit full send around here. I see 1 yolo PLTR post
Thats what we said at 20, and 25
Heard it here first
You really declaring victory this early in premarket after the last few days haha?
Chill boy, it's 1 day, and the markets aren't even open. With the opportunity cost of the last 2 weeks, you're still wrong.
Oh no, a red day after a month of insane gains.
You think this is the top? Lol theres so much more space for tendies
Lol started holding calls when it was at $20 and theyre ripping now
is that you jordan
Go away
sell higher than u bought
buy a cheap one, learn by doing. Buy an FCEL call and a F call
Watch a tik tok video on it, thats what all the best advisors are saying
Lol Facebook call
What the hell is your issue... did your wife leave you for  boyfriend finally...

 I'm that witch and proud. And what the fuck does posts and comments from other subs have to do with what I post here... seriously get a life and DD into stocks not me. Weirdo.
Selling tickets to the rocket launch, baby.

Run far away
Go fuck yourself
Tech
Turn around 360 degrees and walk away
Fuck off back to r/stocks and ask there.  
This isnt a place for teaching.  
This is a place for degenerate gambling.
I just sold all my FSR yesterday thinking this motherfucker didnt have enough memes or talk on here. Whats your price target for it? I rebought today hoping itll be the next thing pumped here

Open brokerage. Buy PLTR.  DM me if you're new to investing and ill send you the link for webull and robinhood free stocks

Before the stock split.
Not at all. Buy some shares. Thank us later.

No rockets. Ban.

I've sold the CC for F twice in the last month.

When I don't have a cc expiring, it inches along. As soon as I sell the CC, it explodes up.
I'd stay away from penny stocks like F
Nobody tell this guy
I was also told that everyone here is a millionaire
r/woooosh

Can't argue with that
Agree. So confuse! Just tell me where to stick the dildo....
I want to cum 

Like all the days since early November basically..
Pre-market is susceptible to volatile price action. Volume is a speck compared to regular trading hours.
Oh, gai*n* porn.

Im holding 1/15 $20. Should we sell mate? Take profits?
How does it feel now?

THISSS
Lower operating costs. Bullish.
Even bigger bull run
We can wipe each others tears
Retard, do u not see I'm a clown?
12/31?
Honestly, loved it.  Probably the best years of my life. Fortunately graduated before the whole covid thing hit.
Lmao not wrong
Except he said that were treating it like play money hahah
Uhhh. Might have.
$100k is a fuck ton. Personally would not put more than 20% of my portfolio in this thing. There are plenty of other things Id like to dump money into as well like AMZN and SPY (once it eventually dips). AAPL as well if it goes below 110ish. 

Buy the dips and build over time and youll be solid imo. 

NIO is the most solid CHYNA EV of them all from what Ive looked into.
Sell calls every week on that dude. 20 contracts a week at a buck a piece is good coin
someone mistyped 54.1
I'd wait until Friday personally. We haven't had a green friday in a really long time.
He must speak from experience, wouldnt take his advice
they're gonna do that anyhow, may as well get paid for it
Literally
Welcome to my lawn.
So does that mean TSLA price drops?
We thought this right after inclusion and it didnt do shit
Fuck is everyone doing? I fomod at 18
Imagine not buying microsoft in 1998 and also telling people not to invest

I've got a 7k buy order on deck also.
Its the last dip you will ever see.
I wish
Okay
Probably just a bot.
Now i'm no linguist, but a penny stock should be something that trade for less than 1$ per action. According to investopedia definiton the bar rises to 5$, still THC-B never went under 9.50, so wtf are those mods about?
Thats not a penny stock.
kinda dumb. Very good and accurate DD was given about public filings on an open internet forum. Just because the company its about has a low market cap shouldn't mean we aren't allowed to discuss it.
Already have
They will run the world one day, they are NSA on crack.
nobody knows
they are good at data and computers and stuff, shut up and buy it.
They be catching yo terrorists. S like batman but an application. Called gotham. Puts on kellogs. Sexual intercourse. Calls on paper clips. Fuck all of you.
Imagine Skynet but with unstructured and structured data, it's analysis, integration, then presentation for making decisions.
Look for yourself
Okay bear boi.
So am I but I'm not Retarded
Literally wait til EOD to be perfectly safe buy an FD and fucking profit. I thought it was too late to get in when I got in on Monday. I'm up over 300%
We dont pay her that much, she lied to you
Lol, I'm mostly just trying to gain a bit more. I'm already in from around 18-19~ or so, just closed some calls around the top today so trying to get a dip to buy some new ones and roll out.
40 by end of December at the latest
Hey man, that's not cool to joke about. I'm nearly 30 and make $13.5/hr, but I've recently finished a degree and am trying to keep my head up. Don't rob yourself of a chance at life, especially so young.
Your right it could drop to 45 before rebounding
You serious? Fuk.
What price will that dip get bought up?
Time for new car ?
Duuuuuude congrats, huge dub!
Youre not worried that the meme juice will run out and itll crash?
How many % are you up on those calls?
Where are the sellers!!!!!!!
So sad to see the way his last chapter went, but the rest of it was beyond epic. Diego Maradona was a man who truly lived life and was able to enjoy it. God speed to him for it, not many can say that.
Not if you want it to keep going up
crazy
 roger
It still is
This is the way. Guaranteed tendies.
Is Cramer fearful or optimistic today?
He deleted his comment babe lmao, judging by Dan in Kuwait's comment below me I assume it had something with underwear? thongs? Lol
Hes such a scumbag. I see people call him out on Twitter and he brings up moves he made a decade ago. Hey did you buy Apple? What about Facebook in 2013? Wow jim too bad I cant go back several years. Still riding calls he made all those years ago when weve been in a long running bull market. Idk anyone in any field that measures present performance with their past performance.

Rolling his sleeves up... and sweating.
Told people to sell yesterday
Nice problem to have, cant get any to fall through because its growing so fast right now. Fuck
Would you care to explain to a noob? 
Do you have to 'close' those calls? 
What happens when it goes above $29? How does having the monthly $25 calls help you?
Thanks so much!
If you have any resources, that would be appreciated. Cheers!
Losing free money is my specialty.
Enjoy your tendies 
Im a gen z with a crippling gambling addiction give me a break
It's ok. I did it too. But F theta burn this week.
Its $30 EOW.
Whats the catalyst to pull the rugs? You need a catalyst, and we aint got one.
For real though. I have zero regrets.
Or, I can grow a pair of nuts and an extra chromosome and hold like the degenerate retard I am
Just sold everything and repositioned into 32C 12/4, Im ready
Mods gay saying it too small market cap but meanwhile GM literally the same thing
Yeah I heard he killed a lot of retirements for boomers. Boomers still love him.
I didnt say I followed any of his moves you fucking mongoloid no reading comprehension skills looking assssss
Congrats 
If your expiration isnt  Friday then 
Preach.
Im only messing around .. cash gang 
AirBNB deepening its moat buy offering shares in the private market to their superhosts before IPO. Huge dick move in every aspect. Not buying any other IPOs this year.
Im that guy rn lol
when you do that, you automatically lock in ~30% of your gains going to taxes, you would need a huge price drop to make up for that.

Thanks man!
Thanks bro! Its been fun but crazy, this shit is wild af lol
Haha same here. Of course Im a degenerate and have been doubling down. Calls were damn cheap this morning.
Good points. Let me rephrase. We should be on the lookout for the next stock that has great potential like PLTR (Roblox baby) and simply let others know via WSB because we are all retarded and should lookout for our fellow idiots.
Knowing how mad he is watching this brings an inordinate amount of joy to my life
It's like they split aces and hit aces and split them again!
Got a full sleeve already so no need to worry, and honestly would love to add one more as a homage to all retards here
If it didn't do the same thing every time they wouldn't call it a pattern!
As in its actually not a pump and dump. Its gonna be Tesla level amazing for years to come. Youre set
What did he say?
So when we can trade futures well have total control?
More like the algos are tricking us into buying it

Oh, and /s
Palantir all the way bro, dumping Apple and Disney and YOLO life ahead
Actually there's a chance this could take off lol. Considering the number of professionals in WSB. Ticker will be MEME of course, and it's probably gonna be the best performing ETF ever.
Basically we look at this like a video game. And we are all up early. Which supposed them haha

They see lines go up and think they are winning stuck out to me

I bought in at low low. I'm good unlike ev bitch boys.
WTF is this euphoria. Honestly does this stock even have a valuation? The only other stock I've seen go like this is TSLA.
Ok to Valhalla we go.
I would have 100K profit in just 5 calls if that happened. I'd be extremely OK with it lol, and I think you might be underselling it tbh. I think 300
I like it now lets meme it into existence.
[I put my money where mouth is, unlike 90% of retards here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jtbqwt/crsr_corsair_40c_may_21_2021_exp/gdhan5b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)
True. I actually revolved my calls into better strikes. Lets see if it puts off cotton.
Crsr baby
Made me lol
gain. but in march I was down 48k. so theres that
lol nah no Target. yeah it's always nice to see a milestone. I'm ready for a big pullback but 100 would certainly be cool to see.
pretty much all shares from march, and I revenge traded some stonks I bought jsut before the pandemic.
I havent ever jinxed a ticker before. Hopefully that doesnt change this time or am ded.
Its just Day 1 dawg. Whatd I tell you.
Lmao. I made decent amount with shares. Just dabbling in options now.

A meme ( MEEM) is an idea, behavior, or style that becomes a fad and spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme.

I dont even know what a stop loss is I brought back into CRSR it went up a lil started dipping again straight after, but I dont have the patience plus the PLTR tendie train? Too good to miss out on
Bro its bullshit. I work 9 hours (we have the 9/80 schedule) and Im a fucking electrical engineer. I work most of that obviously, but so much is waiting on other people or dumbass meetings.
Had 24c 12/4. Got 30c 12/18

Have CCS 29/33 12/4 now too
Still got mad momentum, but I dont think it powers too far in $30 before next week.
Agree, this is absurd. And I love it.
that's a good point lol..
this lol
I told myself if i did it once i could do it again and quit being a little bitch and trusted my gut
Shitty used one until I start having kids.
They obviously don't have enough PLTR
Why can't we, by which I mean someone else here, do it?
yes motherfucker!!!
More like 2 months lol
No no no the puppy was like industry. In that, they were both lost in the woods. And nobody, especially the little boy - "society" - knew where to find 'em. Except that the puppy was a dog. But the industry, my friends, that was a revolution.
I read that like the therapist from Rick and Morty
Yeah I know.. I was being sarcastic

Yup I wouldn't even consider buying anything shorter than 6 months out

Ah yeah! Nice catch!
JMIA last week and PLTR this week! I feel blessed to be part of this beautiful community of autists.
Fuck you too 
Where are all the sellers????
I held FSR for 2 months through its drop and rise. Dont know if can risk getting burned by it again
55%
Stick with it! In time you wont even like sugar anymore
Bruh, similar event. My sister developed diabetes. My family history shows that only the women develop it but Im not willing to run that gamble anymore. Good changes but the cravings have staying power.
I dont keep track of that. I should but not for now.
Nah, I dont get into fads. However, I do have a healthy amount of nuts in my diet.
Nice and slow. I started with no honey in my sugar and then escalated. I dont even want to imagine cold turkey.
Mostly berries like 1lb of strawberries and 8oz of raspberries or blackberries. Organic because they taste better but they last only 2 days after purchase day since they have a short shelf life. After that, dark chocolate or nothing.
Nah positive vibes only. I got PLTR 12/11 30c in my portfolio :)
Make more
PUMP PUMP PUMP
Good luck friend!
Thats what I was thinking
Thats what Im probably gonna do. Cash in EOD roll out 2 weeks strike of 30

Lol what the fuck
I might lose some but PLTR is so hot rn Im willing to risk some more on it
those are options i bought. I just sold my $22 call exp. 11/27s and decided to jump back in in by some $30 call exp. 11/27
So my 12/24 30c will print, and then I'm out for good?
Fuck it Ill run naked through these streets too. Mamma didnt raise no bitch.
$10 and I still want to fomo in more. Didnt put in enough due to all the retarded allegations of immorality, just wanted to dip my toe but glad I did
True, but the fomo is real
Bought some more PSTH

Thankyou. Dealing with a mama Mia 3 possible fathers thing with my side bitch so I dont even know if I should feel anything about the divorce but sadly I do.
Im not sobbing... I really needed that. This is hard to deal with
I got her to have a summer job at fucking taco Johns and then she fucked her manager. I slept on the floor in the second bedroom and had to hear them fuck in my bed. I shouldve went in and killed them but I didnt. Know I live with this reality. Its not funny or easy. It means drinking to forget till I die.
I had at 10,sold, had at 15, sold at 20, jumped back in at 23, now prob securing profits again lol. Idk. I just want the realized gains

Tbh, I hate to be a bear but based on the investor sentiments and latest news about India, no. I hope I'm wrong.
I dont do FDs. 540c 1/15/21
I did! Sold a bunch of 11/27 25C contracts. Secured profits and then rolled the rest into more.
It was at its all time high yesterday too. Even higher today
Options chains don't even go up that high currently.
this is looking like it's gonna get even more violent to me
Pls no, let the shorties bleed
The rest of my money is in PLTR..we need you do it bro
Any of them. Im playing next week calls.

Still has retard meme strength
Yes, this
i bought two of them and sold one when it was up 50%
Fucking champ
At the rate its going as soon as youd like and I think youll take profit. Im sitting on 20c for Friday and Im rock hard watching this baby climb

75% institutional ownership, does streaming advertisment and partnership with HULU, books are profitable, lockdown + Holidays= streaming like no tomorrow. Biggest one though is hedgefunds and institutes are adding to ETF and they ride the market. So its almost a no brainer to hop in, as it has NO real reason next month not to stop increasing in value.
A bunch of dudes that can either control market movement or have insider or info of which way something is going to getting 10,000% returns is very complex.
To be completely honest. If you dont know the answer to this question/arent confident enough to make the play right now. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, open a TD Ameritrade account, and trade with fake money paper account. I lost thousands learning how to do what little I know how to do.
I used my gains for shares
Just compare balance sheets lll
This might be the greatest bubble of all time or a revolution in how we look at the stock market
Robinhood democratized those fucking tendies
I mean...I usually do. More fun this way though 
Definitely not gay...
Wow does that mean you made money?! Lol
Im not complaining. If you told me this a year ago I would of laughed
Thats a given
Haha hello twin hows your day going
Can you read the future? No? Fuck off PALANTIR 30 EOD
OK :)
More than a few she got a fat ass
yea, the stonks. not options. hope im not fucking myself over w this
Then you should sell an $18 put at open.
lol Good luck with that. How gay can someone be to believe PLTR can drop 25%
This dude is salty af. Made bad plays and is now spreading FUD lol
Goodluck 
Have you looked at the spreads this morning?

Tastytrade bro
IBKR
Tastytrade or IBKR bro
Seems like we're both having a pleasant ride to Mars
Dont get my wrong, i have a bunch of stonks and bullish options. Im just holding to 40% of my account in cash that I took from profits of a call that I cashed out 2 weeks ago and I just cant bring myself to buy anything
So once they find nothing = moon?
Not true
But, it's not though. They're looking into Evergrande and Shenzhen Baoneng.
Most of it is already profit I should be able to get out green if it opens flat because most are ITM
Most are ITM so might be able to get out with profit still for the week if it opens flat
Sure meth is great, but have you ever tried yoloing your entire savings into NKLA calls?
Id do some meth if I knew where to get it.
HAH ok 
Even if all they want is your money.
im holding calls from yesterday and gonna be down at open :(
Strike & exp?
Hope they aren't weeklies
Oh I bought then too, but today's payday so more cash flow = more shares.
That's it I'm doubling down.
They are also based in a country with 1T plus people that OVERTLY prioritizes home grown companies + a hard move to reduce emissions. Bonus point: its run by Winnie the Pooh and he tells everyone what to do so compliance isnt really optional.
Its only $2 k bruh
Ill ask, but they probably charge massive premium for that. I just ordered an American eagle
To me: TSLA (barely dipped), NIO, and LI. In my eyes: everything else ran unjustly because of these 3.
TSLA
His diet consists of mostly weeklies, the high intake of Theta is like eating empty calories.
555 here lol
Im holding 12/31 25C    12/24  27C    and 3/19  25C

Don't ask how I picked those strikes
Selling covered calls when it does. Theta gang. This is the way
I said I didnt k ow what I was doing lol
Your mom literally is selling PLTR
Theta gang annihilation time
Bruh I literally sold all other tickets thats not PLTR in my account. We going all in 
Yeah I feel like a dumbass not doing that in handset. 

Greed is evil
Yeh Im going to pick up shares and wait for IV to come back to earth
Shares or calls
my -75% point was shortly after i broke even from down 65% on some puts, then failed to capitalize

learned my lesson here. my shit is way less flammable now. long calls are way more up my alley
I bought in PLTR at IPO day 1, held 1000 shares, sold calls and bought 2021 17.50 and $20 jans, feb 2021 $17.50 and $20 and Jan 2022 $20. Sold all when it hit $21ish. Then just bought $25s, $500 shares, and $30s for feb 2021. Its been crazy
I usually wait for a pullback and proper entry but decided fuck it, if I'm buying calls for March it doesn't matter what happens today when it'll hit my strike by next week lmao
Yeah I've been in since $10 and I've been waiting for a re-buy opportunity today that hasn't come
What an amazing stonk
Nice one mate, fucking wish I had came across this sub then lol
bought at $10
I had to stop myself from selling earlier because I thought I was on borrowed time, but I got lucky holding out. I'm thinking it'll come down in the coming weeks once the hype is over... But who knows. Gotta lock in those gains at some point
Might not, but I'm going to watch it for a good entry point if not $19. I think $15 is the highest analyst price. But, I'm happy with my gains for a month
$30c 1/31/22 and $30c 12/4/20 to ride this current momentum.
I was waiting for funds to clear last week and missed some gains before I was finally able to buy. Staggered my buys which mostly resulted in upping my cost average but Im still up 40% regardless and will be adding as time goes on.
Those are going to make you filthy rich. Congrats man dont forget to throw some $$$ toward charity.
Sold 5 minutes ago lol but Im thinking about going in again
Yes..
holy fuck
lmao thank you
No thanks
execute sounds cool
I have 500 shares already. Im trying to move money else where. Im in on Tesla PLTR and SQ.  Need something else
On PLTR?
So calls or more shares?
Getting there this week!
i guess. this position was already a 10 bagger.
Thats exactly what Im saying you beauty
14 million dollar hedge. I love that sort of hedge with over 160,000 contracts O/I.
1/15/2021
I have 200 $6 contracts for March.  I then have another 9000 in shares with an average cost of 3.31. I have about 50 other calls for various ranges but those are the largest two.
This is the way
For real someone kept saying get in a month ago at 4.xx and I'm so glad I hopped in
Consolidate 27-27.50 then run next week. It's option expiration of a short week into low volume Friday. I would love to be proved wrong
holy fuck
Love that. The new panameras really are the tits congrats
Ive got 12/18 50c think thats enough time?
been there...done that
Think so , couldn't recognize him with the clown make up on
Im (Clapping Emoji) too (Clapping Emoji) Greedy (Clapping Emoji) and dumb (Clapping Emoji)
oh im in big time
Facts
yes, I am a retard but I want to be an autist
It kinda looks like it already boomed tho. I seriously think we need to experiment with a dead stock similar to HTZ and see how much we can pump it
dont ever sell. I work for the govt and use PLTR for work. They almost always resign contracts.
ya but it will never be like that again, kids stuck at home robloxing their lives away
Dude i hope. Ill make 5k
0 day trades left after the last two PLTR trades I did today... paper hands has left me with only 1k profit on the day
I would like the trade my PS5 for some PLTR calls.
It over a year's
 Lost 3k today. Whatever
Well I have to buy a boat at some point...
Good shit brother. Ive gotta learn how to take profit again so Ive got a strict 20% gain limit rn
Top 5 worst feelings of my life SO FAR. 

Had all my money tied up to it too, but didnt wanna make the same mistake Id made before so sold for profit. Im fucking stupid
Flip a coin 10 times. It lands on heads every time. Flip it again. Whats the probability that itll land on heads? 50% u autist
Disclaimer: here for genuine discussion 

Could that not just be the world rotating out of established brands? Apple is still a 2T company, Amazon is still making Bezos shit $100 bills. Were just moving quickly away from traditional automotive into new companies who are leaner and faster. Thats how these established automotive brands started out right, makes sense we come full circle? I mean I dont deny that some of these EV companies have stupid valuations but weve got to be moving away from traditional auto to EVs and the companies that have proven EVs like TSLA are going to dominate our landscape
Agreed
100%
Lmao
At least Im up 30k+ on the same over the last week so overall Ill still have something haha
Right? Lmao
Only in for 3 contracts at 17 and 50 shares at 17.. pleb money but still haha
You're spot on. This is also true with degrees like computer science, which is a theoretical field and so the focus isn't on programming. 

Source: I studied computer science for my undergraduate degree.
As someone who has previously worked in welding, people who think knowing how to weld will guarantee you a high paying job obviously arent welders. There are plenty of welders making shit for money. The average salary for a welder is like $40k because for every person making 6 figures there are a whole lot of welders making less than $20 an hour.

As low as 18? Not even 18.50? Fuck it I'll wait.
You also called for it to test $13 Monday and drill throughout the week... so you have no idea what the hell is going on.
Holy fuck $18 lol
Gonna be 40k by 2024, Byden bringing that boomer strength to the boomer index.
A broke idiot no doubt!
PLTR 
Had to be done. That last 3-4% is all me bb ;)
Wise words
I did exactly that lol check my latest post
But how do we get our next play then?
Ahh ok

Wait did the definition of penny stock change? Previously it was <$5. Is it something else now?

Yea I initially bought in at $26 and then have averaged up to $38. Ill just buy more if it dips below that
Ehhhh we will see by eod
I still have no idea what PLTR even is but I will buy calls anyways.
Checkmate gravithists
I don't wait till it doubles, it's just a quick mental way to gauge it's room to run
What?
Doubt Moscow Mitch would sign off on any meaningful stimulus.
Yeah thinking about doing that
It may have been bought in September
Better to get in before 55 than after 55. This is far from the top friend. Tendies will be made
Thanks for the reasurrance.  IM WITH U BRO!!  SAVE IT IS>
haha seriously, just leave me be
Shut the fuck up im tripling my investment
I know I really wanted a dip. Was gonna sell puts and load up on calls and shares
Every day dude
Time to load on up some guns.
Ive diamond handed plenty of options to worthless. I know my worth.
I hope so
i stare at my positions for too much time . esp when they are all in on some dumb shit
Can't believe PLTR hasn't yet. 

CRSR has amazing products, but their valuation is so far out of whack compared to it's comparable, LOGI.
Yeah... its dropping now tho... lets see what happens next
Nope, unbridled speculation on a new technology investors did not understand and assumed would take over within 10 years
Thanks for the encouragement!
I'm discovering that is one of my shortcomings
My calls have no more patience , 12/18
Such a big dip though
Sent !!
Godspeed !!
Fuck , yeah why not !
Nah I just follow blindly with no research. No idea why it's mooning but I got 20k in it so all good
Lmao youre not fugged but the gains arent going to be retarded levels any time soon
There were tons of them in pm saying how pltr is going to tank sell now etc  etc
but what if it ends green? 
got in at 44 lets ride boys
Heart attack
Fuck it bro. I'm 50k into TH CB and YOLOing the fuck out of this one.
I want to get it but every time I wake up it's up another 10% Lol
I know everyone is on it here, but why do you think it can continue this
Negative. Just the one that's in the negative.
Dont worry hes still speaking retard, just doesnt know it yet
The price movement itself will lead to a high rise in value of any options contract bought now, which is controlled by delta.
The only why he can dumb that down more is to simply say buy
Before selling:  - What's changed about the company? - What's changed in the macro environment? - What's changed in demand? - What's changed about its' future?  - What's different from 24 hours ago?
Congrats! Where is my ps5?
Tsla, nio, and now pltr, Ive watched each one on the sidelines since inception this year thinking Id get rug pulled as soon as I bought in.
I wanted to add to my position there too but was waiting for that to pull back too.

I clearly have no idea what I'm doing
But they are LEAPs. What if PLTR gets to $50
Yes

Were gonna be halfway there today
Not nearly enough to get upset about, 20 1/15 30p

-70%
I'm buying the next dip dont worry
RH. I dont want to get locked out from trading
And a vanilla shake please
Oh okay homeboy. Hope you got some day trades left on robinhood
How them puts doing?
Ok thanks
So the strategy is to sell what I currently have and use a % to secure the profits? I will likely reinvest back into plntr as it doesnt show signs of slowing, does it make sense to just hold in that capacity?
Sell the 12/4s. Secure your bag king. Reinvest your profits when PLNTR inevitably pulls back a bit. 

Mine are 1/15 so ive got a little more tolerance for turbulence.
Look at lvl II trading data. To purchase all the shares to reach 590 it costs about $110MM. Yesterday there was a massive sell wall at 550 for a total of ~$110MM.
6 contracts of May $25c
Ill buy back in on a dip
You may be right mate. Wtf is this stock on? I need this too
lol gains are gains...?

fuck
Hell I don't know, just started doing this a week ago! lol. It's now sitting at 600%
Just now guy said he bought calls 
I'm going to take a little profit at $22, maybe sell half at $25, and depending on how it's acting hope to sell at $30.  This stock really hasn't gotten the volume support from big players yet so it has potential to take off still.  It's doing a volume of 5 million versus a similar small cap JMIA that's doing 27 million.  JMIA's average was 11 million daily volume.  Just nuts.  MGNI's average volume was 3 million, so getting to 5 million shows it's getting enthusiasm.
Thats enough DD for me. Im in.
Stonks go up, bears go down
LGVW seems like it will rip.  It's already giving me fomo.
Good look
Totally agree.
Meme strength. Also, the company has been super profitable and showing tremendous growth over the past couple years. It's a covid-proof stock too. Do your own research, but this one feels like a winner on all fronts.
That one is but someone else is getting me one if we hit $50 before Christmas.
Just an emt but thanks lol. Just trying to make some real money
felt like that 7 days ago
It sounds as if everyone already has there position.
Ahh nice, Im gonna laugh at you now to make myself feel slightly better
If I buy FDs wont I get rekt cause of the high IV?
Hmm is what youre doing buy a LEAP and sell FDs!
#like this

I just got my 3090 is so great :D
Im getting a famous last words vibe from assuming a SPAC cant go below 10. I get where its coming from but still
when it comes down today i will buy more. looks like EV is also opening red. little correction is good.
jesus those premiums
Most are

Not high enough. All dips will be bought

Same wondering if I should hop back in before the EOD today
lmao it doesn't sound like that at all. My guy is shaking his head wondering why boomers hate money.
Fuck him. I don't care what he says. I have 2/19/21 $12.5c and I was planning on holding until at least the end of the year
Idk man, I wouldnt be surprised if it did. Pltr has picked up insane momentum
Boo
200% in 3 months? I think we are winners
Mad cuz bad
Makes sense. Could be! Makes it more painful too! Ugh, I guess well see. Time and time again when I dont trust my gut I feel max pain.
I have done this several times. Robinhood makes it easy to make this mistake
Im fucked got 1,200$ in baba 275c 11/27
Gonna be $22 by open at this rate
https://imgur.com/NwgX8tX.jpg
I'm just assuming cause were down premarket and it's a holiday/semi long weekend. U might be right
I had a 19C expiration this Friday, sold yesterday. Going to get back in today March 2021
Will-do man. Thanks
You're loss.  17k deliveries guided for the quarter.  5k in Oct (record). We are looking at 6kish in Nov...and probably conservative.  Will be epic.
Yep, makes me more confident in it now
I agree. Thanks man. I got 10 contracts. letting 5 go and holding the rest.
The selloff now is people getting out of their shares, wait untill people try getting out of their calls at open
Is that a guarantee?

If it does I'm doubling down
Room temperature IQ on display. Have some faith retards
PLTR IS DEAD GET OFF WHILE YOU CAN!!!!!
I feel attacked

ARE YOU NUTS?? LIONS LOSING OBV PLAY
I expect it to be deep ITM by the 11th
I want lower so i can buy more
What! How'd you figure that? I'd love that of course but man that's a jump.. by when do you think?
And gl to you too my dude
Yeah sell the EV stocks to avoid the dump and play it safe to get in on PLTR 
Appreciate the advice. No close expirations. Maybe I'll hold. I think I'm just being a pussy. If I wanted to go cash gang for the holidays I should have taken care of this yesterday.

Godspeed.
I know but I need this whispered in my ear every five minutes or I start to have feelings
People who buy apple stock dont give af about child labor nor do they care about that guy bribing people with iPads or whatever because it doesnt effect their financials. This thing has lagged the market for like 3 months now
Whos the real  ? Refresh again mate
Well, unless you go full retard. Don't go full retard for theoretical dollars that may.or may not pay out.
Ya, I am going to keep that cash for a red channel on PLTR and buy in more.
January
I own a bunch of calls for Jan '22 as well. I'm fine taking some profits, we Gucci!
This is the way
Daaahmpit
You are down 6 million??? 

Nvm I can't read ,6 months lol
12/18 20c
No sir, this thing is on its way to $20+
Hasn't come out yet. So probably tomorrow so I think I'm good

Market opens Friday
is the wall big a 7?
FWIW $43 is a hard bottom so you can ride it back up to double profit if you want

Its 100% climbing back to $50, hope you arent playing weeklies
there is no drug like amazon options..
haha... yeah...shares...
09-16-2022 500
Yep. That's exactly what I am taking about
Q4 earnings isn't till March though, more likely he'd wait till after Q3 next month

This place is so fucked in the head
FUCKING SAME
Lambo Soon
Good Job man, I set my price target to be $100 when it was under $40 last week. So far so good. A lot of bread to be made
Your whip so cold
sure, https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PLTR&subView=institutional
Yeah for sure. Fantastic way to make some extra money will the stock is running up too
Finally a good answer lol
You have my oof
Below or above share price?
Dude....fuck  Sorry for your loss
I've watched this game before with PLTR, afternoon generally lead to a slowing and PLTR struggling against whatever resistance that it is at. If it breaks, it breaks but I think it's going to struggle against $27
Were in this together baby youre so money
It is which is exactly while it will moon
Ight Im out only lost all of today pltr gains 
-1000
Ya fuck me
PLTR $35 by 1/15
my dong grew 3 inches reading this so I am now at 4 inches
lol this did give me a laugh at the time. I cashed out. 100% on my long dated options
Right... they did those silly falcon wing doors.
Market is open Friday, dummy. It just closes at 1pm EST.
Dick taste 55%
How you feeling?  I think itll pull back and cool down before another launch next week.  No way it breaks 29 by Friday 1pm.
You're underestimating me.
You're underestimating me.
1000% long term. Get as many calls and stock as you can
it's gonna run up and then crash but will be a great leader in data over the next 20 years as well
MODS!!! Wait.. 
All my predictions since 18$ have been right
congrats and fuk u
i got 1/15. Id definitely sell by EOD if i were you. Less than one month out Theta and the whole crew starts fucking you. Markets closed tomorrow and a Friday sell off is more than possible
I'm up 250%, lol
WHAT???
Fuk you mean gayboi its at 28.3 rn
Nuh
At open, $25. Was already up like 75% of the premium 2 hours later so I closed out and the rolled into $26's.
Might roll into 27's if still looking strong later today
A whole apple? Youre crazy
RemindMe! 1825 days
I am looking at the 40s now, but they don't seem that much different in price than a lower strike for me to start a position (this is for mid to late 2021).
Rolling the entire amount. Only because my account has been beaten down so I need every dollar I can get. Otherwise I'd definitely take profit.
I didn't wanna take the chance after that premarket scare
appreciate the insight. don't mean to press you here but what % of positivty are you? just have a lot riding on this i can't afford to not be able to daytrade for 90 days or whatever the fuck it is
you're a fucking saint thank you so much
please see article dude just posted above. looks like i'm good to go
Ive made $12k off it and am mad I didnt make more. Thats how I know I have a gambling problem lol
I just donated 300 to our local food bank, Ive used them before so I cant be a cunt now
You better get all your family to buy in on the train too
hard to tell, its been on the come up since they switched from African Amazon, to African UPS
that's hilarious bc i sold about 25% to buy JMIA. bought CRSR @ $19 and its been a really nice gift. using it for JMIA now
Ill tattoo you on my leg if it does
Its not too late. I think JMIA will be the next big one after PLTR.
Its the Amazon and Paypal of Africa. The market cap is currently only ~$3B. Amazons is $1.5T, Alibaba is $750B, MercardoLibre is $75B. So yes, there is massive growth potential.
haha yeah, this wayy beyond my wildest expectations
My mannnn you bought today?
Lol no Im holding 5 of those am they are ripping
correct. that's if you're doing right
no
yeah thats gonna change my mind real convincing
wasted potential
I already missed out, and Ill keep missing out, I am too scared to buy anything no matter how obvious or free it is
Thanks man! Best to you as well boss
ATM..ass to money
your name is directly proportionate to you, dum to townerino
Come back to my insanity.
What I find rather funny isnt the outlook, but rather how can you confidently predict where a stock will be in 2 years from now 
Looks like it!
You were right
We got this
Rolled some profit into 5/2021 30c already up a little bit
Already done. Off to buy not one, but TWO orders of crispy chicken tendies
Ya prob wont pop until announcement

30 shares of gme.
Last night there was a plan to pump it using the power of WSB autist clan.
Mostly SQ shares and calls, WORK calls, and PLTR shares.
From -$1000 to -$2000
Thank you for listening to my Ted talk
It's very cringe when people are way to confident about shit. If you have friends that know shit goes up and down it can actually be super fun to trade DD and discuss things.
Same

They analyze your data so you don't have to. And they do it extremely, frightenly well.

THIS is the whey
This is my yearly school lunch money, don't hate :d
Man you nailed that prediction
I finally gave up on TSLA and bought shares. Its dumb as hell but apparently it works
R/R my friend, you do the math
How far out you got and what strike price?
You probably said the same thing about $28 last week, now here we are.

Ride where to? My fucking calls expire after Turkey day
Jeeeez. Lemme know how much it gains:loses
Vapo
I dont have calls. But I will.
nah. got in $40
In at $15. Just a speedbump to the moon
The fact that you know what that is tells me you probably don't need my advice.
Technically today is Friday. Shorts gonna cover today. Weeeeeeeee. 
RIP next time tiger
Same strike for January. We're good at this.
PLTR to the moon 
Trying to change that lmao
$2k about a month ago.
100k
yea problem is theyre 30 and 31 so i was kinda planning on riding that run and then dumping. according to the calculator the people on youtube told me to use, that wouldve been max tendies, unless it really goes apeshit
pltr 75 eow?
so it wont flag me even though it gives me the warning on rh when i go to sell them?
so its only if your trading on margin? or will i get a 90 day ban if i sell these?
i didnt know there was a limit, yea i believe im at 3
yep, I think I may hop off on this leg up and revisit you guys in the new year. free money today for retards like me.
>naked longs into narrow spreads

say that again but slower
no idea how any of this works. I have pltr 30 and 31 11/27.
The kind that keeps grandmas alive
yeah, we'll see. hoping. I saw a couple.
I would get a Palantir tattoo if that happened
Cue Mandalorian theme

Lets bang our heads together to hopefully etch it in our memories. Profit is profit .. I guess 
Ye its true, it just hurts a little bit inside but its true ik
Agreed
Calls or just stock lol Ill consider
This paragraph would be valid 1-2 years ago.
No way. $270 maybe. More likely that it just blows over though, we will see some paper hands sell and then business as usual.
Ok boomer

**COILED SPRING**
Im dumping right now too
What a time we live in huh
Thats it?
Been consolidating for too long
My apologies. Been too long since I haven't woke up and seen a million PLTR 's in this chat.
Any red at all
I AM ERECT
Yes
Lol. Buyden isn't even in office for now. This is because mango tweet about dow. Remember early September?
$PLTR gonna do a fat line at 9 AM
that's like pennies...
Do the opposite of what makes sense

SBE (ChargePoint) owns 73 percent of the charging market and growing much faster than BLNK. I prefer SBE well over BLNK
Was that statement too confusing for you?
Right? Really puts things into perspective. Wonderful mother too.
Profits, profits are what you know lol

I appreciate that!
Ehh, Im okay with losing $100... until I lose it.
No but I dont want to lose my shirt and have to sell my headphones and be forced to hear my wifes boyfriend being balls deep in her in the next room
*An all time low for TSLA. Just wondering if the price now has enticed more to come in.
Take the profits baby
Got it
It worked for Elon
Jesus Christ
Haha yeah Ive been holding them since they were Spartan acquisition.
The company is Canoo under HCAC ticker
Perfect time. No wsb curse
Do it. Butterfly Network backed by Bill Gates.
Better sell, decays really fast
It it acts like yesterday it will be close to 27 eod
Im fucking married to this shit...leaps, Calls, shares. Poster of Alex Karp on my fucking wall
Really hope so man. I want to put in some more money but looks like I need robinhood to make it faster. Fuck it should I get the free trial?
Shares/Calls?
Oh yeah, that is pretty high. I dont think its worth the downside risk playing with an IV like that for limited upside.
No indication of it stopping the climb though then it opened with a foot in the grave
I held because of how much it was rising consistently. I dont even think its overvalued its main competitor is LOGI which is sitting at 80 a share and CRSR went public like 3 months ago, rising super fast sure but I dont think overvalued
I have a 11/27 29
the thing is i do not like red and why is T H C B banned?
what a fucking scam. pulling all my money out of the platform
Same... 11/27 600c was cheap af before even cheaper now
Why do I even listen
60k sorry, europoor
Dammit youre (and those teachers in middle school) right
exactly. i used a day trade yesterday for a quick 60% profit and then bought another at EOD and sold literally at market open today for a 90% profit (only to see it rip further to almost 250%, but profit is profit i guess). i fucking hate this PDT restriction bullshit
you and me, my man
Loser
Stonks only go up
Im here with yall, so clearly Im rolling in it
Probably. It's honestly the one with the biggest potential short term upside. For NIO I'd estimate 10-20% while PLTR could do 100% from here
hm squeeze postponed to later
squeeze postponed *shrugs*
I just took my last 20 not held up in options and slammed Kodak 12 dollar 12/18
Yea agreed. They were slow to realize the tides had turned but I think they are on track now. Holding shares for the long term
Well fuck it, might as well just spam microvast, the fucking cunts
Thanks, 12/18 16c was the only thing under $64 and I dont believe in it at all but I bought anyways
sounds good

Im still buying consistently every week
Wrong. That is called profit taking. We bulls allow that once a week.
Investing.com then look at the headlining "breaking news" banner. Haven't checked prices. It just says that stockpiles fell bigger-than-expected 754k barrels

I'm not YOLOing or anything. I do not recommend a YOLO on this. But turnaround plays are kind of low-risk high reward. Next week is ER, and we should have a good idea if this will be a profitable play within a few weeks. If it's looking good, just hold. If it's going tits up, bail.
Good luck buddy!

Ill sell a put to get assigned then
I actually just sold my 520 Cs. I lost 27K on TSLA during the great battery day purge so I'll take making 22K this week on TSLA and walk, even if I miss out on gainzz. I'm 485% on the month so F it. Either way - good luck and make the right CALL!
I dont think it ever left
Allways was! (gun emoticon)
Fair enough... talking short term though
No room for negativity in my 
Bought at the open so only 20ish%

But I have $20 1/21c so Im chillen. Might sell some December calls later idk.
Go fuck yourself 
Idk but I took a bong rip and looked at the chart and thats the first thing that came to my head
If u want actual answer we just broke through 20 day average so I think were going downhill for the rest of the week to the 260s and next week will determine wether we go back to ATH or back to the 250s
Yeah what he  said
listened to it on repeat all this morning until i got tired and put on a 90s club megamix lol
Already up 30% :)
I have December 18 calls I think Im gonna huge nut and hold until December 15th
But Im such a pussy with closer expy. I had full intention of holding 2/19 25c for at least a month, but this past couple days has made me weary
I know  I realized that aint shit when i was typing it
Never trade the first candle unless you have perma steel balls.
Freals, thanks bruh. WORK 40C 12/4 ? 
Made 30% today 60% over all... Had a December 24th expiration too.  Why sell on a little dip?
On All the retards on this forum
Not really I still made 9k in two days
yeah i'm stayin out of this one now, enjoy the ride
I just came 
No thats my Christmas prediction for the stock. And the news that it will be added to the S&P500 (fuck I am hoping so). 

My PLTR 12/4 12/11 12/18 20c are printing daddy hooker money now
You are not wrong, my friend
It's one of the better batteries out there. Good long term prospects

I knew I was stupid but I didn't realize I was this stupid. Only $600 whatever
[deleted]
it's so frustrating
Im no expert, but I see that happening towards the end of next week
So there's room to grow got it
yup, atm options are $6 lol
Maybe they pulling a china then, white guy in front for the easy investor trust.

&#x200B;

Im just joking anyway, Premiums too crazy for me to play it.
Not bad. Im super nervous about my 30c 11/27
TSLA, SQ, TDOC, ROKU, CRSP, WORK ..etc are all tech names with emphasis on momentum, great for the whole work-from-home economy.
Cause Cathy Ark is a genius
Youll buy the puts or sell them? They were around $800 each when I looked. Pltr would have to be below $12 a share in Jan 23 to lose money
Wouldve been tight to sell and go into WORK gdamn
Its called diversification and it doesnt work at all
Ya think?
Okay shhh but seriously >!where is this going please?!<
No tendies in my bank already
here is a good read up on JMIA
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/JMIA/LuDof7r6-Almost-100-Upside-Potential-on-JMIA-Theoretical-Explanation/
Me to i sold 10 min ago cuz im a pus and not trying to get rich and jus make a few bucks
Im naming my gyy dog fisker
Can i get a grand please u sexy beast
Strap in for the fisker rocket its bouta cum
I cant, it goes against every rule I have ever set for myself lol. I wish I did when it was at 15 tho.
Too long. Many months, but Ive trimmed my position around 22-23
last night before close
Teach me a thing or two brother, my NET and SNOW are weighing me down. CIIC and PLTR give me life. Thats it, thats my whole portfolio
Im holding on it until probably early Jan but well see how it goes tbh
Lol yea I should have figured that
GME leaps? IV is insanely high tho
Like SPY $450 dec 2nd?
I mean if I liquidated everything about bought PLTR Jan '22 $15c a month ago I could be a millionaire. Working our way there though, just don't go boom!
You mean the meme stocks? I don't play those.

Indexes are boring af rn.
27c 12/4 here. Sold my 11/27 19c on Friday. Ouchie.
We there.
green cuz im traumatized from looking at my red portfolio
Yeah still made a bunch could of been a bunch more. Debating reentering

Done. Already up 676$ Thanks broooooooo kisses
If saruman goes 30% today idk what to say
Idek some FDs for pltr
Literally broke through paper resistance as I was typing lol
Is CIIC the next meme stock
True I lost thousands on COTY when that was a meme for a minute
ok thx ily
That was only 1% of market cap of TSLA. $ 5bn
christ this again. its like ppl truly believing in that MSFT 200c shit too

MMs have to "hedge" go delta neutral completely if they fucking didnt have the shares to begin with or other contracts to offset it.

i'm sure the option buying by the truckload by funds are making the gamma exposure for MMs off the tits on PLTR right now but no, 7,000 option buys would NOT move 700,000 shares. 

jesus christ.
I need to stop selling FDs on my long calls. It seems to only work 1/3 times. And I am selling far OTM calls.
I'm happy, still have half my position open and that is now a free money as I've covered my purchase price
Bringing some sense into the chat. These tards wont like it. Total agreement with you. Whole house will burn down
Thats true. Didnt think about that

Think I will bruh
Great company, fomo meme stock price action. It's going up and probably will keep going up for months, but that has nothing to do with the company itself.
hey, props to you :)  every time I scalp I end up losing so no more for me, haha
ya, I made this mistake with the EVs, so diamond hands this time around
Shit sorry. Im Canadian haha
Id get fucked
time for rope
never trusted my gut despite telling myself to and that Id regret it 
I need a sell all button. I need to close 27 positions if this shit caves.
1pm,
284%
You couldnt handle PLTR behind the dumpster
I prefer to call them "Money Haters"
Damn dude Im in 1/15 30c
It can do it. Give it a couple years
Once they get IPOs
gg retard
The EVs arent going to last much longer. Really seems like PLTR is getting buttrushed by big money because of us tards.
I got here right before the whole WSGod tsla posts. I miss those day. This thread looks more like stocktwits every day :'(
https://www.google.com/
(858) 571-2121
Literally the bottom! Nice job

Copy
yessir  gang
Lol. What would you pick out of PLTR and TSLA if you entered today
They said BLNK was overvalued in a tweet. Which it is. But its hurting SBE, which they actually told people to buy because they are making money.
yep
Wrong comment
TBF, it needs to pull back a little, the run has been crazy so far but I just dont see this going below $20 again.
I've seen you mention them in other comments. You holding a couple of calls too?
Doesn't matter. Had sex.
Thanksgiving my dude, US markets take Thursday off.
Why? I have no idea how long the market will stay irrational. Im just not touching this particular stock. It might go to the moon still, Ill miss out if it does. Enjoy.
Ah, but they do invest in EV and vehicle-related ETFs, which is the point of my post on why NIO is likely down.
Sikkeeee 
This is probably Kramers boomer friends taking profits Im not worried
Cant.. I put the rest of my money in PLTR but I aint fucking selling
Your wifes bull
In 8-12 weeks
I'll buy when it dips below 25.80. It is sure to dip to there. If not... Oh well, next meme

Damm, it really did not go down to 25.80... Oh darn guess I'll buy it now to not lose out
the way, the truth, and the life from where I'm standing
Was scalping with 1000 shares. It dumped and I panic sold lol.
Scalping with 1000 shares. Dumped and sold at a 250$ net loss.
No I sold a call off my shares that I just bought thinking this has to be the top no way it goes higher than strike, only for it to shoot up another 5% immediately and go above strike. So yeah big dumb
Full time student, girlfriend whos emotions fluctuates more than my portfolio, I currently have covid (for real), and all my gains Ive made are GONE
Lol bitching about life at 21? Hes just getting started
CANT smell the tuna I have covid
NIO 12/4 70 fds, Dkng 12/4 60c idk what I was thinking, video game money I guess.
You don't become rich by being a bitch. YOLO your wife's boyfriend's money
Its gonna drop. No doubt. Im not going to be bag holding but Im also not betting against you fine folks. Best of luck
Just got warned by the mods for trolling the 
Just a short stop to reload fuel brother
What's the narrative?
I don't want to lose money
The tuscan riders lol i like it
Got it. Are all spacs outlawed?
Yeah, but feel free to pump GME as much as possible
Huh. I wish mods would announce something before/after outlawing shit like this
"Chinese EV stocks lower on government investigation into the sector"
I mean NIO makes cars and has for years. 

Im pretty sure XPEV definitely makes cars. 

These other retarded penny stock tickers are bullshit, sure. So are FSR and NKLA, so, yeah.
Big if true
This is the way
What investigation?
Sick burn bro
More than half of those aren't stay-at-home. Just informing people of other options
You would think earnings would crush it and guidance for at least the next quarter or two.
This price action fucking sucks
No
LOL, you really got me. I weak handed out of it 1.5weeks ago.
As soon as I get that second pump of sweet medical nectar into my arm Im not working my mask ever again. It makes no sense for vaccinated individuals to wear one. Rednecks dont wanna wear masks? Just get vaccinated!
Welcome to the retard crew. I actually hope all corporations and public locations require vaccinations to force the anti vaxx smooth brains to get the vaccine. Also, the flu vaccine is less effective because its essentially a good guess at which strains will be dominate that year. The flu is too good at avoiding our attempts to hold it down. Covid this isnt the case right now. Maybe if enough smooth brains forego vaccination then itll get a chance to mutate and fuck us forever.
What are the rules for it? Comments can have it but posts cannot?
Thats what Ive been doing so I should be happy with my wins. Had one of my best months ever in November just taking profits as they come.
I think I just might ride with you on this one sir
Yup think this is my play just contemplating moving some other shares around to accommodate in my long term portfolio
No idea I went full retatf
Exactly
Yeah. Im fortunate Ive got enough capital at the moment I can let the AAPL ride. I do think its gonna moon in the coming months but fuck, get on with it.
i guess if i sold it now for a 10% gain that would make me pretty gay right? tp hands?
He sure was.
Thank you and I know this wont last forever. I cashed out calls except for PLTR right now...Im gonna go back into something but waiting for a good dip from DKNG
Wrong "to" dipshit
I just started doing options yesterday to get my feet wet, I dumped $2,000 in to robin hood to see where it gets me.
What DD did you do for MGNI? I didnt see anyone mentioning it
Because my calls are up 200% and climbing. Fuck all that analysis, looks like a solid company and is on the run up
I didn't buy calls until Nov. So that was just shares
Apply snowflake multiples 
Totally agree. And if the CCP wants something to happen, it will happen -- look at the way the way they've grown their economy and the middle class over the past four decades, look at their coronavirus response. I think their country has a much better understanding of the implications of climate change and the need for green energy than the US.
Regulation is necessary. Companies will find a way to adapt.
I love this retarded sub but does no one understand this?
This is pure entertainment but I get genuinely concerned for some folks here
Which companies are they investigating ?
Because people can't read.
I mean, I get that people are worried that this will grow into more scrutiny into the whole sector. I think companies like JD took a hit when Beijing called Jack Ma in and suspended the ANT IPO, right?
Lol when shit like this happens it impacts the sector.  Stupid reply
I think it's my ceo just playing some HR video over zoom
Who hurt u
Go buy yesterday
I bought at 13, sold at 26... Wanted to wait for 25 pull back but decide fck it, buying at 27 won't harm my profits that much
I just may
Probably will. Might grab a real stock position
I don't think it will stay at 20 long, but maybe hits 20 midday Friday in a profit taking selloff and bounces back to 21 EOD Friday. It would still be nearly a 15% gain for the week.
I think BABA will have trouble holding above 300 until after Jan 15 when 25k 300c contracts expire worthless. I have an iron butterfly 270/300/300/330  hoping we sit right at 300!
bUy tHE DiP
The ones in quetion were green after hours and closed 2.5% higher than what theyre showing and yep howd ya know
no options in the UK gay country
Woah, look out, this guy has a single example!
The diff is that investigation was spearheaded by muddy water, do u kno who launched this? Seems more like a way China can be like yup everything looks good 
Yes, they will. Literally exactly what happened with LK.
Is that a no?
I haven't slept and about to go under... lol am I gonna wake up sad or happy?
SLG looking good
Im gonna see if I could start to buy
Cmps and another that automod won't let me post
I had a roku tv. Moved super slow. I love the fire stick. Its just this CNBC app that gives me issues for whatever reason.
My man
Yeah, I had thought about selling all of it yesterday when it was dipping so I could clear out some stuff before the long weekend. Oh well. I think I have time to accumulate shares again, looking for dips in the teens. I always think the time to sell is the day before you think the time is to sell and this year that has been true a lot.
prolly wont
Tendons
lol bro wut u know about this
is it really gonna hit 100 though?
Neither were mentioned.
Algos sees only the words "Electric vehicle and investigating"
Only on the weekends
Ill let you know that so far its been ridiculous. 

Not since I was a kid have I ever seen things sell out like this in the video game industry. The last time I had to pre-order something was *Gears of War*, the original, which was like what, 14 years ago now? Although it seems its more of a supply chain issue than stores actually selling out of a significant amount of product.
Well I'm actually +116% but waking up to this dip making want to sell, but thinking the EV rally DOA as of today
Good one. /s
Sell for my sake bro 
I wrote it when it was at 63 to collect $258 of premium ... an hour later it was up 36% and at 73 (In the money). I was down almost 750 for a minute there
I dont know, I was just considering buying in but it looks like were having a major pullback on ev for now
They said to buy out into mid December. So far its more profitable than the calls Im holding today 
naked calls before and synthetic to hold after in december
I got greedy only making $2000 profit in a matter of an hour so I went in with over $7k. Commissions and fees on them are hefty too.
I have no idea. Check your brokers website? I had over $10k when I started trading them.
I am one of those long term investors you hear about sometimes on here about. I just love me the short term meme stocks too :)
It was at $21 after hours, I bought yesterday before close, like $0.03 off the low of the day for my puts
Ayy glad to hear someone else here love it. Deff doesnt get enough recognition. Someone whose not into electronic would probably think it sounds so weird haha
Borrowed money
Betting someone elses money
to who?
Why the 3rd?
I got in at top, doing pretty well
Thank you for this
Yeah what is it 
sounds spiffy. must buy contracts
its a real shame too, because hydrogen fuel cell energy is really promising in autistic peoples hands, but Nikola is retarded af
lmao, koalas maybe?
Crudes been ripping, mightve bought at the top here tho
Live and learn I guess. I also had $10 solo puts I bought when it hit $13 and I got rid of them too
There are no smart play rn.

But if you really wanna go bearish, long-dated SPY or QQQ I'd say.
I do that too. I trade on schwab for my IRA and fun money with RH. Schwab is never down lol
right but with a millions working dividends you can make a few 100k a year right
what does he do with his time?
Alice Walton
yup i meant dividends, thanks
VVS hands good sir ...VVS hands
Build up 20k through hard work & then risk 75% of that tops
I dont i got 150k vanguard account. I buy stonks every week.
Definitely retarded. Missed out on a lot of $$$
I said if I made 100+ Ill sale, my stop loss was -100$ tryna discipline myself on day trades lol they havent gone my way for not being my disipline
Teach me how to trade calls
Cant buy pltr options in Germany. Need a new broker where I can. Bought it when it was 11 or 12
Good man!!!
Data... you know the thing people with real money care about....
New housing, personal spending, core preparation price index.... hits in 5 minutes.... you know that data.
Happy cake day
NO
When you have a market rally to all time highs you usually want broad market participation. This isnt very broad
He's making it up as he goes to sound important
Ah yes, PLTR is the boomer stock. I want to sell APPL but its negative and Im not selling a fucking loss 
Aaaand we are back on track... keep it!! 26 eod
Bullish
No, they still havent been entered in the s&p, they havent bought shares yet. TSLA is yet to moon. Its just my luck that a ass hole think 10k cars being recalled is significant
Pretty sure they recently avoided bankruptcy by getting funding from someone, Cinema-something-or-other
In the next couple of weeks if not sooner, next week weeklies were hit. But Amazon has lagged lately and with holidays kicking off, they should be doing well
nah TSLA, could have bought 12/4 565C for 17.15, now 20.60
I am talking about the up $6 you silly fuck. 49% in a day is indeed mooning.
I swear the stock needs to dump more before the lock up ends, those grifters should not be allowed to sell for over $20 a share. $2.50 is too much.
Ok now Im really kicking myself. I took the good gain when I could have had a great one.
No problem buddy
Yes they are. You can check my post history for pics.
You cant spell internet without NET
[deleted]
appreciate it!
I mean, that's around the time I bought my calls, but it's still got room to grow from here for people that might want in. 
Yesterday it spiked in the morning then slowly decreased throughout the day then spiked again at the end. So if it follows the same trend then probably around 12-1 est. But it most likely wont be exactly the same as yesterday so theres no way to know for sure
Breaking
I picked up like 5 names LOL
Lfgooooo
It was for attention
What a fucking disappointment
pretty strong ascending triangle so it should
App
One day well get there haha
Loaded up on 1/15/21 calls at open today. Let's go!!
You selling e.o.d?
Just bought 1/15/20 30c
When it changes to CNOO before 2021 it'll surge to $15+.
Based on Logitech?
Oh I didnt even realize cuz the memes pumping lol
Whats driving the move
Aye aye captain
Yikes, I had a 19 call which I did same thing.
I'm too poor for leaps
not idiot, shares
But reverse the order
Hehe
3 months or until your portfolio is worth $25k 
Whats the benefit of going with a higher strike?
Damnnnn
I feel you bro
Interesting
I feel you dawg. I'm gonna keep it I think
exactly! and scared chicken-little autists were doing their thing last night.
No, the evangelion one you wanker
I'm afraid covid news might put a damper on the Thanksgiving trades... but idk... cases are surging.
lol $51k worth
Nooooo.... 
Yes it is - Im in tears - hated that cheating fuck for hand if god but he really was the GOAT!
Now we gotta look for Big tuna
Wow. Youre about to be a very rich man.
Im already loaded to the tits
Dont worry about 570
Melted through 570 within the span of one 1minute candle
Finally WORK will move - the flattest tech stock this year!
Somehow this is all the motivation I needed. Thanks dad
Potential acquisition by salesforce
Crm in talks to buy work
Salesforce in talks to buy them
I have been in and out over the last few months. Seen decent gains. But I really like what Im seeing for the next few months. Just got in on some $90 12/18s.
That came out of nowhere haha
sniped it after 2nd halt
Done
$15 Calls Dec 18. Picked them up on November 19 for $1.02 a piece.
Spoke way too soon!
We did it!
Will hit 30 EOD at this rate
Lol just blew through 27
Wish you add a comment when closing a position "noobs"
Agreed. Ive got about 55 SPXS calls expiring anywhere from Dec 18 to April 21
Hell yeah! Gratz
it has to go to $300 or im broke we cant test $270
Even spaceships need to stop to refuel now and then
Just selling before the long weekend because holding that long with the market closed is risk.
And here I thought wsb controls the market
W
Only people geeking out rn are weekly tards expecting 300 by friday
Buy all the SPOCS you downgraded! Thank me with commission, my next big whale is LGHL. Been loading up, increased my portfolio holding on that boy by 33% this week. Its the Chinese Robinhood and Im betting on degenerates like me sitting in China!!!!
Which part?
Slack
But then youd lose it on something else so whats the difference
Lolol we shall see. If it dips i use the gains for more calls 
XPEV CRSR NIO treating me well today

Hate getting IV fucked by flat days on puts. Feels bad lol
Very true. SPCE was a greedy/compulsive buy for me for sure. I guess it makes sense, what goes around comes around
Lol..I hope they come to their senses and dont buy it.. 18b for a fancy emoji app lol
If u find something good let me know plz
Ive got 28,500 ($38,000) Im going to go all in on Tesla shares for the hour and see what happens
Do you mean don't pay off in full? So if my statement  says I owe $550 by December 04. Don't pay the full $550? Or are you saying if my limit is $1000, then don't use $1000 each month?
450 in profit. $2.00 option price, sold at $6.50
By the nine you're right how could I have been so blind ;) I'll double my position..
Old news recirculated today. India expanded list of apps it's banning from iOS and Play Store. Includes AliExpress.
No material impact to BABA but more investor spook probably caused some selling today.
I'm setting a little aside just in case it dips.  I think expectations are a little too high for earnings, but Cohen could take the reins at any time.
I know you are fam.
I'm still up 100% on CRSR tho
Virtual investor day. Removed though so no one thinks its earnings
Virtual investor day
Yeah I was just thinking about going in bigger at 27 and then fuck
Ya I'm trying to get some 28c on a dip but shit keeps going up lol.
Ya
I know fuck. Im worried therell be some serious profit taking with tmrw being closed so I dont want to wait too long, but a leg up wild be nice.
Lol yeah I do but I also think itll drop around 3ish just hopefully not sooner.
Cant complain either way haha
Dec 04. My 5 PLTR calls went from .97 to 8.10 currently. I think more than 400% omg
You dont think this is just a phase and theyll dump? Whats the reason for such a huge increase over the last week?
Not even available lmao
I regret every time I have sold to make profits but at least Im rolling it into additional profits. 

....god if this goes down to $25 next month it will be so depressing.
Thanks. I may sell my initial investment and let the rest soar to space.
I'm with you. I am going to sell my initial investment and the remainder is going to stay and ride this rocketship to uranus.
Looks good. How far out and strike?
OEG 12/18 2.5c (8 contracts),
GE 12/4 12.5c (20 contracts)

hard to type with all this drool on my keyboard.
i dont think im trading on margin? i put 2k into rh bought and sold palintir calls... am i stuck with my retard meme 11/27 calls now?
why is the market closed tomorrow?
I can't do these high IV plays anymore.  Gotta get more basic bitch.
U right
370
Youre new arent you
If youre rounding up
I believe some one will start covering after merger. Fisker got $26 buy rating from citi today.
i sold calls not puts
Im in for 1/15 22.5c and 12/18 25c. I also have no idea tf im doing.
I guess if theres enough open interest on the contracts I should be able to sell by 2022 right?
How does $60 sound? Reasonable? Doable?
What makes you say so?
And some gay bears not and some other , I sir am not a gay bear
$150 next year
you know what? i don't like ur attitude... sincerely stan
oh fuck!!! and i just doubled down not even considering this thx!!!
nah got a decent Samsung 2020 model in the cart right now (researched it last night its good and I like the samsung remotes have a 70 samsung and 70 vizio right now)

but yer right the Black Friday ones tend to suck (I have had good luck with mine though)
November 9th for 4.40
Id sell you mine only 25bucks
I got owned by a stop loss order.  I made 1K profit from 12/18 30c.  If i held, I'd be at 4k right now. I need to learn to muscle through this anxiety and watch the winners ride up.
Go back to sleep
I got a call spread im already up 54% but if that contract 570 expires worthless ill net the premium
4 call vertical buy at 550 and sell at 570

Picked them up for $700 a pop
Done with my day trades unfortunately otherwise Id be tempted
How are you gonna time it tho? Is there a way to get a notification for it? 

Also, will an option chain be out right away?
Hence the "supposed"

Am as skeptical as you are
Am trying to reassure people of the long term outlook.

It's good to disregard short term day to day movements and look at the big picture (daily/weekly charts)
Losing monies is my strong suit. Spelling, not so much.
Market cap
Its bs
No offense intended but I will always think of you as the MGM guy.  Since that was the first time I started recognizing your username.
Who are you?
I think one day the daily discussion thread had like 8k comments around lunch time and I was like woof wtf is going on here.

We are already at 5.5k and market is not even open yet. Most people don't flood in here until exactly 9:30
Honestly lots of times I am in emotional shock processing whatever TF happened myself; so its hard to remember these.

For instance; I barely remember what the daily threads looked like during the Circuit Breakers but I watched every single one on my screen and looked at the clock each minute lol
Lol. Fuck i meant any day before market open today
Early December. No date right now.
Because its a SPAC thats how they work
To convince you to buy it.
Holy shit. How many you got?
Forget the line I need to beg for that dollar bill to snort
Logically the only thing we can do boys.... is buy more

|-|-|-|-|
The China EV shit.

XPEV is down almost 11 percent
NIO is down 8 percent.

That violent pullback.
Taking profit from a huge run up and timing the rug pull to short it are two totally separate things.

Anyone who was in those positions for longer than a week and didn't make money should not be whining.
strike?
I thought Florida decided they dont give a shit
woah this dude has got a straight line to some super secret intel source...whats the secret??
Neat, discounts on the market are coming up then.
Same, was refreshing to hear this
All the girls say hes pretty fly for a white guy
yea I was overweight tech.... tech not ev has not done great this month
Nah two red ev days, perfect time. Im doubling up lmao
Im up already today. Bitch.
Yes but arguably, PLTR is more impactful/scary.
Listen, I work in analytics. Data is the future but some people see these companies as threats to the gen population
22
i thought i was the only one. you guys notice the cup and handle on the daily chart?

I dont want to believe it, but i wouldn't be surprised if this thing is back at $30.
We're all gonna retire within a year at this rate
I bought dip at 25
Jun 2021?
You are not too late to the party. This is the IBM of our lifetimes
Yea I get that hey this company has a fuckton of future potential but whens a good time to think the price. I feel like NIO was $45. BYND WAS $250 last year. Any reasonable price tags to consider? Im looking at other army contractors that are around $65. I think it should go up to only $37-40 before true correction comes in. Im curious to know other peoples take, bullish or bearish.

I know I know just know a lot of PLTR call holders are up a lot and it might be a good time to take some profit just to be sure
Mesla
Agreed with GME pressure
2nd on CRSR, buy the dip before it goes to 60
gj!
I have other plays I want to use this capital for.
Maybe I wasnt clear, im fine with "getting left behind" if thats the case. over 100% gain in 5 trading days is more than enough for me haha.
First one is free, may as well go all in.
i understand options well enough, just no experience. thats why im asking you retards
$30 strike?
End of hour
You still should, just not yet
Not yet let buy side consolidate more, if it dips a bit then def buy
Ya.. in my head I know it was the smart move but fuck it sucks sometimes
The stock wont have a 1% down day and 15% up days, its first red day will be pretty harsh
Know any good oil stocks?
I like how you think
Its undervalued, it should keep goin up lol. I can understand pullback but 12% is kinda wack
Somebody needs to be the voice of reason around here
Yes I learnt it yesterday
lol yeah I did 
it won't rally but it shouldn't be down, sus af
Not for nothing, but he said it'll pump after the merger is finalized which is in a few weeks.
He said wait in a few weeks read the post
with a good time?
you correct but at the time of writing a barely green day (0.011%) is nothing to cry over
So many bulls trapped themselves
Just the tip
Hehe
Not bad
99% tech
so go in with like 30% and wait for it to potentially go lower?
Every fucking time I buy it, it dips further
I know I believe in it too. So glad I went all in 2 weeks ago right after their first earnings report. Just not used to making money like this hahah
The pullback would be really nice not gonna lie
Im staying locked in. I have zero intentions of selling shares or my 2022 calls. I do have some feb 2021 calls I thought about selling today, but I decided to wait til the 1st week of December to cash out.
Boomers are gonna hear about PLTR gains from their kids this week and tomorrow and likely want to get on board.
Lmao
Gotta believe bro 
For real.  announced as breaking news on cnbc
I don't
Doesn't matter
Mods bought it at top then sold at bottom probably then got pissed
LMAO you losing money today huh
I bought a lambo bro
R/woooosh
Im gonna staple my nuts to your forehead
Thats right. Tendies recycling into tech
Weed bee
wanna buy high?
Ok bear
Averaging down is a beautiful thing
his tweets are less coherent and more crazy than Amanda Bynes on a bender
Oh thats a relief . Win win boys.
Gotchaa realized Ive been using TDA app but maybe think or swim would be better
Seriously concerned about security on Android
He got pumped and doesn't even know it
Fuck off.
Phew
Do you think thats possible? I was looking at 12/31
Ok
How do you know this fucktard here got his first long call at 60c 4/21 yesterday kinda pissed I should have waited but did it drunk late night
Buy
i don't own, but i definitely wouldn't sell after a -12% open lmao
Gay bear will when you learn, its been 9 months of calls
Buying shit blue chips.
Did you buy puts Yesterday is the question
Im not fucking selling but damn son
Good thing I sold my 35c earlier in the week otherwise Id be fucking crying too
600C 11/27s I hope. If hes a man
12/24 $600, $700, $800

...because I'm not a man
Ok that baby was me
Lol. Explains the bullshit market moves yesterday then
Because the pump is a dump I understand
Cool. Understood
Jan 2022 50c got about 60% of my portfolio in these
Hell yeah. Got my girl Erin at my nearest location
Made me 4k in calls and shares with their earnings
Idk what that means.  Explain like ur talking to your dog
Shouldve earlier
thank you - you, sir, are the diamond in the rough
my favorite that was told to me here is TLT (thank you u/MossfonBVI), also looking at BND, IEF, TIP
Your wife likes to compare completely different men, you and her boyfriend.
Sorry. I meant closing early. I can see the confusion.
Fair
This was my first trade. WSB convinced me to get my feet wet
The ole roll out and up!
Ok autists, in at 44.7$
Luv u too
He kept talking about $FDX
this friday lmfaoo
lol. rude awakening doesnt mean you dont do your plays. it just means you keep hedges, and take profits.

also alot of these tards all in on everything and youll never see when they go to 0 which is like a gurantee to happen if you dont take profits
I will keep it then since I regret not buying more shares at $10, the share price ran up too high too fast
exageration. very close to 100%
I've been in since the DD at 328 shares, thought the activity died down but I forgot it was a banned ticker 
I did, didn't see anything. mostly I was asking cause I figure branson reads this sub
Thank you. I am all in now.
Nice
If this is actually retail pumping this, they're going to want their gains for thanksgiving. If I lose, I lose, and deserve it.
Go here https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/call-spread.html and plug in the price you bought the option at, and then the price you can sell a call above that strike for
depends on when you sell the calls
My plan is to sell at +10-15% if we make it there again briefly, and I'm not holding overnight.
Its cheap so who cares
Im a bull brother just kinda scared
Its bullish we just gonna have 1-5 red days in 2024
To the right
This is what I think so I sold at ~25.40
0 revenue, 20 million in losses, over 30% increase in 2 days and a 1.5 billion market cap. So why exactly ?
Sold all my calls. Only have shares
Thanks dude. I knew it was a dumb question, but I haven't had one work out this well with time to spare. That was my original thought, but I didn't want to be overlooking something somehow. I appreciate the info and advice.
Congrats on your new money
Good luck bro! You holding stocks or calls?

Instant Classic.
The Deficit Myth - Stephanie Kelton
Second this
Look up modern monetary theory. So the central bank can print money digitally, they buy government bonds which are promises to pay money back. Government spends this money and the central bank just destroys the bonds. Back when supply was limited and we were all poor this would have caused inflation but with 0% inflation since 2007 we could directly finance a lot of programs such as healthcare and house building just from printed money.
No need to raise taxes to pay for gov shit when jpow and co can just print money to pay for gov shit, everyone wins

Depending on your time horizon that could be from frying pan to fire. Get out before S&P admission
ur seeing leaps that far out ?  E*TRADE only has til June 2021
Chinese EVs are getting raped. Am on CRSR and PLTR too. What you on bro?
360 11/27
Ya that wont be ITM until mid day today
But what if he says no merge
He said don't buy PSTH, no merge
?? Its literally at yesterday 1pm level
Its up like 50% on the week. Wtf? 
Seems like everyone is panicking because the Chinese government launched an investigation in the sector. As far as I can tell though, the investigation is only into two specific companies (and no, neither one is NIO, XPEV or LI). It seems like an overreaction.
Invesitgation
News of Chinese investigation into EVs plus I think the EV hype will move on to something else, I haven't looked up the specifics yet (EDIT: Looks like it's two companies I've never heard of, Evergrande and New Energy Vehicle, but they're investigating the entire sector.). I'm holding NIO long term though, so I wouldn't be too worried about this.
Calls expiring December 25. Hold or sell?
Hold
You think that hurts. My 11/27 280c where ITM at close

*All* my gains yesterday Thanos snapped into oblivion after hours
Im betting it goes down but not just a straight fall, I'll probably just offload all my calls on the bounce
REEEEEEEEE
Yes sir
I been going religiously 5 days a week since they reopened. Gonna be super lame when they close
so retarded
$600c 11/27 for ultimate FD? Or you doing something more reasonable?

Thanks! Hopefully that 22.80 to 22.90 holds up and we moon from there
Thanks for checking.. i was just playing..
Truuu
Yea, but your mom doesn't
God I fucking love WSB. Cramer probably cokescrolled that comment and has another mini stroke.
That's Bob Laser
[deleted]
you could've also lost in 1 day what it would take you 2 weeks to make
Easy come, easy go. This aint just about making big gains. Managing risk is also part of the skill set cause once you yolo and hit 0 its game over. Dont always have to go for options, trading shares is fine too. Leaps and shares are slow but they can keep you in the green, save those risky plays for situations were you think its worth it.
Yep I'm all in with shorts. Will exit today for a nice gain
Right, 6 million GM for the Takata airbag shit this week!
all in on this plan lol
It's not "trusting" polls i just think the race is closer than the market is pricing in rn. I'm expecting a December tumble with a January .
Futures were ripping last night
really hope so
and like Michael Burry... he gamed the system, spectrum gang ftw
Fuck it I'll get in. I'm tired of missing out on meme stocks
Jesus Christ good job getting in yesterday
you are the type of guy who gains and looses 100 max. in a day with leveraged spy calls lmao
Fuck it i even bought 100 shares pre-market.

Calls at open
FSR WAS the play!
Thats mildly comforting, what u think it's gonna be eow?
Its less than 1% of their sales.
It was consolidating all yesterday afternoon then started trending up. If it wasnt for that BS news that does not include NIO, it would be up today, its consolidating again right now. Ready for a breakout.
Break out
Probably panic sold calls and bought puts
Made some big gains yesterday then lost it again on a pump and dump DD that was stickied on the front page 
You'll get it next time buddy
It's not like I can get any less able to ever retire.
it's pluggin' but this could be a < 10 AM thang
fuck seriously? 
Markets closed tomorrow right?
ANd it's only open to 1pm on Friday.
Sweet. Yeah I doubt it will hit $60. 
Extra easy $90 bucks in my pocket with the premium.
I have 22C 12/18, I just sold 30C
in my monkey brain it is
they're march calls and it got killed by greeks. just need a strong 2% day to be back in the game.

sold weeklies against them. i'll be fine.
Not for sake of company type but in terms of retard strength
EKG machine lol
Whats wrong with just holding this till EOY? Already ITM. Was pretty deep yesterday when it was trading at $50.
Yeah they really are
oh ive been on the PLTR train. LEAPS were bought back in oct.
I was thinking 1/15 560
Im autistic
Rip through that resistance all the way to 280
Typo, I mean 113.50, not to the ground at $13 lmao
What time will it close?
$2.95 lmfao
Coolio. Im down -12% from my peak today after making that trade lol. Thanks
just be careful of IV crush because there is a huge chance they keep it gridlocked to crush everyone
Until it actually breaks out. Thats why Im a month out
Should I just sell now?
I will wait until 43
Sometimes your arms get tired from holding bags 

I am at 25% profit right now on 500 shares. Closing 300 of those, will let 200 ride out to $55 maybe
Just my whole portfolio. It's supposed to be green everyday

Fuck it I'm sold.
Thats what I thought. Thanks.
Profit is profit
This is my first year trading, so Im likely understanding wash-sale wrong.  Im under the impression my deferred losses effect my tax reported gains.  Basically Im up 6k, but if I dont allow my deferred losses to settle I could be taxed at higher gains.

Yes get into mother nature and pump American solar
I have 3/19/21 90c. I'm going to be patient but it's hard thinking about what I could've yolod into instead
Not enough volume for me
Had like 20% gain in under 30 minutes so I just sold. Can always rebuy when it slips lower like its doing now.
already in profit, so turns out i got my answer in like 10 minutes
Would give you gold if I believed in e-coins.
yes
Im sitting at 4 now, once you hit 5 they restrict your account which I dont want to happen
Thats about what I got out at but mine were 11/27 23c, got about 200%

Why lol
Why shares and not options?
mother fuck never selling PLTR covered calls again
Thanks a ton. I'll buy it back and roll it out.

Fucking PLTR. Never selling CCs on this.
I don't know about green but we should bounce off the lows pretty well. Hopefully the euphoria returns and we go big green.
Very fair I might chill after today and switch to stocks
Bro they own Elgato/scuf...its the esports/streamer play and Look at where boring Logitech is at. I sold my calls earlier in the week too but I dont see this stopping till 60ish 70ish. May be wrong lets see
Each day?
I bought $6c exp 12/31 and Im up big. If I were just getting in now, maybe $7c exp 12/31? If not move expiration out this guys going on a nice run
Obvi my comment was an exaggeration, 
but 5 AMZN 11/27/2020 3190.00 C. Bought them today at kind of a high price though so currently down. Was hoping to just scalp another small movement , but it dropped.
Oh I'm balls deep in pltr. But I would like all my stuff to go up.
Nice
Oreo Milkshake or Miami Ultras
Yeah
Knowing my luck... If I hold these 11/25 363p it will moon, and if I sell well instantly get a 2% correction today
I think I have a fossil I bought in the 90s somewhere.
Yeah, I didn't look too much into it.  Figured if amazon is just entering the market, they'd have something good.  At the very least something better than a fitbit.   Figured the subscription would just be offsetting the up front cost.  Its got a body scanner app thing....so you gotta take naked selfies.  Might just be bezo's end game.  Mass black mail and extortion.

It's fucking stupid but I think you're right
almost every other weed stock is red and apha green, doesnt usually happen. just broke 7.10

No that's what I mean. Like it'll be 30 EOD so it will have only been in the 20s for 3 days total.
IM NOT FUCKIN LEAVING! 
Not even scared Im just debating best moves at this point but youre right
ahh ok
Ha yeah i was able to get out, flipped 150 to 4500 
They might get acquired by salesforce
CRM looking at buying it out
[deleted]
Agreed
Not official they held talks dont let the title scam u
They have problems after problems
Yeah I lied, just bought more on the dip
Yeah I'm a little retarded too
Actually bought shares on IPO but miss me with that 1 contract you bought this morning lol
Yea I sold off my portfolio this morning after huge gains past few weeks. Trying to determine what to do next.
Pspltr
What stock is this?
I fomo'd in and I don't think fuel cells will be utilized for at least 5 years (mass scale). It's still very much in research phase. solar panels and wind prices are only decreasing now, fuel cells will definitely be more expensive to use. Good idea but expensive
so why is work down but slack is up ? man these fucking tickers are confusing.
Thats wha Im
Saying, I have 25c 27c and 28c, and even Im feeling scared on the 28,
So idk might sell the 29 
Yeah
I did, months ago, and sold them for like a 10% profit. Fuuuuuuuu
Thanks, Goku-san. What stocks do you like?
What stocks are you looking at for better gains?
idk, but if its true their logistics operations is working well, then i can see fedex/ups buying it
oof
BLNK has 50k+ app downloads. SBE has 100k+ no brainer
think again ya noob
lol get fukt. WORK coming down
I would have to agree with you, incorrectly.
100% agreed
I don't know if that's true anymore. They've watched Tesla explode and understand that going EV is their only chance at survival. I'd be more worried about the Japanese auto companies, who are fast becoming irrelevant.
I use the Chinese shitcoin exchanges that give you leverage exclusively lol
I think the short squeeze ship has sailed for GME. Could happen again, but needs some sort of catalyst

362 is the options pivot, I'm shorting anything above and buying anything below. But fucking VIX keeps dying
So if I buy crm and work calls I can hedge myself
My call was up like 40% now its only up 10%. It was really cheap so Im not worried but I just cant remember what made me buy this shit
$34.50 is the same price as $35 for 12/9. Lol what even are options.
Puts? Lol
Thanks brother 
They already announced. Metromile. Mark Cuban is an investor too
Shit up buttlicker youre probably anti vax which is ironic considering ... u kno
100%
I fell asleep back then on my new PRPL mattress. It was so comfortable I just woke up
Honestly, no idea on where it's going lol. Just gonna hold THC and NBAC for a while
WSB retards were spamming the shit out of it 2 days ago lmao
Might go down  Warrants still seem undervalued
Ye, they're just another spac. But they're interested in EV charging stations, and that's what's hot rn
Oh I have why I just bought that cal but want reassurance that its a smart play
Have you seen it mentioned here at all yet? I just bought in two weeks ago.
Promise me you will hold and I will to?
Good point. I forgot the motto: never cash out.
No shit. They run it up so much you dont know when its going to correct.
Because most people didnt buy into it. But after seeing the retard strength that WSB can add to a stock Im sure we can make SLV great again
$40 end of week, $100 for christmas because US gov will want to make bold announcements to lift everything up. Then sell.
So does not matter to us correct since we couldnt buy before public? Or will that have some sort of implications on us?
Lol whats ur prediction?
Love it
I know, just felt like pointing out the prett vertical line.
after market tonight will pump 10% and a further 10% premarket tomorrow - not financial advice!
Lets (new) hope Han. Lea aint lookin so great.
Im just bagholding. Feelin sad. Hopefully friday is better
I feel retarded for not selling eod yesterday
Random hearsay but we know Disney has a bunch planned with the Marvel releases starting in Jan. Investor call is 12/10
thank you! I am dumping this like a cheap whore and moving it to PLTR.
i bought baba calls at open
I'll buy a call and crash that sucker just out of spite of you autists!!
Why Webull?
I think MOnday it will get back to normal and be at $50 again. End of next week I can probably see close to $60 but idk
I need spider man so Im holding
Is that a general rule? They will sell the shares first most times? Honestly it's mostly the same to me but I'm just curious.
Personally I would put TSLA at half its value right now. Whether it takes a month or a year to get there, idk
I entered for a 13 cent credit (so 13 dollars), max profit is the width of the spread and where the extra short call is worth 0

So if 30 at expiration my profit is $513, break even is at $35,anything beyond 35 is a loss
True not a meme stock still good gains though
It got halted lol, sales force deal
Right!! I waiting for it to fuckin go up and it cant get past 90
Thought you woulda at least waited till earnings call my guy
rope
maybe you guys are
20k is going to come.
It was keeping up this morning. Not so much at the moment.
https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/

Put call at 2 year low lol
I don't have any position on PLTR
Thank you, thank you. CRSR Perma Bull here. I appreciate it
Same

Hell yeah brother cheers from pluto
25c 12/24 or 12/31 for me
I m not saying in one day. By Monday u will see 35

Name a major DoD or National Security theatre and chances are Palantir is running their data collation, analysis and presentation.
They make data collection software for governments and will soon go commercial too. That is not accurate information but its the best explanation my undeveloped mind can produce. Clearly my DD is of a high calibre. 
He does but he's gotta go easy on the red meat and fats so it works real good
Do it. Ill like it. 
I didn't say today, did I retard?
I was thinking of setting a trailing stop loss after the insane run but Im not a bitch
Fr, should PLTRstreetbets
Do you know how they work or you just gonna spam clown emojis to look like you know what youre talking about?
I mean, Ackmans is fine 
heart attack and passed away
Read news. Was heart attack
scew that I bought the dip cause I am seriously FOMOing.
27 or 28s? It sucks man but hey, we profited all that matters
I know  do you think Friday or Monday itll still be flyin?
Just kept going up right? I've been told stocks only go up.
Europe spends half the year on vacation
Would if I could! Got leaps with strike 16 @ 13,5ish and watched it go down to 9,x before starting the moon mission. Now we ride!
*slaps you*
Im tarded
19,263
Remind me...
That food is edible as long as it hasnt been on the floor for more than 3 days?
$800 more so
It will never see those levels again.
<3. May we both make tendies
Either way puts printing
lol
everyone bought 200's..lol
Now do baba
Thanks. Could be worse I guess.
Yea I saw it when it was -11% hence why I was so scared to look now.. at least its starting to go in right direction
You get some hedges when you open up your positions. Not sure what you're not understanding. My point was to hedge when you enter a position. I was asking if the market was going to dump at open.
How much you down this week?
Noice!
eoh
Yeah and there was no sign of it tripping and falling in the dirt.
...
...
If I daytrade a fourth time how long will they lock my RH account and will it affect me in any other way? Or my other accounts?? Thanks in advance I need to know I might sell my PLTR calls and just say fuck RH
Also bought; it will come back up.
Its easily shooting back up within a week
Im thrilled for *you*
I'd be stoked with 14.99 tbh
Yessir
Bought the dip last Friday, got me a crisp 100%
Nobody tell him
Yah
LOL
how is that reasonable ? :D
PLTR. I just feel bullish on evaluation of 50 billion
Call me bullish, Im going with PLTR
For sure, safest bet out there
Hahahaha Im using that from now on

hmm...I dunno. +16% for the day seems to be the magic number
why the fuck is it up almost 8000% in a month?!?
I'm too lazy to look into the differences but ARK bought IPOB I believe
wdym.   How long has the endless pumped last for last time?
Buy low, and selling even lower?
Oh meant the kinda coke you sniff
Yes Im done being a bear 
Fuck it lets goooo
Yeah, that's what I'm feeling.  I don't wanna leave any tendies on the table - but OTM calls are turning ITM stupid fast.
I did 3%. This is a very swingy stock. Once I see my order executed, I wait for the next buying opportunity which is almost always close. And then add another 3%. But if you wanna be a little less conservative (considering this b swings a lot), Id prolly do 5-10%.
So, as fast as priest blowing load in choir boy?
lol snooze u lose
Praying for you
You should be fine but why is everyone complaining its only like a 3% dip
He miss typed. He meant "buy more at 1pm"
profit taking for holiday
PLTR?
I have over 100 shares its just annoying seeing it constantly mentioned
Definitely.
Warrants are a better bet for profit potential but they dont have the safety net that shares do.   

Much more opportunity for profit though.
well it's been 10 minutes. PLTR has dropped $1
Its over son
Exactly
Exactly
I bought Feb calls after it jumped to $15 on nov 9 and they are up 690%.
Lmfao. The puts i have are both down over 10% pre market.
Lol what? Whos allowed to make that decision and why
yeah they banned the ticker because people didn't read the dd and got raped on Mondays hype
Encouraging perspective, thanks.
lol same.  Clown car
I'm here I'm a retard.
I missed it. It's 11.85 now.
I have mental issues c
Where does it say the companies in the article? Im missing it maybe? Which two companies?
IVR imo but mfa and the vanguard etf are also good
inverse yourself 

that is the true answer 

this sign is correct
Explain it to us then, oracle
I think it does though
And a scam is a scam
Gotcha. Almost got myself retarded for a moment.
What? That's a lie
I sold my final 3 1/15/21 20c that I bought early last week at around 0940 today, never traded over a holiday weekend with raging pandemic numbers and potential for shutdown panic,  no idea what the hell it will do from here, but here's hoping this bitch dips again so I can load up anew!
Jk lol
I gotta get better at reading the candles
Only have 100 shares though...
Source? 

ToS had nothing. FT and BBG had nothing. Googled it and saw no news. 

Its whatever. Maybe Ill sell some OTM covered weeklies.
Nevermind someone linked CNBC. Never checked that
Brilliant
Source?
Depends on the size of dip but yea 30c. If it goes below 25 then 25c.
Feelsbad man, which broker are you with?
Ill send them some nice uber eats
Logically i know its overdue for a pullback, but this meme really rocketed every day for 2 weeks
AT A LOSS 
papa elon didnt like that. also fuck you
Salty pump and dump bull mad at the red theme he's gonna see on robinhood today lol

don't worry boyo I can help you make back of those losses

*unzips dick*
Jokes on you, I had [calls this whole time](https://i.imgur.com/vtux4qI.jpg) 
yea like woa, just a stock and a play - its over, whistle blew. Face off on the next one and move on, enough time already on woulda coulda...

happy turkey day
Im not going to hop into a meme stock that everyone on here is in. When it drops hard half of you will lose entire accounts
You aren't the 1%, dumbass.
Triggered

just lost about 5k worth in options bc of the stupid day trade rule
Appreciate the honesty.
Ah I was thinking about that...good point. Suppose we'll see how today shakes out.
I see msft vibes in tsla price today from before the dotcom burst
Whats that?
So puts at 30$ got it
I like that answer
Lol facts
Yeah these type of women are IQ capped at 75. Not a long term investment more of a pump and dump
Lmao the puts on equities i am holding are both down 10%+ pre market
Keep fighting the good fight brother
This is the way.
lol
Not that weak shit, the EV shit.
I like your energy
Shitcoin trading, cash app, stonks go up, etc
Kinda literally.
Yeah, just trying to work out if this is a good buying opportunity or if there is some news that implies bigger trouble?
4 mins ago.
Smart
So save the big buys for Black Friday? 
modern journalism lmao
Yeah may open an RH account quick and buy a few of the $10 2023 ones and not check it til 2022.

I'm always tempted to overtrade leaps
I shut them down saying that I need to jump in another call ok bye
Then yolo your shit on tsla ao you can afford to see a therapist
Exactly if youre actually holding weekly calls youre dumb asf bc 1. Theta and 2. Theta. The only reason to ever buy a weekly is to offload the same day.
TSLA is 100% moon-bound, we all know it.

Just got a case of the sniffles this morning. May not moon this week, but it will moon again this year.
Right. The running joke here was _______ talks going well. Now it seems like its not much of a concern at all. Took one month
Couldnt agree more
Lol right? Automod big dumb
I bought puts at close yesterday lol wondering when to sell lmao

Made $2600 on stonks when it bottomed out. Good times. I think Im done for the week now before I lose anymore money.
she kinda fat tho
At this rate Ill have to refund the turkey for spam.
Aye good call lol
Yeah I closed the 20c pretty much at the top (150%) and if it dips again imma use the profits to put into  another few 30c
$220p 12/18 lol
PS5 Gang
Lol well I'd think a quick peep at the daily chart should have caused some concern regardless 
How did u pick that today ?
Cool, thanks.
Cool, thanks.
Cool, thanks.
Cool, thanks.
Cool, thanks.
Cool, thanks.
Cool, thanks.
I sold a call against my shares
18 Dec 20
Because it was undervalued at ipo and is a badass company
Poomp and 
Crsr is a good company that was and kind of is legit undervalued compared to its competitors
Initial purchase was sub $20, two more purchases low $20s, and one more purchase in $40s
Loading up on SQ and LUV when it takes a hit from the post-thanksgiving COVID surge
Definitely not. They're already getting deals ready to sell the vacc.
If volume doesnt keep sucking we hit price target of 11 easy
Weeeee!
dont know, i trimmed my position yesterday on SQ
Ummmm my whole portfolio is 11/27 550C, Im down 40% today
26.
Yes, Im retarded and big numbers trigger dopamine.
I'm in some short dated GME 11/27 $16.50 puts
Now number five
Mine expire in may
>  BLNK

It'll will go back to 30, no worries. High volume stocks flux a bit
When your grandmother hugs you
For everyone wondering what a gamma squeeze is:

If investors (like us WSB idiots) buy enough calls, they can trigger a Gamma squeeze. The option purchases force the dealers to buy the stock, which pushes the share price higher. As this happens, the dealers buying activity increases the Delta at a non-linear rate (gamma). In circular fashion dealers then must buy more of the stock, and on and on
So a straddle is essentially buying a put and a call simultaneously. The strategy is profitable only when the stock either rises or falls from the strike price by more than the total premium paid.
lol wife bro ive never seen a vagina
that's a good play, I'll check out the option prices. 
option prices are relatively high. I will buy
already got a bunch of this.
Why Nio over Xpeng?
pltr tho
Still have most of my portfolio in VOO, QQQ, and beetcorn because Im a queer

Looks like it. I'm out though. I'm not taking the chance. PLTR a company that hasn't made a profit in 16 years is worth 50 billion all of a sudden. TSLA half a trillion. People don't even know what they are buying anymore, it's pure greed.
He fuckin ded
He is rip
Hes dead
It happens. Todays been rough my guy
If theres like 70% more calls than puts I dont see how MMs can let them all go ITM
 ZM, T-H-C-B, CRSR, NIO.  Meme 10 index is very fluid lol.
better now?
$95 
Up 250% in 2 days. I'm not mad about it.
Tell me you bought back in...
Love me some SPAC.
I think
Hard to say what the net effect will be on any specific stonk, just a variable to consider in value assessment of holding.
Ok bet
There really is.
I bought 5 calls, so I don't have the capital (11k) too.
175%
you sell the contract itself
With my luck it'll crash if I jump in. I'll do everyone here a solid and let it ride
Just dont want any fellow retards bag holding when MMs take profits.
lmao I feel that king
Still holdin baby, balls be full
Haha I commented on the exact top gg
Hey I made good money on HYLN this last week. I dumped it
Lol fair enough
He tried to argue with me about momentum after it took a 15% dump
There's some actual clever people on there but most of them will probably just piss you off so it's up to you lol
No this assholes gonna be on addy staring at a non moving screen
 let the tards buy
Awwwww you must be one of those boomer stock boys huh? I pity you, seriously.
You're on a roll guy!
not big enough
Will know about their feelings at 4 pm. 
It was at 273 around 5am
T H C B is just so cheap right now at 11.00  
but mostly just scared for a drop of PLTR
Agreed. Im glad I bought big when I did.  I can easily see this breaking 30 once merger with BFLY comes through.
Crsr LI nio are the ones im worried about
You need a handle for a cup and handle.
Even if they had gone with

* SNE would have been up +20%
* Nevermind TSLA +38%

Both in my account, I cannot believe what shit they do. Don't even need to YOLO it.
Just send them an email to request info to manage my own funds.

This market is retarded, and would rather do a YOLO than expect to turn a slim profit when I am too old to remember.
Probably never. I hit my first 10 bagger with spy puts and I think Ill chase that high forever
1k actually!! For real though, I would have prepared better if I knew we would somehow be afloat this late in the day
BCHT
or you could just thc b
BCHT

I just got in. I wonder if bad move
It's 2020, man. He doesn't give a shit.
He was early but not wrong.
I bought calls early and later sold cc when the cost covered the original calls. Literally playing with free money right now.
its floor is also 13 dollars from here, have fun reeing on days like this
Nah. BLNK overbought.
9 out of 10 retards said no XOM last 2 weeks. I had 2 trades, both 500%.
Hey I rolled it forward
Must have not happened
F
I'm just gonna keep selling.  If I have to buy this stock for $20, I will do that until I'm broke.
Huh?! Maybe because stocks almost always see a correction after going parabolic
Argentinian...but yeah
10k in TSLA 300p September 2020 leggo
Just looks like it might be taking a breather.

Thats not a bad thing after this run.
Absolutely saw it and totally agree. Its deserved as well. Dont get me wrong Im bullish on this company, but the run up has been beyond stupid.
No Im not fucking joking dude. What part of going up 250% in a matter of weeks do you think is normal, even for a fucking awesome company? 

Im not a bear but my god there are SO many pigs out ready to get slaughtered....
...thank you
if it were official this wouldnt be a tip now would it.
We call this premarket
PINS gonna try out offering classes for their users via ZOOM
I dont care if you want it. Im up 63% on CNK stock and made about 2 grand flipping options on that and AMC.
LMAO my FDs months ago
Peoples expectations are pretty crazy 
For its share price theyre pretty good. Two weeks out could get $100 premium and if you can afford multiple 100 share batches that shit adds up quickly
Wasn't china this time, this was India.
Not for mee when its nose diving like this
Sorry to hear. Yea we've pretty much bottomed out. Unless we get a spike from more shutdowns I don't see it mattering much to the market. It would have to be nail in the coffin as a catalyst for a horrible week to matter I think.

Just wondering if I should buy some stocks. Wont mess around with options because the volume on NVAX options arent that good
Bro I lost 40% selling gld put spreads is this a reference to that or are you legit calling this company gold??
I traded 6 months pants-on.  Didnt make a dime.  Couldnt figure it out.  If I cant win, and Im wearing pants .
Still havent found all the tickers I want on my watchlist like $VIX futures or an /ES that I dont have to go update (currently have /ESZ20 on my watchlist).
Leaps on SQQQ? Full retard.
Shares...

But going to $80 soon
Hasnt been a lot of talk about thicc boi
Thanks!
Thanks for the advice
Ill go with the regret later category
Man anything good really, there will be blood is prob fav movie and love Simpsons lol thats the base
Honestly I got out at this point, up 40% and it was my entire portfolio so Im good to go cash gang. Wishing I got in on PLTR but that ship has probably sailed
Yeah, good gamble or nah?
I know. Let a man dream.
Are you sure? If I buy, it's gonna go down.
It's going go down with me if I get in.
It's gonna go down with me. You wanna watch it?
$40 12/31
Got it thanks
Oh Im quite happy with it. Its how I diversified 
Oh I didnt even notice, I just need one green thing a day. PLTR gave me that 
What about Amazon calls then?
God I hope it makes it back up today
Retarded for believing this
Why is Everyone selling
Yeah they will beat earnings bigly. Hope the stock goes up
Yeah that shit is retarded. Looking worse than SPY/QQQ in early September
Bad
Fuck, I got 11/27 calls, guess im fucked.
fuck you mf we mooned $2 when we were down $2 in PM. if you think its not gonna dump down to atleast 24.5 ur delusional
You rang 
This so much. Ill buy a bit here and there but AAPL hasnt been exciting since Steve Jobs.

Whatever happened to that dude...

MSFT though. Thats a company I load up on every fucking dip. I only have equity and its still been a massive ROI. Could see them being up there with our GOOGs and our AMZNs in a few years.
This is always the correct answer
It meant vix was probably going to rise a small bit in the super near term
PLTR. Should be plenty of action. I think RH might be lying on the bid/ ask.
What?
I paperhanded it at $46 during this dip. 

Might buy more. Waiting to see how low it gets
Roger that, all I heard is buy pltr calls now.
Yes history probably will repeat itself, but you can get in and out and grab that dividend.
It technically has boomed, but has much more room to grow. Idk why theyre classified as a weed stock, but their technology basically allows for internal agriculture thats self sustainable. Its a super cool new tech
Yes daddy and I want to touch you with my penis
I would love that
Huh?
positions and Im in homie
im diamond handing these
Why are we so sure about 300? Getting locked out of a market as big as India is no joke, and what if ANT can't come up with the capital to run like a bank, or at least can't do so profitably? Not saying BABA is gonna tank, but what if 285/290 is pretty much a fair value?
Feeling some 4.5c and 5c personally
IV too high imo
Look up their relationship with clover health, why they are mooning today
Its like half what is was pre covid
Lol I feel u but its a sleeper this week it made hella $ for some call holders I seen on an unusual option page I follow
Which ones then retard?
What dip its green lol
Everything?
I don't know what any of that means
Yessir
I have a 50 on 12/18 that is up 40pc =) also have 2 60s on that date for s&g
Have to assume someone is going to announce a lockdown of schools somewhere
It hurts to even refresh and see the ask now. Fuck me. Back to shitty desk work now.
The people need to know!
bought GOLD, GFI, KGC and FNV

gonna hold for years probably

coz when fed and ecb start printing again and US does fiscal stimulus then gold will probably go to $2.5-3k and with such high prices gold miners will become free cash flow machines. Could easily 3x/4x from these levels in next few years.

KGC is trading at 6 PE ratio, unbelievable bargain.
What ticker
DONE I just needed confirmation from WSB
K
What were your dates on the first calls?
nice
Like Jan call 3 weeks ago, dec call last fri
Thats it ?
Classic boomer reaction
Does that mean no student loan debt cancellation for cornpop?
Its today?
Yessir I sold my calls for a 5% gain cause Im a paper handed bitch but Ill be back to buy in next week. Im trying to enjoy my weekend with family this weekend lmao

$1.50 per share dividend.
Grab the dividend and dip out before the payout date. You'll be paid as long as you buy today and are a shareholder of record on Nov. 30.
Oh sweet so i make extra profit? Because one is worthless at expiry?
Lmfao why 600 the deal aint even gon happen anytime soon
ok thanks that makes sense.
yes will dump on the SP/banks etc, but cyclicals/sector stocks will do well
You would sell shares at profit now?
Im in at 13, would u recommend selling my shares now ?
I went 55c gonna blow past 50
I bought shares at $9 in October and sold at $13 thinking it wasnt going much higher lol. Quite the dumbass I am
If he can unload them before the IV crush; maybe.
Placed a small $ZM short
Yea I saw that. Why such an impact on the share price ?
Ya trying to hold myself back

I thought that won't be a direct listing. Instead GS is issuing it
I see. Was unaware of WORK news.
The .70 spread on my 12/18 103c is annoying AF.
"seLloFf" lmaaaaaaaaaaooooo
Awesome that's what I was thinking. Thanks so much.
Just waiting for a dip that's the plan
Sneed's Greed and Feed
Yup
If you read the articles it says CRM is valuing WORK at $17 Billion.  It spiked to over 20B.
I've done mostly calls, but picking shitty ones with way too high IV.
Good call, wasnt sure if the shortened day would account for any fuckery
I know. but i think it won't stick.
Im using Schwab
But WORK 12/4 as a limit order at $3 while it had that bid/ask. Order got filled. Now have it as a sell limit of $4 for a quick 33% gain. Someone buy it. Daddy needs a new PS5.
Allens.

holding bro fuck this
o shit o fuck
Bought it yesterday before close, it looked really good at the time!
Well gap is down 20% after earnings. JWN is still more than of what it was precovid
I think Im gonna look to get out as soon as my 1/15 20c gets ITM
https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/
Everything
Best of luck. I'm thinking about rolling into them for puts too. Their whole business approach has been "It's not as bad as everyone thinks" and "Talks going very well"
Lol C'mon bro
Limit Order okay perfect
Limit or stop limit?
im pretty fucking stupid so whatever I guess either inverse will happen or itll not move at all and ill get IV crushed
First Google search I look at puts xpev's price target at a median of 308.28 for Dec 2021. Seems like investors are really bullish on it, but today's been blood red
A hedge fund manager already announced theyre going to shit a couple days ago and it dropped 8%. Yesterday was shit for penumbra too. But its cuz one of their main products is supposed to help people with health problems, has caused injuries and deaths. There going to be dealing with a lot of legal troubles soon. There was a dd about it the other day too
Yep...sold for 55%.quick 5000 dollars
Hmmm i might still just have kangaroo ptsd
Yeah Im thinking about exiting at some pout today and taking what i got.
Gotcha. Thanks
PLTR puts expiring next week got it
I know how does that work cause all my trades are within 30 days for the most part
RemindMe! 3 hours
Black and white stinky pig yes
Didnt even notice i put the wrong ticker lol

Gracias
It was a hedge, the only problem is I bought them right before IWM took fucking steroids and ran up 4%.
Taking my tendies to roblox
Yeah but theres bound to be a pullback, no?
actually factual, might just get the long call and call it a day
Yeah its my favorite. I have a bottle of the 21 year. Havent tried the regular
I mean can I still sell Friday if it expires that day?
Please explain lol
I dont know why people keep thinking a movement or postpone of one  NFL game will hurt the stock. Seasons not gonna get canceled.

But losing that game Thursday night is a tough loss for the league and tv
DIX kinda average for the year rn but on an uptrend
$30?
SQ $205, PLTR $20
Thanks for the reply. Others have said the same, hoping to crack 30 or get close at least. Hard to see this stock tanking at this point. Maybe a short sell but I think it would bounce back strong
Thanks for the advice man. I really think we can crack 30 EOW
Thanks for the reply. You're right 25 is looking pretty good at the moment. Just being paranoid
Yeah that makes sense. This is literally my first option purchase so I don't wanna get too complicated for my smooth brain to handle lol. Maybe just a stop loss to make sure gains are secured. Thanks for the reply btw
I meant in terms of strike price and expiry
Nio got volume tho
I love my PLTR I just hope I had doubled my stack when I pulled the trigger a few weeks ago

are you saying it's being run by homophobic people? all of us are in danger then!
Reddit is a liberal cesspool. The only subs worth while are WSB and all the ones with naked thots.
Got banned from the politics subreddit for telling a troll to "go back in your hole." Asked the mod why the ban was permanent and got the response "appeal denied' as if they were a judge. Talk about gay mods!
the UK economy is ass I didnt realise how low wages are here for most people until I saw avg people here making triple what an avg person makes in the UK
Based and  pilled
This is the way
Lol
his phone was upside down
Zoomers moves in hoards. Pushing up price.
Exactly.
Bought at 0.15. Up 100% yesterday. The open should be interesting.
I bought in last week so whatever. PLTR to $30 next week!
imma buy again
doubling down on my positions is usually a sure fire sign of my undoing.
Its still a call right, doesnt make us 
Been leading the market the past few weeks,
May be a sign (Im a gay bear)
100%

After 100% runups over the month for some of these stocks. XPEV could go to $50 and be up on the 1 week timeframs
Not EV but cool company.  Surprised it mooned after it was beat up as a SPAC.
You know it. It is Gyna after all.
The manipulation is hysterical. Investigation into projects related to Evergrande and Shenzhen.
should i buy both stocks?
Loool okay it makes sense now
fly like a  
the only upside to that name is that it would make for some good wordplay since it sounds like "fister" which is funny to me
No you cant lol
Yeah as a regular person I say f AMZN but as a WSB autist Im just try to pay for school and rent so I want it to see $4500 

It's definitely profit taking, was up 40% in like 7 days lol
I'm just scared to shits, have too much riding on it right now
I dont think it will go back below 24.
I made some reaalllyyy stupid trades looking back... and thankfully have learned how to do basic TA, was for sure just blindly hitting buy at the beginning...
Maybe but Jan 15 are the money.
Yes just play them close. Take profit if you have to.
NIO?
Just spoke to my wealth management advisor yesterday and he put me onto ESRT. Long term play but at $10/share, I thought it worth 2k. He also likes MRVL for 5G exposure.
Christ...
my bad. Not refreshing hard enough.
Thanks man, I'll try smiling it is really hard knowing what $2.6M can do, it is life changing and i am really feeling terrible. I'm ready to lose the 10K back then OK the options too... I feel like today is the worst day of my life, but at least I didn't lose 10K
This. Bro you can always regret the could have beens, but theres literally dozens of those same scenarios every week, you just dont realise or think about it. Dont sweat this. $10k is awesome! Go treat yourself on something you really want.
Appreciate it man.

I am really in agony looking at the call prices, and I swear in the name of God I am willing to YOLO on my first options then... I truly believe in it. I may never get the chance again and I think I will quit the stock market and put into ETF. Overall I'm still down but the thought of the price rising so fast is truly driving me insane.

How do you control yourself from such thoughts if I may ask. I made money off PLTR, have deleted RobinHood and still feeling suicidal.
I don't think I ever felt that confident on a Call in my life before. Yet I didn't... I don't think an opportunity like that exists again. I've deleted the app. I need a break from this
Thanks man. I dont think I will get another opportunity like this again. It is the first time I truly believe in it. It is driving me insane that I withdrew all profits and deleted RobinHood, but still feel like killing myself. The price rising so fast is too toxic for me to handle... I might need some time off trading
It says $22
Like what ?
31.50
I'm aware
Your never buying then
Do you think it will plunge that low?
There was one pinned to the top of WSB for about 5 minutes
What time Friday
Is IBKR any good for options? Never used it or heard of it (true retard).
No, I would buy 12/4 $50 calls if it hits 47.50 at open and bounces off the bottom of the channel.

Economic reports every week numbnutz 

With next two days being holiday, its triple the normal report
I think the last one dropped a pallet of cash on Irans doorstep.
I think it will be flatlined and boring

But who knows
Had 50 TSLA 500 12/4P lost 2K by selling right before close.  My guess is they open around 7-8$ which would have been a 10K win
Been bagholding this trash for a long time lol
Lol XPEV too
He should be fine, the juice will be high
calls unfortunately
feels bad man
shhh.
Ah on this probably explains it
Im holding THC+B then, aint letting yall go to the moon without me

yeah but it took 1 week of flatness before something happened
vxx is currently tracking Santee Claus on its radar.
apologies, youre right.
It is a beast 
Short squeeze happening and retards on here stay silent lol
Didn't know NBAC is a doctor
Lucky guy.
Yes its very volatile.
Im not saying there isnt upside, but if your expiration is 11/27 go ahead an realize some gains.
What strike?
When did you buy this?
11/27 25c
It's up 2 since I bought in, and doesn't look like it'll slow down.
I'm apparently not going to get them for $3.
lower ur strike price
Been burned so many times on GME, instincts are telling me no lol, granted them going up makes complete sense, it also did every other time I positioned in.
PLTR
Theres currently 5k open interest. You think I should sell and roll? I forgot about needing to sell it to someone at some point lmao blind sided by the gains
I already got PLTR shares lol up 60%
Circuit breaker retard, itll be up soon
Now its trading again and jumped another 10%
My cost is 20$ so def dont need to
Its going to 50$
Nah dude it was halted. I just placed an order of 1k shares that filled at 33 then sold at 38
Got halted too.

Sorry though
$300
Nah the wide use is each 100% = bag 

Thats why 1000% returns are called 10 baggers and not 11 baggers..
It's a joke bro
leaning towards this - have bought back calls I've sold  in the past only for it to burn me.
my bad - 11/27
I know. Just trying to lie to myself.
Its the cheapest EV on sale, people still drive Fiat, Mini, and Smart cars right?
ITS SMILING BACK AT ME 
I got spooked last night looking at the massive divergence of S&P and the DIX... I was expecting some sort of crash so I cashed out most of my positions... it looked eerily similar to March, September and October crashes. guess well have to wait and see. VIX was also up but down now again. What do you think?
Oh and just to add.. one of the positions was PLTR is almost at 15% now 

I sold this morning thinking to buy in again when it drops a little more. Now it's up.
Bruh imagine how much fuel our invisible yachts use vs a tractor
Sold to go all in on another play where Ive gotten 100% return so far. But Id be up closer to 1000% if I stayed in PLTR
They are worth a lot more now
i only fuck with memes and momentum shitters now 

it's superior to boomer bullshit investing 101
All of them - especially PLTR. Fuckin mooning.
yea i forget
Yes, please do.  I can't remember

Fair enough. I guess I'm a little excited.
Ive never been so Thankful 
I NEED MORE CHOICES. I got in at a decent time, but Im too poor to buy the calls now 
Any options on PLTR are betting on it continuing this growth.

Yes, IV crush would suck.. but how could that happen without

A- the stock not moving and ruining our positions anyway
B- the stock dropping

in either cash, IV crush is not the issue here. IV Crush has to be after the uncertainty is settled. What would be that catalyst here other than trading sideways or a drop?
Dawg you don't have 100 shares?
Got filled at .63

Already at .55

This is the way
Theres going to be a major pull back when the investigation finds its a scam. Itll probably be delisted. Good luck!
CRSR has absolute retard strength!!!! Im getting in again that still has room to grow !
Nah broski I'm a Boomer. We stay winning
Yeah its investing at this point PLTR
who cares about those poors? pls tell them to fix the SPY WIFI connection to tendie town
So just like every other Chinese ticker everyone mentions, got it
I actually made $875. I sold yesterday at $23 anticipating a dip.
Go search up PLTR IV. Its really been crushed since it hit the 20s (thats why you see so much volatility in the 20s compared to the teens). (IV = index volatility)
go read the news. Cramer talked a lot of shit about Palantir
As a matter of fact, I am. I work for an EV.
Chasers always get BTFO eventually. PLTR daily RSI is 86. CRSR was 91 yesterday, look at what happened today
Im coming back in at 26-27 its going to pull back 10% just like yesterday. Watch

Yesterdays low.... which was 13% below yesterdays close. Lmao
He sold the put. He wasn't betting against it. Retard
swissquote
i can't link the retail pool. but it's still pretty low volume [source](https://fintel.io/sob/us/crsr)
When the hammer drops at 1:30, come back to me.
Yeah, I've had it since Monday.. nice to have one you can count on.
500 and any time I'd dips below 11 I will add 100
Yeah. Why in mid December. Gut feeling or anything special.
Would of wished it's 420%
or maybe you are right, lol

Doesnt sound too shabby. Bought some $118 calls. Thanks
If they are FDs expiring this week, those aren't going to print but we'd need to get a big drop from here
Because I would have almost tripled my money in less than a week and could deploy that capital to other areas.
Lately fast food and beer. YUM, SBUX, TAP,  STZ
GE calls in the afternoon when it takes it's boomer, sell around 10 am next day, rinse and repeat.
yeah ICLN has been printing for me as ive been averaging down
My luck 
thx bby for the good advice i stayed 
don't be mad cause I'm doin me better than you doin you ;)
Done, thank you friends. Thinking about moving that money into GE (General Electric)
Not Harris 
You think just because hes old he doesnt smoke some!?! Why do you think they call him sleepy Joe
Please god no
TL;DR olds starting to own shitcoin.  Look out below.
Get gud
:/
I know but still. Surely there are other tech focused SPACs that could have went with
No I bought at the literal peak just below $25 and am deeply red help
My bad way less lol. 1k
its just how he rolls I guess
That was a wild ride. Got in at 8.8, went deep into the 6s.. sold for 9.. its prob going to go up but I was stressed.
WhAt A ShITtY StONk! I kNeW iT wAs ShiT  


lol
It'll close down 8 but ok
Very smart man
But that insider selling bro
This, buy puts
What about a week
gay
puts on my life
lol dude, laughed so hard
Looks like it I sold my pltr at the high a bit after open. Guess I could of squeezed out some more from it
Im saying we dipped because other people did that, not that you should have done that


Its an explanation for the dip not a suggestion of what you should have done you fucking toddler
[deleted]
11
Yeah I dont really smoke weed. But I can fuck on stimulants easy. Like i take vyvanse and have 0 issues laying pipe.
I can fuck on stimulants easy, weed no.
It got banned
GG to your calls lol
Bitch, I can wait.  
Aint no pussy ass dip gonna scare me.
I was just wondering. When I joined wsb in 2018 it was the norm to spell it that way.
Im literally down 0.2% on meme stocks, we aint friggin leaving
You guys crack me up this sub is shit lmao
Hes not selling fear. Hes selling puts!
Buy campbell's stock?
This is the way
I felt I would get more eyes here. Nobody on investing or stocks is worth a damn
You have the balls I wish to someday grow
I already did, they are a bunch of turds.  No replies at all in 2 days.
CRSR fundamentals are great, but its starting to get stretched out at these valuations. 5x multiple on low margin hardware sales is a lot to sustain. Not saying it wont go higher. I just see way more upside in GME over the short/medium term. GME 5x rev than CRSR with 0.15x multiple. About to rerate higher thanks to e-commerce and potential tender offer on table in short term with short squeeze.
[deleted]
Actually about 3% overnight. Now run along and go chase NIO and PLTR.
Trish Stratus
And dont buy fucking weeklies unless you plan to get out in a day.
Why
 Lmao Ill try
I thought their website was nice?
That was my thought. Going to watch IV
35. Went full retard on this one
Yep, more room to grow with Thicc B
So yes
Yes! I really hope it does
That propulsion started on 10/19 and continued 11/10 lol i want to get in on a good sale.
THANK YOU SO MUCH IM ALREADY UP 1K+
I am in fact up 2k already, also bought 7 25c fds that are now up 80%
Yea that's on me..... I should have kept my mouth shut. :(
Yeah, but what's causing it to go down? I may be wrong, but I thought because it's an index the price is dependent on the price of its underlying assets.
did not sell, staring down even larger losses now. man I love WSB
I got shares in CRSR and PLTR only. Im planning on putting more in PLTR but I should do it instantly because its going high.
How much u want to bet me that TSLA wont fall below $500 on this bullshit news, they will buy at the peak, or is the market that manipulated?
oh i forget football is a thing
I thought credit karma is merging with intuit. Are they affiliated with SQ?
Thanks that is how I read it but wanted a second opinion.
I would but I heard they are at the drum circle with Donny, sleepy, Elon and the cat
Nope
I bought more in around 24.50. Its at $25.50 should I do buy in now?
I don't trust BABA after it hurt me 
Well that's a lot less work we oughtta give it a try!
Yup sold about half
Good thanks
Thanks 
started from 0$ in jan 2019. im a kid and even paid my own rent and car and shit.
They make semiconductors for pretty much every tech industry and do a lot for car navigation and displays. My calls are up 25% that I bought on Monday
590 610, got stopped out of 580
I missed out on that dip earlier today
That's a weird way to spell no
Daily action.
And crm doesnt have enough money to cover it...?
Ok
This is my 401k
A lot of people here lost a lot of money on ROKU, FUBO is in the same sector
Gonna have to  
Also it's CIIG
Yeah, I was looking at it yesterday and hoping for a pullback. Instead it jumped 25%.
Damn have yall given up on 29
hold me
Yea
UVXY 12c 12/18
UVXY brother
Lol
Learn how to do math
I'd say buy it before the ticker switch if you think owning a pure play igaming company with built in brand name recognition sounds like a good idea to you. Everyone goes gaga for sports betting while not realizing table games and such are about 7x more valuable and more states are opening up.
Was doing a social experiment.  Seems like i got downvotes regardless.
I like to inverse WSB
Sure in 2023 maybe. See ya at $20 first

Hedge funds are shilling this here to dump bags on y'all. Just don't be the one holding it
No, it just closes early
Oof
Read the link: (SPOCS are OVERVALUED): https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/24/why-blink-charging-stock-just-crashed-12/
I dunno, half this sub was saying it never turned a profit and was gonna pull back to 16 just last week. But, that is wsb
Exactly why people shouldnt sell on a Green Day lol.
You should hold
Ok u convinced me Im back in fuck
hahahahha fuk
you will know when you grow up son.
What you saying?
True which is why I mostly stayed on the sidelines on those til XPEV's 30% day. Did lose a little on 0DTE's last Friday tho
I think he's just legit dumb. Look at his comment history, he thought it would test $13 Monday and drill all week. Not trolling at this point.
Ark bought 4.5 million shares in October

Markets closed tomorrow
He bought at the high probably.
Some of us fomoed at the tippy top
Ive never understood the strategy of sell high and buy higher
Overall market is going to drag. You'll see. I'm on the sell side. Access to institutional money and their plays. The sell of strength in this market is unreal.

If you're not in a meme stock, you're completely fucked if you're long anything
Yes and no. Made 150% on my $10c calls but sold them on 11/3 in advance of the election results. I would have went 1500% instead if I held through to $18/19 last week
I'm not even shorting this shit hole just tired of it
Whens thar
when and what is NIO day?
Is this because of holidays. Do you think it will go up later or next week?
That news is nothing. Only 9k cars and not a serious defect
You'll learn you should have doubled down 
i dont mess with little 20 dollar stocks. i also dont trade stocks.
Loaded 6.6k of warrants
-15% is not a general sell off
Yea I got like four shares of NIO but bought a huge chunk of my
$ in LInand now Im down so much Im hoping for one more run. Wish I put everything into PLTR on Friday like my gut told me
Itll go up Monday, there are 12000 $55 11/27 calls on NIO. MMs said no.
Why would it go to 570 deal wont happen anytime soon
I do yea. Sold my calls this morning like a  but now loading up on puts. Its just speculation right now I got some $37 12-18 and Im up 50 a contract
Cant spell trader without it 
The fact that this autist makes money makes me happy
a 50% increase in 5 months. Basically guaranteed thanks to government backing.

But yeah, I can see why people would rather stick with yolos like PLTR.
Personally, Im playing both this and PLTR.
I mean, whatever.  
I thought I'd throw this up in case people were interested.  


But I guess a 50% gain over 5 months is nothing compared to PLTR's 10-20% a day.      
I just bought in
What percentage are you thinking I just googled it
WELL fuck you very much sir. I made 30k friday. 35k Monday. 20k yesterday... so an idiot? perhaps. But a wealthy idiot. Idiot.
Shit! I'm in the UK! totally forgot about your mad day of taking land and killing people then declaring thanks for said slaughter and land grab...
Sorry you held your calls
Why 
Someone was talking about this. What's a lockup
25c 12/31
Salty bull mad at losing tendies lol, we should ban that pump and dump stock ticker from being mentioned  instead
Are you new? Those of us who bought that dip do something called taking profits while you try to time the rug pull perfectly. Good luck. If youre buying now and havent already made out, youre a guppy, not me.
Yep, gotten shittier and shittier lately
Haha I have ban flair how would I be new!? 

Holding Tesla since $100
If everyone's talking about it, it's a sure thing.
[deleted]
No its not, sorry to get your hopes up bro
I cant believe today. This is fucking incredible
lol salty much?
got him there
This made me tear up its the most beautiful response and best mindset
Down $10k but I got PLTR which is saving me from the amount of pain I expected. Thinking of buying more XPEV
What a cuck. It's my money and I will light it on fire in any manner I see fit.
Yup you're boned. And not in the fun way. 

For the ones that don't know you have no right to privacy on any device owned by your employer. They can and will check browsing history and anything else they feel like.
Agreed on everything you just said. I personally really like XPEV - possibly more than NIO. The main difference between the two is that XPENG has its own factories and is backed by BABA, but launched later than NIO, so currently ships fewer cars. Check out the XPENG factory overview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxS1rX1BXlk

XPENG is also going head to head with Tesla models and competing on price, whereas NIO is looking more at the higher end of the market. I don't know which will be the dominant player long term (perhaps neither), but XPENG's foundation is certainly solid.
In your sleep Cia implants tracking device in your butt.
It's market cap based
I own it but still have no idea what kinda Skynet shit they get up to.
no i big bull short term but long term its not a good hold
Not really a joke but yeah youre right. Its just 2020 has fucked me in every aspect of my life and Im tired. Congrats on finishing your degree and Ill keep my head up like you are. Thanks man
Already getting bought up
Unsure if I should buy TSLA or buy a Tesla
Not really, realistically if there is a selloff then I'll notice before it drops like ten dollars (at which point I'd still be green), and could sell.

I'll take that risk, and could also set a minimum price so if it dips to like 22 it'll trigger a sell
Surprisingly Im too much of an idiot to buy calls, and its been ripping too hard for me to wanna risk it yet, but Im up $600+ on just holding 100 shares
Had like 30 shares at IPO and bought another 70 around $23
I got creamed back in June, so Im taking big profit where I can.
beautiful :')
Id like a 30 EOD, but I have patience
But at least you have PLTR calls, wide choice
you should move out and keep her isololated for 2 more months until the vaccine is out in force

go rent some place for 2 months because you know you are not isolating well enough to keep a 1nm virus from getting to you then her
Dow 40k confirmed. 
He's not tweeting this morning so he's happy with this red
He's a cock sucker he was losing his mind yesterday. Can't believe paper hands follow his ass
25 is your collateral.

Unless PLTR hits 29 by 11/27 COTD, I collect the premiums.

Aka poor mans covereee calls.

Buy ITM/ATM calls, sell OTM  to collect freemium.
Im a noob too, all I know is PLTR or death.
MMs not wanting to lose on 70% of the options they sold
go4it!
69% of the time, it works every time.
Too small a MC? Lol wow. If 400 million is small I feel bad for my gfs bf...
GL out there today
Gotcha. I was just worried about an Uber situation where they price way too high at IPO
 I'm in Canada so dunno if taxes work the same way  also im a student so im in like the lowest tax bracket lol
Most wont understand this company. Have you seen there 1 hourish long video?
Just search Morgan Stanley pltr downgrade
30
Oh shit, you're right. Math is hard, bruh.
Yes, see SEC nothing to see here.
>Its gonna be Tesla level amazing for years to come. Youre set

Thank you Milord. In PLTR we trust
This is the way
Haha. I made an extra 12k this month. I am winning.
Yea I would be just graduating college and probably wouldnt even look for a job if it actually hit 200
Looks like that post is going to age nicely!
Damn, I watched it go up all week thinking that I was too late.
PLTR feeding me right now
Dont make me cum while Im at work
99.9% of people made NO money on PLTR. Your already on top baby, and you better pull my hair and slap my face while your up there
fast is relative. My calls expire in February so only slightly nervous
thanks even i don't know what you're saying, i assumed it was bad
Good shit! Haha amzn always makes me so nervous.
Dew it
Huh 
yeah seriously. can you just let me work 3 days a week instead for the same pay and ill give you the same productivity lol
What's your strategy?
Youll get a better later down the road king
Its all I fuckin read about in the daily threads and I still see the posts before theyre deleted
Fuck off pussy
Im annoyed that I fell for that shit
Exactly lmao 

Dont get me wrong, I have no issue with either of them having support behind them but the way people act as if theyre some rags to riches story is total horseshit. Its easy to put all your time and effort into something when you have parents who will prop you up if it fails
WSB
We all know those spreads wont come to life until the day of expiration anyways (if theyre close to ITM)
Hold the line, but don't be afraid to cut losses if things get shaky.  Don't go against the trend... Manage your risk. it's been up, but shit can change quickly.

  
Better yet; Do fucking nothing for a month. Most of the money i've made on TSLA was from deleting the app and living my life.
Must be a rogue my titan olympic was only 99$
Like dude...SHUT THE FUCK UP.
90%
Oh I know, Ive been clean since February
I never knew how rough the shelf life stuff was until I lived alone during an internship. Lbs of strawberries are fantastic, too bad theyre out of season right now. Try a bunch of different kinds of apples if you can, I know a lot of people that think they dont like apples too much because they just eat red delicious, Granny Smith, or Fuji. Try pink lady, ambrosia, and honey crisp if you want to mix it up from berries.

Good on you for sticking with it man, good luck.
Hey I picked up some 12/31 30c good deal.
Based
PUMP UP THE JAM PUMP IT UP
Dont lie to me bitch
Were you just day trading this and got lucky from the buyout talks? Massive congrats to you dude
How much did those 5 cost?
So you can still buy the options if the stock is halted? Or did you buy the option right when it got unhalted?
so blnk was the star, thic boy next
If youve got weekly calls, then Id consider it. If youve got shit further out, you fucking hold that
Im here with my measly 50 shares 
Nice how much did you put in initially?
well its true :)
ain't gonna lie it's got retard strength but this might be the end of the line.. at least for pre thanksgiving.. what you got
I think it's normal to feel something, just try to keep your head up and surround yourself with positive people if you have any. Otherwise it's not stupid to pay to talk to a therapist just about whatever like actual stressed out floor traders do.
That fucked up man, take a little camping trip a few hours outside of town next time you have a little time. You always have friends here.

Also take it easy on the alcohol, shit is poison.
yeah enjoy ur 200k cases a day boi cya in lockdown soon 2
I'm sure the NIO and XPEV bags will feel particularly heavy today, but you paid the time premium for days like this, right?
Well, it just made sense.  
All the work/school/stay-at-home stocks in PM were up, and CHGG was at 0.00% at open, after a -3.5% day yesterday.
Hahahahhahahhahahah
that news was already announced yesterday about India, I think its overall the entire market being down thats keeping baba at these levels, plus Xi is hanging out with Biden today so that should be good for us
i bought yesterday too, all im sayin is u cant expect gains when u come in *after* a 40% run up. wait for a correction.
Lets hope youre right.
Why tf the market closed on a Thursday
Still higher than PLTR overall.
Enjoy your tendies sir. Well deserved.
What a great recommendation, thank you! 

What happens when my "what if" scenario makes me a ton of fake cash and I miss out on it? Haha!
Boo!
good man haha just smoked some good stuff watching the PLTR ticker moon
If he plans on holding till mid December, he'll be  *Snorting Cocaine* Off Of *Hookers* Ass  for Christmas
Nah havent checked. Have positions in gold and tesla
Interactive brokers has been reviewing my application for weeks now wont open the account, they seem shit
Cheers, will take a look
Yes lol let's not pretend like this shit isn't going back up next week
Lol you can assume they all cooked the books. Its Chinese, nobody is playing fair. It will moon if they hid it well enough.
Yes, but have you ever yolod your entire savings into nkla calls while on meth?
You are not alone
Im Chinese and what is this overly prioritizing home grown shit ur talking about? Lawl
I could agree, pretty bullish on each of those as well. TSLA is still overvalued but Im not gonna fight it lol
nice number
PLTR 40c 2/19. There. Then sell when you're up sometime in January.
I like your style.
Although it was a joke,vim sure that's the pest play if you want to sell premium with it. I mean you could do a covered call. But imo, tsla to risky to do anything other than buy calls or debit Spread (if your poor like me)
This is the way
Shares are safer. By a lot. This massive dip made me very skeptical. Im holding my one contract and will still probably go green on it but shares if you wanna play safe
its not spac, could theoritcally shit
I bought 30c 11/27 

dont judge they were 50$
I originally wanted 1000 shares and 20 calls.

&#x200B;

I halved those numbers and laid some bullets aside in case it dipped. Wish I had gone with the original play but I can't complain too much :)
Just get shares if youre wary
Lmfao nice.
There is only PLTR now my son.
Yea I think itll continue to do well with Joey B. In office and potential legalization in Mexico happening.
lol, I know! To think I wasnt being aggressive enough of all things.
My current car is a 10 year old second hand Subaru Forrester. This is going to be my first new car, and the most expensive thing I ever bought myself (or anyone). And its all cause I listen to you magnificent retards! TY
Hmm, bullish me says yes, bearish me says its possible we have slower growth after this. Overall, yes youre good
Damn that sucks friend. I was just trying to make a lame LOTR pun. Hope you're doing better though.
All in my dude. All in
Thats what they said about PLTR
Any chance Biden doesnt renew cause of ICE controversies
I mean COVID isn't going away for at least another 6 months
I'll make 2k which I will happily take. I should've held when it was $18 last week. Paper hands.
Ehh made some money at least
This really is up there with the most retarded thing Ive read on here dude. Think about it. Youre gonna get rekt. Take care man..
Omg so sorry. Hes actually retarded. Poor thing.
Its certainly possible. In my view, Tesla was unique because of its self driving focus and early jump on battery tech. That is what makes it valuable, it does something (self driving) better than anyone else has done. The other EV start ups are solely producers. What can they do differently than anyone else? You could argue that they are lean and therefore can produce a vehicle cheaper, but they are also competing with economies of scale with the larger boys. 
I also think its true that people are more willing to buy from new start ups for smaller purchases. I think people hesitate a lot more buying a 30-50k vehicle from an unestablished brand that might go bankrupt at any point. Also the established brands have hard earned reliability and warranty reputations and that isnt built over night.
There is also the issue of repairs. Big auto is so entrenched in the parts market that you can go to pretty much any mechanic and have parts ordered and they know how to fix your vehicle. These start ups would likely require you going in house for repairs.
At least Im up 30k over last week lmao
I honestly believe one of the biggest things college teaches you/employers look for is that a degree shows people you can put up with bullshit for long periods of time. Not many people can.
Completely agree, that's why I added in the part about going to a decent sized city or port. If you're out in a small town, like any trade there's going to be a lower average ceiling. I played wow with a guy who was 1st class in nowherevilletown Tennessee making 14/hr. He was quite proud of it as well. Blew my mind. The yard i work at now starts helpers out at 18.30, 1st class is 32.10. We're mid range for the area.
Jokes on you, I had [calls this whole time](https://i.imgur.com/vtux4qI.jpg)

Yeah, should have averaged down when AAPL dipped under 110.

I will tell you a story though - I had some leaps on apple that I bought in January for around $450 a contract. When March crash came, they were basically worthless.  

I was so scared they'd never recover I didn't have the courage to very aggresively average down.  Which I could and should have...I could have bought 20 contracts at a nickel a piece or so.  

&#x200B;

Well, when we recovered and they got back to close to breakeven, I dumped them. Back in late March early April people were adamant that Apple was fucked for the long term due to Covid and other factors.  

Then you know what happened. Apple went on a long tear and those leaps I had sold for a slight loss turned out to be worth near 10 baggers.  

So don't lose faith. The longer Apple is flat the more likely it busts out parabolically at some point.
Can you please explain to me why I should trust you fellow autist 

I want to trust you, I do not know Jack shit about this company I am just trying to make some tendies
Literally, they have to understand that we are fuking trying to do something in this freaking casino, so we can have better future!

Just give me a brake! I got you my guy, same shiet for almost 2 y
Just search wsb for "GME" or "Short Squeeze" or "big dick energy" or maybe "fuck hedgies get tendies"
Thats cool Im good with a meager 250% gain
Amazing
I bought a 22c on Monday expiring Friday for $38, sold yesterday for $175. Looks like its worth about $390 now.
Thank you
Then let it ride
Yea hold through
Youre locked from day trading - not trading overall
Sold.
Thanks for the reaffirmation man.
Thanks!
Sick! How much $ you in for? Im at 200% lol
stop youre gonna make me cum
Still man, you guys are underappreciated and underpaid for the work you do. After one of my family members was saved by an EMT, I had a whole other appreciation for them.
>If I buy FDs

You just listed your own solution
Basically
#nice
Well it absolutely can after the merger (to be exact the last date you can redeem for NAV, shortly before the merger). Look at FSR, briefly dipped below $10 after the floor was gone. SPCE dipped to 6 or 7 or so after merger.

But right now, if it does that, free money should it be below $10. Because then its arbitrage, buy now redeem later for $10.
If the merger fails you get $10/share.
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

Ok so you didnt say it was up 14% with 4 hours left.
Lol, yeah dont think PLTR is gonna drop cheaper than my current avg/cost. 
Crabtastic 
Sounds like Newegg. So prolly overvalued now
I wouldnt be either i just dont think its realistic
Not necessarily. We could easily be back to 280 by then
India news is irrelevant, could blow over before market close.
You have 23 days till expiration. I'd hold for now and sell later. 

Worst case scenario: You exercise the contract and buy 100 shares of PLTR at $19 with a cost basis of $21.65 per share.
Wow 17k deliveries that surely justifies their 50 billion dollar market cap
"you're loss" Idk.. the $58 calls i sold on Monday would beg to differ on that one..
no
BAn
Not a bear. I'm a bull. Not a stupid bull who tries to catch knives though.
Oh they play the lions? Nevermind. Needed more DD. All in on both teams losing
Im with you on that one.
in about 5 months
Yea!!! I've owned RCL since about 62 in calls... actually I owned it from April 22-June 11(panic sold), then again from about Oct 13th until now.
Haven't done my DD on PLTR but BOL to all my PLTR brothers and sisters, may we meet in Valhalla!!!
Good luck! Im hoping one of mine will come back from -70% by dec. 18th... Lol
You never go full retard
O damn you are going to be up big
Oh hell nah I would've been all in on $ROPE
Honestly might be better that way...people overthink this shit when they know too much and never get in.
Pretty low volume day I bet. But pltr is still got some volume today. I sold at open.    Going to reenter maybe later.  Bought some puts just cuz
I have a 12/18 55 and Im too poor to afford more than one contract but Ive got like 8 shares
see it cheers...HF that is a premium price, what is that hedging I wonder
open interest is huge
That's what I am saying. He will want to take over in December, while share price is still below 20$ and maybe after bad earnings
I know its great isnt it.
Hang on brother, we're headed to the promised land
I just have shares so maybe ps5 soon for me lmfao
Hell yeah great strategy for a meme stock you dont care about owning
missed out on like 500 per call but Im holding shares and other calls so could be worse
How low do your balls hang?
I dont even expect it to hit 30 at the end of the week
Sweet 

Im serious though. Not planning on selling this shit for 5-10 years.

I don't see your logic but if you are right, more power to you!
smart, i did the same
Tommorow's Thursday
Thanksgiving break might kill the momentum a bit. I didnt sell calls on all of my shares and Im fine realizing some gain since Im in since $15. The way things are going anything could happen
Don't worry still stuck lifetime.
thats what I'm thinking...thanks for the reply friend
Yeah... That was a bad call. 
If your account closes the day with over 25k, the morning when it opens at 25k+ the pdt restrictions are gone.  Ive done this several times.
Good job. Just think of the lives you helped.
Oh damn, they're going to 10x when they switch to African Tesla.
Remind me! 2 daya
MODS
Will you hold till Friday?

Have you tried r/investing?

Some folks in there that you will relate to
Keep trying to make money from pump and dumps. Youre pathetic
Based on solid analysis bro.
This is the way.
Oh ok you good
I'd sell off your cost basis and ride the rest
This is the weigh?

11/19/21 35c

I have a feeling thats gonna be a ringer
well fuck me. you right!
Were gonna be sucking dick to pay for turkey day at this rate
Lol...food pantry? Shelter? Hahahahahaha
Oof, you can always add more calls my guy
Got out at 100% gain. Might kick myself, might not. Well see
I like the balls on you.
DAMN! Nice job dude
lol
Yee
If the PLTR trade was a day trade, then you will be flagged -> can only close positions until the start of day balance is > 25k
Ive done more trades after getting that info with no ban but Im a retard on WSB so my advice is dog shit lol
You can sell 32 call without triggering the day trading restriction. But understand what you are doing here, I have found an old [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gtlvg7/how_to_lock_in_gains_and_avoid_the_pdt_rule/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb) by someone explaining this. The only thing you are doing here is taking out some of your money, so if PLTR decides to go higher, you will take additional gains but if it goes lower, you will only lose money that you didnt get back from selling 32 call
Nice im in
I bought a mixed lot of 700 minifigs two years ago for around $1,000

broke them into 10-20 figure lots by theme and made $2,500

took forever and not worth the effort, but was fun to do with my son
Sir, this is a casino.
The reason it matters its because that's all they do. Plus the hardware isn't good for much else once obsolete which it seems like you're lucky to have an asic profitable for more than a year
did u hold?
Oh I know. But all the r/politics people on here instantly give Sleepy Joe credit when Mango still very much matters until January.
That means you're bullish right? <3 <3 <3
She was the best. Not gonna lie, it made me cry a little.

Im a smaller player. Thats only 19. I take my profits when I can get them
Me too, made money on a nkla and hylon by getting in when they were cheap spacs and dumping them on the retard pump. Just jumped in spaq at 19 for a day trade thinking it might go a a few more. Nope went down to 10 lmao and bag holding for a month or so instead.  idk if I should hold out for profit or just cut when I break even.
Free trial for RH? Or you mean upgrading to RH gold?
You have a point, in which case it was probably just profit-taking.
A nice Faggy D sir.
yo, im sorry man, but any trading house is going to do that. honestly, etrade and td ameritrade are the best. i'm sorry that that is probably not what you wanted to hear. i've found robinhood to be way subpar.
Im tellin!!!
Standby
It can happen
Yeah I'm out too. 12/24 is far enough out to buy back in Friday if I need to
No negativity, trust me. The rockets just need to uh... refuel.
Ahh. Thatll print
Hope not.   I am long
Ok tnx

Im not used to making money so I sell when I can lol
Probably a good call, I burned a day trade to pull out.
I had 20c for next year and sold them to buy 35 and 40 calls smh
I thought u meant the option price cause its at 14 too
Ahh so WORK moving it up. Thanks on this for sure.
Buy them
I dont know lol. But its about to receive more attention so ride the wave

Price target was raised to 18 but that doesnt matter
yes buy pltr leaps and you will have multiple grands by next week
damn...its bubblin hot today wow
ty for the reminder on that one

bought 20 $25s expiring next week, will just try for a 3x win on it and call it a day
Be a chad and buy sq on dips
oh i just meant gay shares.
personally, I have some SPY puts. but more of a hedge.
If it's gonna be an index get one of the 3x ETFs
Its now in mostly leaps Jan 2023 $10c

Its boring but it works and I dont care if it goes back to $18, I have over 2 years to win on them.
Oof lol relatable
Ive learned not to chase. I expect Friday to be a good reentry point. But who knows.
My dude. Hold till Friday when it hits 32. Sell then roll out onto 12/4 calls.
Get ready lmao
Oh sounds like a 10 bagger
You missed it.
Nah bro I think thats how it works
Ayy good shit
oh don't worry, i've lost plenty on them too. kinda not worth it, but paper hands and all...
Holy fuck lmao
well done
Ravage me bby
Well, I just picked these up after exiting my 12/24 30c for like, 100% profit. Now Im up 30% on these already lmao.
cmps will get IPOs? aren't they just a company that is experimenting with mushrooms? how's an IPO tie into that? ATAI will IPO it says for 1-2B wtf... ok!
As an ipo buyer I approve. So much meme potential, wish I bought more
I kept averaging down. 2500 shares. One of the 3% on this sub that knows what the company does 
Yup had 300
If my  only determining factor was which company had more potential for growth, I gotta go with PLTR.

yessir, holding a 260c Dec 31 and a 277.5c Dec 24
Fuk
Im a bit worried but its like all my money in there. I thought it was my break even day :(
Wow. So how long ago were you in the accident that severed your balls?
Why not just buy the 1000 shares back, and set a sell for $35
Ohh ma mannn. Too young to gamble like this
It's an SPAC, which have been performing quite well lately. Ackman is the primary backer and their target for merger is supposed to be in January.

Each share of common is tied to 2/9ths of a warrant that is dispersed on the day of the merger. Funding in the SPAC is equivalent to $20/share.  


If it's Rivian or Stripe you get rich, if it's something else you lose 10-20%
If thats the case You need to leave this site immediately.
I think its all tickers under 1 billion market cap. Once Tuscany investments moons and becomes >1 billion, it can get further pumped
oh yikes idk about that lol..

FSR is literally a real company. just because they recently SPAQ'd does not invalidate that they've already sold an EV in the US.
Oh for sure, I'm just interested in trading the downside on ZM in particular once it's clear their growth is stagnant
Im not anti-Vax you dumb fuck. I personally am not getting it. I see the value but for 70%-80% herd immunity Im also at like the complete bottom of all the people who need it. So at that point Im most likely given the option to get the vaccine which Im gonna choose not to. Shut the fuck up with your tyrannical bullshit or go live in China retard.
Good move cashing out some. That has been the number 1 lesson I have learned since starting  you cant let calls just balloon indefinitely because with rising gains, comes rising risk. Every dollar you gain adds exposure to correction that can really hurt you if youre not careful.
go to s33king 4lpha. they have a good article on it. I got in early in TTD and made a killing. MGNI is in the same industry. Connected TV. They highlighted it as a big growth driver for them. check out market cap of mgni vs ttd.
Well, im in
Dude,  half these autists use wsb sentiment as their only guiding tool for trading decisions, the other half just draw a buy/sell line down the middle of their cats litter pan.
I have high hopes for PLTR w this PR coverage
IBKR or TastyTrade for options my man
I truly believe CRSR is worth more than $50/share. So I think buying at this price is still a steal
Haha Ive found the exact opposite to be true in my situation..every time I thought about selling cause shit was at ATH, I waited and it just went higher 
Its beyond meat competitor. Ipo jst came out. Its supposed yo be better then bynd or atleast similar
Lol probably not. But 40-50 is realistic.
Exactly, so why are these doomsayers calling for the end right now?
You first 
Which banks?
Yeah bro commissions would eat alot of the gains especially if youre scalping in and out like I was. I might try again and Think about it like an option instead of worrying about the minute candle to candle action
I was planning on starting with 10k - seems like it varies by broker by a lot
Sell right away at open, cruise rally wont stop with the vaccines out now.
Yeah for sure haha. Those sets he dropped on soundcloud this year are amazing too if you havent already checked them out
T H C and then a B after it. Cant say it since its under 1 billion market cap so automod ban

Glad someone is making the bank shorting this clown car company.
The company that will build skynet.
Good perspective, thanks. Might need to reduce my SPY/IWM positions, they arent going to hit
He still works. He doesn't have to, but he does. What's funny is he doesn't care about the price of the stock much at all, since he knows he'll never sell as long as he keeps getting that dividend. And, since he doesn't actually need it, he just keeps reinvesting the dividends.
Ok not quite at that level...
Haha aaaaaand it's back
How do you not get smacked with thePTD label
Gotcha, doesnt apply to me. Thank.
AMZN not in SP idiot.
New Roadster/Convertible?
That's good too
Tease him with all the money then straight to prison.
Naw naw, profit is profit, it's better to secure a profit rather than missing the only chance u can to secure it, if u know what I mean
NET has actually been a fucking safe haven in my portfolio for a long time.

Doesn't really drill that hard, and has been slowly grinding up. $70 is quite high though, I am past 100% gain on my shares and probably should think about exiting soon...
Yep. Just be careful of waiting till the day of. If it's a red day, they might expire worthless because no one will buy them from you. Bye bye money. Good luck!
nice. i ended up in TSLA before the latest green dildo, no complaints here
Was +$2k last week so can't complain. Brought my play account back from $300 to $2500 in like 7 trading days. But I sold a PLTR$18c 12/18 when it hit $21 that has been haunting me
Prob not
Solid position for quick gains. I have 2022 20c leaps and just scalping weeklies every day.
That's what I'm hoping for, although I've played some SPACs and post merger hasn't been great for some
Basically
now its even more red
would have been 11x right now... 3k into 35ish
you should have the money for 1 ITM or ATM leap from the profits
You seem level headed and well informed. Thanks for the free expertise. <3
tunes is out here somewhere
Youre like Nostradamus. That was prophetic
[deleted]
This will be at 35+ by end of year
Lol that would be so sick. Leave a note for the next guy hahaha
I suppose, was just weird that it was like an $8 drop out of nowhere
Doubled down on my positions during the flag bc of your comment
What's the significance of that PE ratio? Aspiring retard and still learning. I appreciate it!
I wanna do a CRSR but I cant decide whether to be bullish or bearish on it. Its down a big chunk right now. Gut says a 2 week call out.
The former(as long as they dont charge interest)! 

If your full statement is $550 then leave about $15-20 on it, a very small balance to show activity on your account. 

Basically, try to stay under 30% utilization(dont go near your credit limit)  on it and just keep up on your payments. Those are the biggest factors.
Thats PS5 money get it
I thought that it was entirely banned in the country, not just the apps. Thanks for the info!
I see. Thanks
I think mediocre earnings are priced in tbh. I dont think anyone is expecting them to beat earnings, at least not in Q3. In Q4 sure

Alright nice one, cheers
Cool, thanks for the info
Im hoping to hit 270 and get out there
well shit. now what brother. what you hoping it will reach?
I'm averaging down. I feel like a boomer but the market seems greedy and things always get weird around holidays. You better know I'm selling my puts and buying calls as soon as theres a dip tho!
Lucky bastard! If you think PLTR will keep climbing just hold them till next week. You can also sell one. Cash in your initial investment and then hold the rest till next week and sell before Friday.

Good luck my dude
you sold calls on PLTR with 2k? pretty sure that's margin lmao
yankee thanksgiving

Yeh agreed. Im searching for those too, some of these premiums are bonkers. 

May I suggest Jan 21

Wmt 170
Wfc 32.5
 
And have you heard of PLTR ??
To calls yes lol
Money to be made if we can get some sort of hype to hcac... retards at citi lol.
Oh shit lol
That's a $250bn market cap.  Feels high on current revs and growth but who knows?
I'm holding my Jan 2022 $12.50 LEAPS until Jan 2022.
You want me to lie and say it will moon to 100? P/E ratio, RSI, comparison to competitors, etc. all  indicated it was due for a massive correction. I sold my calls I was up 1900% yesterday.
Good luck Im gonna trade PLTR make some tendies  for the next hour then dump it all into crsr end of day
Dont be mad bro. I sold at the top this morning.
hate that robinhood day trade limit shit
no offense taken bro. there was a noticeable difference in how ppl in here interacted with me before and after MGM.
we've talked before
That guy invests in AOC karma
I have a 320 , Jan 2022 expiration .
Florida isn't seeing anywhere near the hotel bookings needed to survive. What isn't driven by tourism is driven by conferences and neither are really happening.
Soundin like the dude who backed up the truck for pets.com lol
better sell soon
Big test flight coming
I see lol
40 Dec 2020, 100 Dec 2021
I hope so!
I did the same with SPCE, fair point
Gotcha, but seriously please come back and buy again Monday.
Yes buy bro 
Wait for the dip. Got it. 

The FOMO is real.
30 is so close. Wtfff
lmao but I agree it does feel bad missing out on bigger gains
I've actually been using it more and more lately.  I like it too.
You right
I didnt trap myself but I regret not selling off my holdings yesterday when even I knew today would be red. Cue I dont know what I expected meme
No, It would be a mixture of corn, thick bois, and maybe a company that has publicly said they are going bankrupt
Yeah that's the idea. Falling knives sometimes fall for a few days, I'd go even less, 20%. Because it's high risk high reward to catch a falling knife, so any positive exposure you have will be amplified anyways
nope. i got in last week. you just sound like an idiot
congrats man
Exactly... Wait till it hits 18
No you idiot my calls are dead hahaha
just trying to understand lmao
Its an investigation into Evergrande, youre good. NIO is the largest Chinese EV with actual plans and presence in the EU, youre good. Just dont paper hand it
just broke 26, you lost again
I dont know how to read that word
my dog is dead. I miss u
Also, it sounds like you're buying "limit" calls where you choose how much you're willing to spend on the option. There should be a drop down or something where you can change the "order type" from limit to market. Buying at market just means you'll pay whatever the cheapest someone is currently selling the option for (which will be somewhere between the bid and ask price)

good boy
Sorry couldn't understand your last post over all the retardness
Start picking out the yacht
Damn theyre either a few weeks late or a few weeks early. Well see haha
FUCK IT, SAME
It may retract, but I think due to the hype theyre going to keep growing and in a couple years were going to look back on this week as a wtf was I thinking not buying in at $20 

Yeah I had a couple hundred on IPO. 

I may keep my calls and exercise in December depending on how this goes and join Theta Gang.
nice
But it wont reach that number so how is it free $, an I missing something
Hey, I got scared, and sold 40 11/27 calls on Monday. Right now, that would have been an extra $28,000 I could have cashed out.

Ask yourself: do I need this money now? And also: if I lose this money can I survive mentally and financially? 

I had no reason to sell Monday aside being annoyed with other stuff and having a hangover.

That annoyance and hangover cost me close to 30 grand. I didnt need the base cost of the money, it would have just been inconvenient to have it lost - not devastating = no reason to sell. 

Dont make the same mistake I did for the same reason, but if you have to have the money then you are making a decision for the right reasons.
Psychedelics are the new antidepressant med. They hold ATAI.
No problem king now go make some money
Stocks a lot of them lol. I feel like my capital will be tied up for a while and good luck to you too.
Baba was at 250 on Friday and just closed at 280. If youre still red sell everything and buy puts on yourself
And RKT
There isnt much risk. If the merger gets fucked you get $10 per share cashed out. That means according to current stock price your risk is under $2 per share for a much higher profit potential
How is it risky? $10 max downside
Why, hype dies?
You have to call in and get enough hype to get them to get those strikes. 

June 2021 is as far as they'll go now, but I think we will see 2023 options by January.
ZM, TWLO, WORK, TSLA mostly
Those are ITM, why are you worried?
Still insider
you seem like a solid professional, so I will believe you... but if you're wrong, I will be mildly upset.
Ok sounds good. Will grab some of the dip now.
We dont claim you yall belong to jersey or some shit 
Thanks.
you rascal
Hell release them once the audits done.
I wanted to but the iv was so bad just wasnt worth it for me. Still see the company going back to under $10
There is going to be a dec tumble but it won't be political related. Balance funds need to sell something like .5 trillion dollars of equities and move into bonds to keep their allocation levels consistent.  And that is just the money we know about.
Appreciate it but I flipped out at 50% so if the run continues Im done so, flipped into my boys Tuscan
This is not correct ma dude, i never gain somethin
can see it realistically being $300, <- this is me being an idiot but a more reasonable moderate answer is $285, we broke $280.06 yesterday which was extremely strong for us
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

Beware the retard strength
Oh ya, well NIO or apLTR or CRSR all work as comparisons
Its up to you and thats true, maybe for an even smaller theta. But holding is fine.
1 pm eastern so 3 hours earlier
1pm
you might have a chance tbh
Im fairly confident that is already priced in
Depends on whether or not you see it as a pullback or a continuous dump. What's your exit point? Maybe take some profits and let the rest ride.
Ha yeah fair enough sounds like a good idea keep some skin in the game. Im bullish got shares and options
Iktf
Sad times, I always loved ford cars
Just 2 $362 puts for 12/4 I bought earlier today.  All the memes getting killed is very bearish.  Have to make the decision if I want to sell Friday during the half day or hold til next week.  Thinking theyre just taking market down so next week can be bigly green.
Country club is full of people who sold early, appreciate it dawg
Yes if you are in the same instrument going in and out and have had losses on it during the year you would need to wait 30 days to count them against this years gains.

That said you have to see where those potential losses would land tax bracket wise then weigh that against possible gains.

I suspect the gains would make it worth it to just continue as is.
that was such a strong comeback, i'm legit buying 1k in calls right now. What symbol?
Yeah it's tough seeing people make 10 baggers on other tickers but there's a lot of luck involved in that
yh bro , i'm already in profit. I bought shares at $45.20 so we are good for sure :) was just a short term play for me , how long you plan on holding ?
Hmmm ok. I'm dumb but I'm pr sure u have to buy and sell in the same day for it to be counted. If u sold a position u had purchased the other day, I don't think buying another one will trigger PDT. But don't take my word for it and fuck urself. Anyway, good luck broski!
As long as you don't sell them today, you're good. Sell and buy is fine, buy and sell is not.
Very nice.
yeah still in myself at least.

I saw the thing about penny stocks, so was NIO a penny stock? was PLTR?
Don't get why is it banned.
Options are not available, only shares and warrants. Should the merger not get though, your paid out $10 per share and its trading at $11 atm so low risk high reward
Yeah I sold one as well but bought it back yesterday for a loss. Hold on on selling covered calls until volatility goes down so it can be predictable. If I were you Id sell one way out of the money just for a small return so you can make your way back on the loss
I'm gonna sell my $362C for a loss if it hasn't bounced at all by noon
I got out a bit early but I am kinda not feeling comfortable getting back in yet, idk. I took a lot of profit and feel okay for the moment. Best of luck to you brother
Logitech has the pockets of big tech companies ordering more WFH gear for employees. When the pandemic is done with, WFH will still continue for lots of tech companies. It is still a primary hardware company. You can't scale it well. IF CRSR's ipo success continues others like EVGA, Coolmaster and more will go public.
When it's rocketing like this? Yes. You want to lock in gains. So find a price you feel comfortable with but won't sell immediately on regular drops during the day
My man 
PLTR
Buy the dips, it's finally being discovered. I sold a third of my stack at 13.50 expecting a slight pull back, I'm kicking myself for it. Also has a 100% buy rating
Weeklies on earnings may be an answer. But probally the wrong one.
Nah

12/18 25c here
Feel like that one is gonna be out of moon juice very soon. Would have been a perfect entry point at 125ish.
Oh I didnt get in on it lol.  I wish.
T H C and then B. Cant say ticker as its under 1 billion market cap and hence automodded. Its a merger SPAC for EV battery. Announcement deadline is on 3rd December (with extension to 7th). Should go up bigly like C I I and C. Was called by the same guy. Heres the DD most of WSB is balls deep with warrants and shares.

Because aint nobody want to work but slack
And you always do the opposite in this market.
Oh yea. If day trades dont matter to you drop it on good profits. We might hit 28 today depending on how hard the next pullback is
Also selling weekly puts for tards like you I guess. Enjoy when they expire worthless.
I've recently switched to kraken because you can 100x leverage some of them
We're sitting on several catalysis right now.  Are you current on the latest GME drama?
Massive sell candle right there 
Yea Im trying to save my account here, need 355P 11/27 or at least head that way bc I have 30 for a cost basis of .12. 

Volume is low, greed is high, something has to shake loose
Fomoing commencing, this feels bigly
oh ofc, nbac prolly going. mid 20s next week on some spac shit lol
Lol. I totally mustve missed it!
Thanks. Bought the dip
It's getting blasted all over WSB, just scroll through a bit. Lot of "next PLTR!" posts
Ok
To keep it simple, its a question of supply/demand.

If these investors want to sell they will flood market with supply(shares) and it could drive price down.

So it does pose risk to us share holders
truuuuuu
Ah I've got 12/18 17.5c and 20c so I'll let it ride. Hopefully 20c will be ITM by EOD lol
You just bought another put didnt you?
Just my preference. Pre and post market trading, shit coin, ipo, 2nd offerings, better magic crayon charts.
Cool spread! Thanks for sharing  
Yeah I was up 400% so I was like "Why push my luck?" Which is what I say with almost every contract I buy/sell too soon lol
Agreed. Just don't know how soon and not sure how quickly the media hype will begin. That's why I went with shares for them and options for RIOT.
Interesting
Hopefully good day to average down on these
Those are for pussies. I believe in this long term hence why I haven't paperhanded my shit. You think it;ll atleast recover half of the losses by EOD? Has a pretty strong support at $44.50
I mean, we literally had a huge SPAC downturn really recently lol.

They're not special
Fuck man rip :/
Link it, Im not seeing it anywhere
At this point I have no clue.. this stock is just crazy
I fucking hate trading euro markets they have no volume. But trading NYSE/Nasdaq there are so many fucking fees
Maybe. Won't see ATH this year either. It's not even profitable yet, and yet exclusively good news are priced in for YEARS. Fair value at $13.83, but I'd be a buyer under $25. Maybe I'll miss out but I'd rather invest in what I'm comfortable with and confident about.

Oh, and I already made 100%+ when I bought at sub $25 average and sold at 51.
This is the way  
Nobody tell him.
Sell it and when you get the PDT ban, go open a TDA account. Way more reliable
you made me do it :( cus I do NOT hate money
Yeah but that's pennies on the shorts dollar though.
Oops. I mean on Friday
Meme strength
Most of the companies flying away right now are speculative. This is a whole new market. Thats the problem, could go on for years tho so not a bad idea
Hey that works too
Man coke!
Prices not seen since 30 minutes before yesterday close
Yes.
NONBELIEVER! GET HIM AND THROW HIM INTO THE KARP POOL!
Gotcha, heathen, may you never own PLTR again.
yeah thats the 7-bagger one.
Ive done this before. It is peak retard but I always want to pay below market price at that point in time.
Rip. Not like 1 or 2 dollars matter much though when it doubles/triples. Unless you are buying a shit ton of shares
It hasnt even started. Not even a little. Less than that.
My bad, its the original Reuters article that does, not the breakdown you linked

Yeah I don't envy the mods at all. It's a fine line and I wouldn't want to be on the hook for what us idiots start buying.
Not on RH at least

IB
Yea, but you gotta think long term. Even though you see ppl making 5x returns in a day or two, if you play it smart and fast forward a month or two, youll probably be ahead from someone who consistently trades FOMO, probably by a lot
Its all because I follow the advice of you magnificent retards and PLTR. Elon owns a couple of Porsches. He wont mind me. If he has an issue Ill blow him for forgiveness
im not even american fatty
Ok retard
yes we are bitch
Lol Im desperately trying to put more money in thats left as cash
It definitely could. However almost everything is done by AI bots now a days and all of that is based on speculation of future gains. This is a new frontier of trading. There may not be a bubble burst outside of like an Enron style crash and burn.
R they still up 10% lmao
ahhh such a safe answer well done
its a joke how important the stock market is. All the Senators, Congress, and politicans just want the market to go up they don't care at all about working people
Should be working out for you innit? I don't think it'll make meaningful moves though, stay frozen within the range
I bought 10x $34p for $2.05 right before close.

The CEO went on Crammer and pooped his pants.

Stonk crashed and I sold them at open for $5.38 at open.

Was just trying for a 50% win but 150%ish was fine with me.

Now back to rooting for PLTR (sold 10 more of the 50 $25s I bought last week because of that meme).
will buy it for 10 cents on the dollar (puts on yer turkey!)
Nice! Yeah I set a limit for my 15.5 12/24 and i was about to cancel when it filled. Opened another for 25.5 1/8
Ya but I was believing in one more day of retard strength 
Bought FDs yesterday at close. I was actually playing that they would release more phase 3 data, but we got the EU contract instead. Follow em close as im long as well
Yeah I'm still not getting it. Who sells anything. All we do is buy here. Where are all the sellers??
My Pfe calls that's down 5k would like to have a word with you.
Pypl and sq are cooking , will there be a drop
Monitor for a late day pull back.
There is strong momentum in your favor. Markets are closed tomorrow, hope you aware.
Sweet, were definitely getting back to 26 and 75k shares is literally nothing.
Thanks for the explanation. In case of shares then just hold if you have them and if not wait for volatility to pass?
I bought some puts lets short the fucker am I right?
I dont know what itm is
NOW I want some!
12/31 30c doing well.
gambling is a sin, heathen
ss
I feel the same way last week. I bought at the highest peak on Wednesday and rode my calls down to -50%. Happy I held.
Lol do you mean returning from* the grave?
all good, profit is profit. I dont think pltr gonna go below $20 ever, around 1M wall in that mark
His calls were for Jan
That the way to do it. No fear that way
Pretty easy to sell premarket if it continues to fall...
I was just laughing at the fact you lost it all on AAPL.. That boomer is shit
Oh yeah I agree but the premium will be better if you wait for a dip. Super low put premium when you sell on a day like today where its run so much
Yeah but you stay in til it stops going parabolic
Those are already expired friend....about that 10k...
Its a bad thing for my FDs :(
Hey, up about 8%. Hows it going?
What did he say? I cant read or write
Noice
True and I cant see vix dropping that much lower now
That news came out 24hrs ago and BABA rallied anyway
[deleted]
Lol. Meant hold tight
Aren't those under "cash settled futures"?
Were you not there on Monday or yesterday. There was non stop talk about it lol. There still is
Fo sho bro!
For sure
eastern promises is a great unknown film but requires attention. amazing flick though- wish it had more buzz so people would give it the hype it deserves
Ive bought PLTR calls every day this week. I sell them EOD because im a pussy but I have yet to not get close at 100% return each day. PLTR is so retarded it just doesnt stop
Yes. Massive moves I. 2 weeks? Maybe. Depends on what happens with Iran / Saudi / US/Israel spat. 

Will it go up bc Its largest oil company ? Yes. By about 30 dollars
It literally cant go tits up
If not today, Friday. If not Friday, next Monday. If not Monday, Tuesday.


Stonks only go up brotha. CRSR is the real deal, not some fake ass AYRO or SOLO bullshit
For real the worst thing you can do right now is panic sell your position. If youve got calls, I know the earliest one doesnt expire until 12/18. Thats still plenty of time for this gap back up
Because theyre impatient.
Dont get me wrong, Im currently long on $TNA thats directly connected to $IWM, but it having runs like this isnt stable. The small pullbacks are good for it.
Got it thanks. But its still negative? What amount of vix is good ? How can I understand
My guy, it's up 161% this month. Dropping to 24.5 temporarily is NOTHING. There's also no indication based on the fact that it's still up 7% on the day as I'm writing this..
Bet you feel super dumb right now....PLTR is up 19% right now hahahahahha
so in dumbass terms, low RSI means VIX goes up?
You asked for a fast way to earn mad loot

19 pays 35 to 1

Now get out there and WIN!

If you let it ride and score 3 times in a row you will have 4+ million in under 5 minutes.
It's cheap at 300 just on fundamentals of ecommerce business + alicloud alone without considering shares in XPEV and ANT.
That news is 2 months old. Also the CEO of clover is being investigated by the SEC
Apple? You cant be serious
Guess
got it
Not sure, ZM didn't respond
LGVW
Nice.. So over 200% already then
best I can do, I have to sit on it and who knows when a buyer for something like that will come along, I might be able to do 8 but thats the very best I can do and I shouldnt even do that
Next week but stock moving ahead of news 
If you write a call and it expires OTM then yeah. I'd recommend you do some reading though before you start writing calls though lol
I cashed out my initial investment amount yesterday and am letting the remainder ride closer to the official merger date.
Yes. I have mainly played spacs this year and they all go down.  You're competing against people who got in at 3 cents a share, and you have made wonderful gains. Congrats.
And? A buyout usually requires a premium over how much it is worth.
Not looking forward to TDA and Schwann merger. Leave my TOS alone.
Here. Take my hand  well be fine. Lot of short sellers and bag holding. Let people unload their bags first
Don't feel bad. Someone actually bought a baba put from me when it was near 250. I'm bullish on the company
Yeah was sort of kidding. If I had held my JWN calls from October and just deleted the app till now, Id have a 15 bagger.
I have 01/15s so I have room if the lock up period expiring doesn't cause it to dip a lot.
Ya gettin nervous man!
Limit order with limit price is what I use for selling my options at my desired price. I have never used stop limit.
There was also a hint dropped by CEO i believe that he wants to introduce it to Europe, much like NIO.
Lmao good luck
good simple overview here: [https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/wash-sales-rules-tax](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/wash-sales-rules-tax)

## What is the wash-sale penalty?

If the IRS determines that your transaction was a wash sale, what happens?

You can't use the loss on the sale to offset gains or reduce taxable  income. But, your loss is added to the cost basis of the new investment.  The holding period of the investment you sold is also added to the  holding period of the new investment. In the long run, there may be an  upside to a higher cost basisyou may be able to realize a bigger loss  when you sell your new investment or, if it goes up and you sell, you  may owe less on the gain. The longer holding period may help you qualify  for the long-term capital gains tax rate rather than the higher  short-term rate.

That can be the silver liningbut in the short term you won't be able  to use the loss to offset a realized gain or reduce your taxable  income. Getting a letter from the IRS saying a loss is disallowed is  never good so it's best to err on the side of caution. If you're  concerned about a buying a potential replacement investment, consider  waiting until 30 days have passed since the sale date. Or work with a  financial professional who should be able to confidently navigate the  ins and outs of taxes and your investments.
lots of spill over into FSKR too lol
tl;dr: sell your calls, then buy calls with an expiration date way further out, like in the middle of 2021

Sir, this is a casino.
The DIX was at 38% yesterday with big divergence from S&P... reminded me of March/September/October... I cashed out my positions today 
Rootin for ya. My paper hands cant handle this shit lol
I rolled my 22c into 30c and it's looking pretty good
I am a zoomer, and I know the zoomers that get their financial advice from TikTok. Not much there
In that case,   
I'm glad that i can sell tesla puts at open and close my calls. Clown ass market
Wasnt really beat up just had no attention
It's China, it's to be expected. All manipulation and corruption is baked in there.
Don't miss it. I cashed out of NIO at $51 but if these stocks have a hard crash that's an easy buy. Nio under 35, TSLA under 300, buy and get rich
Been in nio since 33
the calls i sold against my shares are up over 340% this week. such is life
Don't compare yourself to others.  You did great.  
  
I don't think this subreddit is a healthy place for you (or anybody really), honestly consider taking a break from here.  
  
And please, please, please do not start revenge trading / making high risk moves to try and 'get back' some of that money.  
  
I'll say it again.  You did great.
Enjoy the 10k buy yourself something stupid so you remember the joys of gains.
To be honest I think its a $100 stock 5 years down the road. With the new director of national intelligence being a former exec of Palantir, their current exec board and clients, its a long term stock for sure. Take some time off trading, it seriously is just money, and cool companies come around all the time. Youre pretty smart if you really believed in this company way before it blew up, so I have no doubt you could do it again. Think why you believed in it so strongly and take those principles and look at other companies. Thats called an edge, and its how you become a successful trader. Thats why I have no doubt you can hit 10 baggers in the future, and man my dms are always open, dont kill yourself, youre an intelligent retard.
Woah dude relax with that thought, you made 10k on it so be happy, why not buy some shares with that profit and make some more money?
So you're comfortably ITM at this point. Theres no trading tomorrow and Friday is shortened to 1PM. Unless you have $2200 to take assignment then you should sell it before Friday close. If you don't understand options there's less risk just selling today and taking your profits
a dec 18th call or later.

Give yourself some time.
u dont know shit bro. chill
 u guys scared af
Maybe maybe not. I took profit And will buy the dip
Early he said
1 pm
Boomer GUI but absolutely legendary fills. Make sure you get the paid version. The commissions are worth it
Ehhh I feel like you were being serious.  Good try tho.
Buying at the top. A classic WSB move.
27
Yeah roll it forward, like another guy here said: if its too ITM, you will have to sell at a slight discount to get someone to take it off your hands (kinda like arbitrage for the buyer), better to get a new contract with a new strike that will have a closer bid-ask spread
bro ur so cold, i got some at 34 sold at 38 only got 500 profit but eh
no worries up 17.7k today

yes I am riding PLTR like a motherfucker
If it doesnt run up solidly next week then yeah that call is boned

I have a 275c 1/15/21 that Im considering letting go at 15% profit
That's stupid. A 100% gain is 200%* the share price, which is why it's a two bagger.
Yea Im done buying back calls for a loss imma just let the shares go from now on
not those, push back one week
I know right look at that sexy face this car is gonna sell
Honestly sometimes the best play is to not do anything at all
I am. Tractors win by orders of magnitude.

You've never been driving through Bumfuck Alabama and seen one of the locals filling up a 2000 gallon tanker trailer that they top off monthly?
I got in at a decent time, and have some left over cash. Not enough for a ton of calls. It's so overpriced now.
I put half my portfolio on calls last week, and the rest sitting cash, not enough for 100 shares
I'll give you overvalued but why do you think a scam? I'm not even in NIO, but delisting is an extreme. Not even Nikola got delisted.
After losing for nine months
I believe in this one the DD post was legit
Wow $875??? Youve made it friend well done
[deleted]
I just bought some $35c for next week just now.
Dude chill
Correct
Bro, its rallied ~50% already.... of course it's going to be down some. Doesnt mean thjs is the pop.
Yeah its looking really bad you absolute dongus.

They have a deadline but I dont remember the exact dates
Im sure they would announce it while EV is so hot right now and would make them a lot of tendies.
 love a little insider info 
Oh, okay. Well that I can see!
Options are complex derivatives, you shouldn't buy them if you don't understand how they work
I wish I knew friend.
Just trolling the 
The fact that it's banned here? Isn't that enough?
I can just double down, Im good.
That was not a dump lol, more like an ant dip. Pretty cool.
Ive watched it since IPO and except for the spike to 30, its been sitting around low 20s most of the time. Hope it goes up for the people invested in it though!
Okay yeah but real premarket hasn't even started yet. Was there some news or something?
5/12 500p, if i see a bounce i just close and get farther put. i love the lord but his ship is too full right now.
Yes but you could also have sold at lower level and fomod on gains too.
I have a friend in digital marketing at YUM. Smart dude and Im a sucker for Nashville hot sauce with KFC tendies
 they are just holding companies. Nobody buys a spac based on that.
Lmao breh, it doesnt matter
Wait a week.
Just turn the app off for a week and marvel at the gains. Easy.
you belong here
But the next expiration is 11/27? Theyre not 0dte
Insiders cant  sell till lock up period is over
No idea, I'm buy and hold on this one. Long calls and premium. It's a legit investment until they find a ceiling but it could easily end up with a 50b market cap IMO.
U fucking mad bro? ;)
Well, essentially if its no where near ITM its going to lose value by then. Remember, the closer you get to the expiry the less its going to be worth essentially.
No shit, other way around for me.

In reference to my previous comment, I jumped on the PLTR train only 3 weeks ago and my contract options are up 780%
Preach 
"Entire net worth" is hyperbole - but my real point is, no risk, no reward. Part balls, sure, but also part strategy/circumstances (I've been poor before, I am not afraid of being poor, I just don't want to be again), part acceptance of mortality (I can't take any of this with me, nor can my family, and the only real wealth in the world is time). You want real feedback on your portfolio from a guy on the internet? From where I'm sitting you have a lot of redundancy. VTSAX and FSKAX already both hold FB, MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, AMZN. Also, VTSAX is up 16% this year - at 26% of your portfolio, that's a little over 4% portfolio growth that you can *pretty much* count on because of that holding alone. Knowing that, what do you really have to lose by liquidating some shares and swing trading 1-2% of what you have? This is not advice, I don't know what your circumstances are, but it's worth considering.
Honestly, you have sound management practices and seem to know what youre targeting. I feel like you could hit your 5% ytd target with little issue. 

Maybe just read through the memes and shit in here to get you in the right vibe for it, then take whatever youre comfortable with losing and effectively gamble it. Its totally possible to do plays you see on here within reason - especially if youve got 200k to play with. That way, even if you lose on a couple of them, youll still largely be up.

If I were you, and in the spirit of WSB, Id take like $5,000-10,000 of it and gamble on some call options. Im up 100% in the last month just off of like 20% of my portfolio.

Youd be surprised. If you catch a meme stock early enough just browsing around on here, you could make fatty boi stax.

If you dont have a day trade just convert the calls into spreads by selling a call for same expiry date just 1 call higher to lock in profits.
Yes. Has strong support at 275. Would get calls for January/February.

Dang just read up on this... not sure why nobody is talking about especially with how much everyone loves its competition.. oh well thx for the tip and heres to hoping 
Thats Friday
No, retard, tomorrow is Thanksgiving
aight
[deleted]
Hope you're making your money back and then some with these puts.
I was smart and played FSR. I've been burned by the EV market month, I'm used to this disappointment.
the most annoying thing about this discussion thread is people yelling shit like this 100 times a day and then once a year they get something right and go "see!!!"
I literally bought a $26 call this morning and Im up $250. You have to be big dumb to not make money on it. But buy high and sell low and keep complaining my guy.
I am glad you are optimistic. I genuinely do hope shit keeps rising
First down since ipo, going to be big
Look at the market overall among popularly traded stock genius. Or is your watchlist consist of only meme stocks?
Since u have it, maybe hold for a while
I'm very happy for you
Manifest destiny wasn't just going to make itself happen!
Im actually not holding any lol i sold my SOLO two days ago
Because smart money is buying bonds as equities continue to become more and more risky.
The employee of company got stock options when they work there on top of salary equivalent to like $3/share for the employees that were there early on. There was a lock-up period to when they were allowed to dump those shares to get cash.
DEF HOLD.
lol
Oh lol. Yeah youre probably right, I think we could see 28-29 EOW though.
Yeah Im around 10k
Too I also got PLTR too which is helping. I averaged in a few NIO far calls
 PLTR headed to Uranus confirmed?
Thanks, brb gonna google what market cap means real quick
If you're having those thoughts your brain is lying to you and not in a healthy state. Seek help. You need help, and that's okay. You matter, and your life matters.
Well congrats on today.  Holy shit.
Oh.  That doesnt count as a sick fuck.  Im talking specifically about holding options.
Thank you! How does the $25 monthly work as a collateral? Say, PLTR hits $29 by 11/27, how does having $25 monthly help?

Thanks again!
ahhh you might be lucky then.

I wouldn't blame you, if coin goes anywhere close to its projections and PLTR just doesn't go to zero I might have to become a day trader lol.

Might keep the job for the benefits tho and see if I can "work remote" with zero fucks given.
Mate Ill jizz on my bosses face if it hits $80 by EOY
Yeah mine expire Friday sooooo

Umad I called out ur microcap p&d?  

# 
Lmao..

I was thinking buy another $10k if it drops to $500 

I do miss my 200 shares at 15 I sold though. Also my 25 and 35 NIO's and my 24 crsr but GREEN IS GREEN.

I've learned that I make the right moves and hop on the right trains just usually at the wrong time lol. Too soon or too late now I'm more in and out and it's working much better.
UP UP UP up uP
naw I slammed calls the second I saw the news. i have alerts on for this guy's twitter

also managed to catch the NFLX pump a month or so ago when they raised sub fees this way
200 cons at like $0.35-$0.40
I put the order in right as it halted. Was still priced really low. Bid/ask was $0/$10 but it filled at my limit of $0.35 right on the unhalt. Algos stupid as hell sometimes lol
Yeah I dont think it clears 30 today. Next week perhaps?? To short of a trading day on Friday, who knows.

My conviction is strong with PLTR. Their first ER was a great despite still reporting a loss/share. Along with retard strength, I think the little more serious holders are already playing up to the next quarters earnings
Yeah just scared its gonna cause overall downtrend
Yes, but BABA investors are really easy to be spooked. For whatever god damn reason there are outside, when they see a reason to sell, it tanks. Let's hope the news be made big about Biden and Xi, then it starts to be priced in.
correct these balls
What happens if your what if scenario loses everything you have and you have to file bankruptcy?

Dude, I do NOTHING but shit post. But, Im being straight with you. You see so many people make so much money. And it emotionally hurts to see someone turn 500$ into a million. Like it fucking hurts my heart. But what you dont see are how many people lose everything trying to replicate success.
I have 15000$ in my td account and right now Im playing with about 1/10th of my portfolio. It was only like 6% or so this morning. If you have 1000$ Im only playing 60$ of it on options.
Lol
Haha same bro Im in on the and TSLA. I thought I was fucked today because shit was crashing at open and I had bunch of NIO and Xpev. I ripped a bong put on some tubes and magically shit recovered haha
Well, they are unreasonably huge. Just a while ago Tesla had a buy of ~565 and sell of ~550. They closed my long position by triggering the stop loss at 550 even though Tesla never fell so low this morning. If this ain't cheating, I don't know what is
You won't regret it
but do you really think they gonna stab their own companies in the back in an international competition? :D
Besides Im Chinese, do you have something to counter my contention with or was that the extent of your wit?
Yeah, we always think that. But I'm not insane enough to short it. It's going up, that's for sure. I could see 650 by EoY...
Glad I bought more! :)
nah - stonks only go up. Havent you heard?
Good chance that makes you money. I aint judging I think were in the midst of something thatll be a bit special.
Theres no fun in shares, Im a retard
Yea same, I did sell half my calls today at 100% profit so I'll just let the house money do it's thing
nah...i got my son out of it....would do it all again. cheers
Put my life savings in calls
considering that many contracts are made for 5+ years he likely wouldnt have a decision. Also presidents dont decide this shit, individual agencies do
Hey paper hands save lives lol. Better modest gains than losses.
Chickened out and sold at 29.50 for a $3k win
Thank u, I will take care from my luxury penthouse after Tesla and PLTR moon for the third day straight
Yea agreed Tesla is a tech company that makes cars, I think theres a lot of truth in that. Tesla also have notorious problems with reliability yet people still buy them and put deposits on them so idk. 

Taking Tesla as an example, its almost entirely an in house repair job, so theres potential for a shift towards that kind of thing, or these cheaper manufacturers go the other direction and make it easier for mechanics to obtain these parts. Tesla feels like the Apple of EVs currently and these cheaper EVs can come through as the Android, providing a nicer entry point into EVs.

In terms of what these other EVs provide, I think NIOs battery swap is a seriously good option that Tesla explored but ultimately abandoned. Especially here in the UK where a lot of people in cities live in flats and not houses, being able to swap your battery up instead of charging it could be a major benefit. Our charging infrastructure isnt great, but it is getting better, but options are options imo. And as Elon mentioned, we need smaller EVs, the current Tesla offerings are on the larger side of most British roads and parking spaces. 

Overall, I think you are right that people are likely to head back to traditional automotive manufacturers for their track record, but I think these smaller EVs have massive potential by being tech first and providing features like self driving in our increasingly connected world. The problem I think the automotive manufacturers will have is getting their tech through the several layers of bureaucracy theyve established over the years which is why infotainment systems have been atrocious while our phones have been rivalling computer performance. I think when people buy EVs its a completely different shift in their lifestyle so they may be willing to take a punt on something like NIO or Fisker. 

I personally think that EVs need to become cheaper which is where economies of scale will come into play but right now, the number of affordable, good range cars that are available (in the UK) are minimal and theyre not particularly desirable. People want a Tesla but not the Tesla price tag which I think is where smaller EVs can come in and provide a just as good experience for a fraction of the price.
Ah congrats and fuck you . Do you own calls longer than 1 week ? I need to buy my wifes boyfriend a new mattress to have sex on
For sure, apparently it shows you have enough discipline.

On another note, my girlfriend is a nurse at a major public hospital and she said her practicum taught her much more than the coursework.
I got a very similar story with PLUG $10 leaps lmao
Listen to their earnings call. 
 
The fundamentals are retard strong, clear up trend in price channel, undervalued, expiries give it plenty Of time to recover from this healty pull back & its already recovering pre market. 

My price target is $100 within 2-3 months. . We got this. 
 Holding my 55c 1/15/21
I'm just trading shares which I know most here don't do. I have no clue about options. How did you learn to trade options
lol I sold half.
You bet. Im likely going to wait till eod to close out my current position and re invest profits into later strikes. A dubs a dub, get an extra helping of turkey you earned it
Only bought 1 contract, should've bought more.
Thank you thats very nice of you to say. I love the job, pay is just lackluster
Cheers. What delta LEAP do you recommend?
This was a hilarious exchange that only we know about
maybe i will eat your dongus
isnt it like 10% of market though?
Forward looking my guy.  They are growing rapidly and will take a nice chunk of the Chinese EV market.  Baillie Gifford (380bn fund)...#1 Tesla holder for last 10 years. Put a 10Y $300bn valuation on Nio (when price was at $8)...oh yea and Baillie is now Nio's largest holder...not Tesla anymore.

https://marketrealist.com/2020/06/baillie-gifford-thinks-nio-stock-worth-more/
Congrats.  I'm in it for the long haul.
Will come back to you in about an hour
Lions have played on thanksgiving every year your entire life, haha

$27 by lunch time
Damn hope you had a good entry point. Im still up 100% from my entry and I reloaded on the dip. Good luck bro. These 3.5 weeks will go quick
my b u right
Neither do I but this week has been one hell of a run. Been holding $20 call since last Friday and good god I wish I had bought more
Honestly thats the move
bless!
African Teslas are just zebras dude
Yur prob
you dont even know me
Id have already killed my self  before I seen any gains
I screen shotted your comment and i just purchased another 100 shares with your name on it. I'll comment back on this in 3 weeks and let you know how stupid you are 
well, I mean T H C B is going to merge with a company that makes the best EV batteries, and i'm cashing that it will happen. Stay salty, boy
Aint no money to pay for Robinhood Gold .. forget calls
Safe to say, you made good moneys. So you made 10k?
Had a $48 stop loss set. I cancelled premarket because I didnt want it to execute. This is just weeding out the non believers
Thanks man! Hopefully this just the start!
thanks for the help. what do you mean by 32 call? that strategy sounds useful but im not going anywhere near any kind of margin call  naked option situation until i understand this shit much better.
that's pretty awesome. yeah i bet that took a while haha
Fuck yeah I did. And then doubled down. I fucking love pltr. Fuck everything else.

Yes my bad Im typing too fast lol
Then hop in my friend
  
I am long on it as well. 1/15/21 calls. Who knows anything can happen in this market. We can moon on Friday or later today for all I know(I hope)
Might fuck around with a few if it dips
What you got?
Some lucky bastard just hit the lotto if they held $20k worth of that $0.04 premium now worth $1.40 for a 3,600% gain.
Its headed that way. What expiration date? Hopefully 12/18

Im just watching it go up and my dick gets harder by the minute
Damn good luck with that. I dont doubt you could sell for a profit in the near term but selling those puts and waiting til expiration seems like free money
Well its torn straight through that PT, Ive bought more
Spy puts does sound like a good idea. Are Black Fridays usually red?
Thanks for the amazing advice. I actually put 6k into this play
Im up 70% on options and 24.5% on shares.
The first thing that drew me to the company was Thiel, then I researched their business/contracts. It was a no brainer. Long hold for sure
Hey man, congratufuckulations 
Thanks 4 the advice!
Nice. Better than my 275 12/11's. Haha. GL!
When it from 25.75 to about 25 today. It bounced a bit back and it was hovering around 25.4 for 30 mins. That's when I got out
Because I'm a pussy
Why wouldn't Stripe go public by itself? Its a very solid company and its international. It brings best business/entrepreneur talent from the world to the US. Its a marketplace for VCs, investors, startups and entrepreneurs. 

> Each share of common is tied to 2/9ths of a warrant that is dispersed on the day of the merger. Funding in the SPAC is equivalent to $20/share.

I don't know what these mean exactly: Common, tied, warrant, dispersed... I'll have to do some research. 

Isn't it like any other stock? I click the buy button on thinkorswim. It buys. I click the sell button. It sells. I lose or make money. You are saying its value will drop to $20 per share, at worst by end of January? Never saw a chart like that before. 

If this is solid, I'll buy 6,000 shares. Literally all my money.
Theyre literally a real company that has gone bankrupt in the past and doesnt currently produce any vehicles.
I hear you. It will def tank in the future. No reason for it to be this high. But it holds the full weight of the market in video conferencing. And we know that's not going away anytime soon. Remember their last earnings. People made an absolute killing.
Yeah well Im learning to find the perfect balance with knowing when to cash out and diamond hands. A lot of time Ill freak out and cash out early and then the stock goes back up the next day. Gains are gains but I couldve made more. But now I have to keep track of when the bubble is going to bust
[removed]
options are scary I want to get some real experience with the market and real money for a while and then maybe dip my toes into options
I have been better about selling half once I cover my cost basis or if it gets over 100%, whichever I notice first.
Because the market is retarded
BAC, JPM
I listen to the second dj set the Illusory volume 2 weekly. That mix is legit the best mix out there right now. Also the Remote Transmissions one where he drops so many new songs is unreal.  Im so happy I was able to see his last Ineffable Truth show in NYc last jan. Best electronic show Ive seen
bruh they really banned the ticker
Thank you brother, Godspeed 
damn, you always hear about people working when they dont need to. that would not be my decision in the same situation lmao, i definitely wouldnt work for someone else
I think it only applies to like 3 people here.
I understand 4head but if big techs are going up and s&p really doesnt feel like it, thats not much of a market rally(looks like its losing steam)
Thats exactly why I did it
Profit is profit ...if it tanked you would be happy you sold
Fair-- we've successfully passed crash testing, haver 10+ prototypes on road, and production will start 2022. very bullish long term, hoping that talk of a big partnership (Uber?) in the short run will bring it 15+. 

If our leadership was 1/10 the hype-man as Trevor Milton we'd be in the 20s right now.
Sound Logic...technicals look good too! ;)
Leaps are year out right?
Just trying to help out the fellow Tesla bros 
Hmmmm were the "real" people ever Slack users? I always thought Slack had a very niche IT workflow market
More like end of month
"cuck"
Lmao hopefully more gains for you
It means price to earnings ratio. It's ordinary that growth stocks have higher PEs, because the investors expect growth. Compare Walmart's PE of 21.93 with Amazon's of 92.78. I think you see now why the PE of 1000 is outrageous. Another growth stock that has been called overvalued is AMD, with a PE of 120. If that's overvalued, what is Tesla? It should be noted PE is not everything and always depends on the company. A company could also have a high PE for 10+ years, and still grow share price, until earnings growth slows. But a PE over 1000 is a bubble to me, Tesla may do other things besides making cars but they don't got the cure the cancer. There's too little upside for me to invest
IV is fucking insane rn, I'd recommend a bull call spread as some protection against both IV crush and some downside. Can either let em ride or buy back the short once it's less frothy 

Daily RSI still high as fuck, I doubt there's a ton of eager buyers rn.
Yeah noone bothers to read anything. That is why the stock drops for no reason and we take their money for being too retarded to read more than the headline.
I hope you're right.  I still see quite a few posts thinking console earnings will be in this quarter, but that may not be representative.
I sold in the middle of this last rip. Up 70% after being down 50%+ this morning. Could have made more but thats always the case and I rarely play weeklies so Im good with it. Probably going to park in shitcoin for a few days. Markets been suspect lately imo
i bought them then sold them for a profit like 10mins later. was i not supposed to do that?
I got a couple WMT already.  PLTR, no I have not heard of such a thing.
Apples and oranges but Salesforce market cap is $230B and its just stupid marketing bs. Meanwhile Palantir has got the hold on data analytics, it blows Salesforce out of the water
let me tell you something about how rockets work. they only go one way and that's up my dude.
don't hurt yourself jumping off the rocket. it a pretty high jump. good luck my dude!
No sorry i have no idea who you are
HAHAHAHHAA

YOU = 
I have leaps. But I want to get a few weeklies. What are you looking at?
lol why
Go in now but go further OTM
Don't forget about tanker gang

Wait that's so April
for sure! Nio is hyped up so much tho atm in this reddit and everywhere else do you think itll actually drop a lot?Also ik kids on this tiktok always like to say To the moon or to mars but realistically how much does Nio have legt in it?
Suck my balls soy boy
Dude.. i dunno if you know some TA at all, but as long as it holds above 23, its going higher. it was going up in a channel, and broke it to the upside (bullish), confirmed it yesterday as support after profit taking then rebounding ,and finished strong. forget low volume PM shit, if it holds above 23 today, expect it to do what NIO did the last 3 months
same..
Just doesnt make to pump things so much and then dump 10-15% in one day, like cmon.

Last time I saw -10/15% PM was when vaccine dropped and all covid stocks got borderline wiped, Etsy hit a circuit breaker almost immediately, 19.5%.

So yeah Im less than excited for this kinda nonsense.
Still watched a 500 loss at open the fear is out there now

I banged your wife Jeff. Miss u too
Thanks for the real answer fr
It requires higher IQ than 0, sorry.
Bad mindset, just spend
I actually sold my 28c 12/11 yesterday for +150% but Im experiencing a hardcore FOMO right now
Haha I feel you bro. Hopefully is not a meme stock, hoping it will hit $12 by next week
I brought just under 270 and sold a little under 277 it was stopping me from YOLOing into more meme stocks lmao
I feel like when i wake up tomorrow it will go to $9 and just die, im retarded
A 1% or more dip after poor economic data is not  unrealistic
Outsider
Grab something with a longer expiry date, if you can.
To expand even more. 7c 1/20/23 contracts are like .32 right now
I see, thanks for the bullish sentiments
Sold. Want to renter, but damn premiums are super expensive.
I made some good gains on my call from yesterday and bought into one that had a larger % movement on the way towards the top. Kind of a rash move on my part lol
Fuck it I sold 200 shares and will hold 300. I honestly like them for a long term play but September and October were not kind to me so I need to start locking in profits when they are around and look for better entries
Haha i pretty much been taking profits daily even if its a couple hundred bucks. I dont chase ten baggers anymore. Im good with 10-20 percent but I put up a lot of cash with this strat.
FSLR , ENPH , SPWR, RUN
True true. I also sold a 12/18 PLTR $18c last week for +100%. Missing out on this tard party
I had 2/21 $40c that I bought on Nov 13th and made me 400% profit. Paper handed because of the dip but shouldve held. Will keep the ones which I bought today till as long as I can. You can see in my post history the $40c 2/201 screenshot which I posted a hour ago.
UK had an option to trade it leveraged and for June contracts

lmao how much did you lose already cuz im up you fucking retard 
This sideways crap at 362.20s pissing me off now
I can see 40 end of December, but maybe it's just me being hopeful lol
Damn, we really hit 20 with another hour to go in the day
Still got time to hop in!
Interesting, I discovered it by my own research but now I am worried lol
Thank you
Nah..
I got itm calls, so you might as well call it shares.
That part. I think theyll respect that 43.46 level and then it keeps running after thanksgiving
Idk, the ones I follow have been doing really well. See: LGVW, SBE, NBAC, CIIC. There are others I cant mention that should see similar gains once a merger is confirmed.
Literally everywhere or just wait for your evening news.
Im upset you didnt tell me about Fisker
Yep
I have 400. Wanted to make it 500
At 10.75 the risk was so minimal. Cuz those shares can be redeemed for 10$ and 22 cents. 

Now the risk is like 200$ on 100 shares.

Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.
Palatir part is at the very end
Ahh okay, I didnt check CNBC
Im opening an account there, is there a capita requirement to get option trading access?
Facts and i agree. Emotion does not belong in trading. 1 year price target for PLTR?
Post your loss porn in 90 minutes lil fella
We shall see
Sold at open :)
The CNBC special.

"Stocks may go up, they may go down Bill. But one things for certain, I am a buyer at these levels, its about the long term play"
Agree
Congratulations!  Your order has been filled.
Tnx
Mine are down too. I bought more. Just because it's not up now doesn't mean it won't later? Do I really have to say that? Godspeed good friend. Mine are late December's and deep 2021s.
hopefully... want to rebuy the shares i sold at 202 haha
Thanks brother. Ill probably just sell when it breaks even, GL to you
Ha ha I'm not so sure if you're right but I have my eyes on IWM puts
In the money
It was at 276.7 pre market and then it goes back to 275
Ya but a lot of time erosion happened between now and then.  I bought 1/15 17c for 0.03 a week or so ago.
and lose 2 bucks on each share? not that easy on the heart if umade 1 milly on it like my boy, and refused to roll out into somn with a floor... hes sweating but stil with 600k
For sure.  I've been selling them since it was trading at $22... all the way back... to yesterday.  LOL.
Shit 2021 my bad
F in the chat
no gm deal isnt official, this is ur chance now to ride tendy train down the hill with no engine
These past two weeks have been a hell of a run up and it's at near pre-covid levels. I'm not sure it has a much lower floor once the recent euphoria kind of dies down
My biggest concern is that UVXY will kind of drop to $9-$10 level and I would be stuck selling covered calls on it until it bounces up a bit at some point in the future. But I would probably just average down my share price position by buying more batches of 100 shares at the lower price and sell more covered calls until it bounces back up at some point (inevitable but not predictable).  But honestly that's not a bad scenario it would just be boring to be locked into one ticker for too long
Believe me I've played all sides including theta. Still in the red and growing out if it. But yes, living and learnin.
Imma stay in till I see burry leaves. Shits got a fat divi and Im not one to leave nice divi atocks
No idea. I mostly use the mobile platform since my laptop is a piece of shit and dont want my employers to have the possibility of seeing my degeneracy. Should probably explore the platform more.....or not
Damn going to the check this out brother, appreciate it
My call is down so much, its insane
Ive got stocks
Ok thanks
VIX goes up market goes down
To put it more autistically, the optimism was causing an overselling of VIX
Wtf are you talking about
I see you didnt look up clover news, have a great day Im sorry you feel so negatively about IPOC lol
Bro were on my comment thread ab fang not the Apple comment I posted. But fang is half what it was pre covid and Apple has had decent call volume the last two days.
Weird indeed

I wouldnt be surprised if some sort of news comes out after market close
Not my dec call
Sell at 35?
Yeah dude. But the article says the talks are stalled.  My puts are for 11/27.  You and I can both be right.
Lol I sold before earnings. Was a bit risky since they missed the last two quarters. But o wells
Thank you
My question would be why buy a call so far out if the price is rising so quickly? Wouldnt it just be way otm at that point??
Im not taking your advice because you panic sold PLTR for a loss after FOMOing.
Lol it's tough man. You really need brass balls for this shit haha
Hell yea, nice play
There was a huge buy wall that kept it going up.  I'm fairness, they have an existing product and revenue so I am surprised it isn't $6.
Double up on the current DIP?
F
Thanks mate, I am feeling slightly better, but still can't help I missed a once in a lifetime opportunity. I hope there will be another chance where I will feel confident. I need a break from all this. I appreciate your help.
Same stock ?
Ohh so early:00 thanks
[deleted]
When did you place your CC sell? 

Thanks - I'm learning the timing of it all
Also, if I just hold and exercise at expiry I shouldnt actually be losing much right regardless of bid/ask cause Im just getting the 100 shares at 10$
500 profit is good man. Good stuff
Word.
Hopefully you take them profits and buy 100 shares of something my guy. Its a good feeling selling extremely overpriced weeklies to retards on this sub
Bro you can literally play on margin and with 875 I can get close to $4000 in MSFT stock. Look at how the money moves. This shit your looking at is our BS
Nah I mean anyone still in it at that pointbis a fucking clown 

Not to mention I'll be short minimum 200 shares within the next 1-2 weeks lol, I do like making money
Upvote for dongus  just outed yourself as a 13 y.o. girl

If it doesn't, I'll use those skills instead.
Beleive it of not. I would like some tendies.

Sir, this is a casino
carry on we deserve it..
Damn bro thats some gyna retard strength there!  All shit talking aside I hope you make some tendies!

Correct, sorry. I keep forgetting that market is open a few hours on Friday.
Clearly you are, calling me a fuck boy because you have the reading comprehension of a brick.
Prescribed 50 MG of vyvanse here. The comeup is amazing and it has changed my life. I do software sales and I am already at my quota and I just started. I cant imagine being high trying to do work, I am too unproductive. I also have got in the best shape of my life by cutting down on junk food.
Dude that's nuts, congrats!
Appreciate the sound advice and opinion, thanks!
Charge Dodger.
Microvast.com? Looks decent to me, but I'm not a website expert
Yeah I know that. Im trying to see if its worth it.
Got it thank you!
Thank you. Tesla took my last daytrade with Mondays run up
Thank you again. Its starting to move up and you suggestion really will save me if it dumps. Much appreciation
For sure thanks! Ill put it in now
GL 
I sold my turkey to buy more PLTR calls. Thanksgiving is canceled, inform the president.
Right... I'll sit it out tks
Nice, I was eyeing up FSR. If it can dodge this bloodbath I think I like it.

I'm actually short 180 shares of XPEV, and about 30 of NIO/CRSR. I hate buying puts into 100% IV lol
Fuck money but this thread has devolved so much the only thing anyone cares about is pltr like wtf
I don't even want to make money on pltr because I would feel gay. Just stop spamming your pltr hymnes
Yea Im down like 1.5K in two days on it so not gonna sell but damn I dont even think they make money yet
Thank you sir ;)
Yup along with SpaceX 
Yeah youre right.. Ive been struggling for a while. Thanks for the kindness and I hope you have a great life
25 calls are worth more as they are closer to the money.  

If 29 calls get called away, your 25 calls will be used as collateral.  Im retarded so dont take my words literally.
good to hear, Im cemented on this, riding this wave for sure
My name is Sam.
Already planning to work remote with zero fucks given. Studying comp sci to fund my trading lol
Lmao
Looking not too bad
Na you just sound like a little snitch bitch
Good shit man, take the day off
Good deal! Thanks for the info, and congrats!
Fuckkkk thats deadly, congrats. I got a shitty fill so my calls are down 90% but Im not playing big money like you
I think youre right but you also have to look at the fact that its extremely oversold I do agree though that BABA investors tend to have the sell button ready
fuck it im retarded
Real talk. Good on you, thanks! 

I'm working on getting that paperMoney thing to work on Mac, but anything else I should look into?
That's almost 3 of PLTR. Which could be a decent toe dip. But I wouldn't know when to sell it off, either.
Oh wtff
Me either Im mainly just watching from the sidelines, not at that capital level yet
Dude I know what the fuck good for you man get them gains
I'm in monthlies hoping for more retarded strikes to come up. Then I'm going all in on calls for June 2021. TTD HAS to make a move and they'll buy them out straight up
Cool 
Its a very reasonably argument and I like your point about the infotainment systems. Here in the US, at least where I am located, it seems that Tesla is the only EV option so it is possible that is coloring my perceptions. I would not be surprised that some of these EV start ups hang around and become successful, but I think its highly unlikely that even a majority do. I think its still a risky bet to go in on them...that doesnt mean its a bad idea but I see too many people thinking that they are all going to keep growing until they are VW or GM.
Yeah Ive had some for a few weeks
Oh yeah I fucked up on PLUG myself. I had 250 shares at $3 a share.
Shares Is the way to go in my opinion. I treat my options like lottery tickets. Watch a couple YouTube videos and that should give you a basic idea and from there just experimenting with small amounts im willing to lose.
Do you think the price of any calls will be a bit cheaper towards end?

Thanks, you too man. 
This week has been so good. I honestly hope everyone makes money. Fuck all these hedge fund manager fat cats having aneurysms because we're making money.
And that's the part I don't understand. You are quite literally saving lives, but your pay doesn't reflect it. I hope that gets rectified sometime soon.
Honestly I just buy shit lol. I pay attention to IV but thats about it
No. All non-domestic markets add up to 10% of revenue. This includes markets like Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam where Lazada (wholly owned) and TMall are big.

They never had good penetration in India.

India news is just them taking stronger stance of locking both Chinese and American multi-nationals out of their local market.
Tbh I just dont fuck with Chinese stocks I dont want anything to do with the CCP. Good luck tho Im a fan of EVs in general so time will tell
Hahah good for you bro welcome home
I got in at like 40-42 on the shares? So the morning has been rough. And it was 3.20 for the call when I bought it. Lost over 300 this morning but it looks like the recovering is starting
I bought a little yesterday and then I dropped way more today when it had a slight dip. Maybe it will hit 40 by Christmas man
Yeah, I do t know exactly what time it happens in the morning.  But last time I did it with TD pdt was lifted when I got up at 8am
Okay, keep your secrets man!
Brah I know it can't be so bad. Sure it feels that way now but you know it's a phase
RemindMe! 3 weeks
Lets hope you can get that PS5
Yup!
So you are not naked, if I understand you have 30 and 31 calls, these calls are superior to 32 calls. So when you sell two 32 calls, one of them is hedged with 30 and one is with 31. So if the stocks decides to go higher, your 30 and 31 calls will always be values higher then the 32 calls. You can close out this position on Friday by doing the opposite and avoiding day trading restriction.
my current side hustle is buying sealed Pokemon booster boxes

I just wait a year and then re-sell them for a lot more

silly appreciation on those these days
hell yeah brother
Merci
Yeah I just did the free upgrade the other night, I do kinda like the level 2 market data, so I honestly might keep it
Bro, was on board long ago. Just tryna let my CCs expire worthless 
I don't think it will be flat this week...may not take long to go up today itself
12/31
I'll take 10% for the tip. Got another 4 bagger if you're interested.
Too big to the us govt to fail. Only not profitable because of share comp. its a great company- people worried about ice contracts dont understand how entangled their system is with govt agencies. Literally not allowed to go tits up
Still in a decent spot brother hold those
You're correct, it's like any other stock. There's some decent dd on here explaining why it it is unlikely to drop below $20 before the merger:

Ah ok just wanted to make sure we were on the same page.

Because in the market I trade, that is primed for an amazing run to an irrational valuation. 

In a sane world, those might be terrible things to have on a track record though. If the world ever goes sane, lots of things will change.
Oh I completely agree. I'll sit cash.

I think we see ZM sub $200 Eventually and it won't be all overnight
Yeah its all a learning experience. The feeling of missing out on a little bit of gains is much better than the feeling of burning your tendies and watching profits disappear completely tho. Ive had it both ways and its brutal to see how much you could have made if only you werent greedy. Its said all the time but very true: you cant ever go broke taking a profit
Buy MGNI 25c June 21. Free money
Yes.
Haha yeah it's so strange to me too
Then don't regret, be proud of it and go have a nice meal
True. But this account is just play money going for 10 baggers. Still think PLTR is gonna come tumbling back down below $20 but we'll see I guess
normally a year+ some people say 9 months but a year is more official

Im up 52% on the Jan 2023 $10 leaps I bought last Thursday, its nice not really having to care about expirations.
Thanks, I actually really appreciate that!
Nice Analysis I appreciate it
Oh lol thought you meant writing calls. I don't really understand day trading tbh
Salesforce has a massive customer base for its CRM tool

My company (~$100mm annual revs) is looking to convert our CRM to Salesforce this year

I agree PLTR over time should be a bigger company, but CRM's addressable market is MUCH bigger
Yea man god knows what Im doing but Im looking for a quick $200 not 200% haha
If its successful, I have no idea, space flight is hot.
Buyers are good for business. Im not selling anytime soon
ICD gang where you at
imo I think the upside is 70 in the next 3 months, but think about how many better trades you can find in 3 months. If you ask anyone why they think the price should be what it is or lower or higher, you're not going to get an answer even grounded in valuation. That scares me off.

disclosure: I had shares from sub $3 sold at $18, got back in at $33 got out at $48, and started shorting at $50.
Still?
its a bubble, everyones been saying it. momentum chasers always have the biggest gains but also the biggest losses
Youre not gonna see profits this week, but theyre long dated so youre gonna be alright
Lol you need to raise your trash talk.. just like you need to raise your analysing skills.

Retard
Damn, that is a deal. Youve sold me on it, internet stranger.
Yeah good shout its had a pretty good run recently. Plus markets due a pullback soon
Give me one so I don't have to think
I dropped $10k in shares. Up 65% so far. Obviously wish I would've went with calls but who tf thought this would pop this quick. I was expecting a moderate but steady climb. My paper handed ass probably would've sold even if I did have calls. Holding my shares though until at least December. Might wait for the inevitable pullback and buy back in. Really like the company from an investment standpoint but this run up seems unsustainable.
Nice bro, good shit. I think it's good you took some of your profits man this valuation is pretty high for CRSR even though I do believe it's a great company
Ah i see
Weekly puts bleeding premium, so far up 10k on the sale
Yea me too... greed still high, dollar making potential bounce, shits wild
If you got in a couple weeks ago, you probably bought around $10. Solid entry point for a long term hold.
looks like its going to retest $42 at this point and then run, yeah after Thanksgiving and all next week. Just hurts cause it didn't have to drop that much in a single day. :/
Lately, yeah.

It was within the last few months that SPACs all took a huge shit tho
Hey man, I apologize for being so hostile. You were right, just been burned too many times by people in here lol hope your trading session is going well
Not that I know of. I created the account with only 2k USD, and lied about everything about liquidation and assets. But I still got an options permission
i have shares.....lmao
Glad ur not as retarded as your other  brothers
I already have buyers remorse!
I dont know what otm and itm is I only play with shares 
It was at 273 and is now at 276.... seems like its rising to me
Deff early, but he was hoping for a few Billion dollar investment from tesla as a lotto too lol.... but the DD and diamond hands paid off I wonder where he's at now?
How could he possibly be down 40%?
Nice bro! Make that money
[deleted]
Lol yeah don't use it on a work computer. If you open the watchlist tab there is a "browse category" that lists a bunch of pre configured watchlists
np enjoy the watch! if you like the actor also check out a history of violence. Same guy in both and I believe he was in LOTR as well. A history of violence is more of a cerebral thriller though but still amazing work.
Yeah I hear ya. I just rolled up and over a large one yesterday, secured some profits but now its down bigly.

Just be patient. You got plenty of time still if its a 12/18 one
Why hold a long term play when you can fomo into pltr today? Thats the thinking in this sub. Hold for a week or two and if it doesnt move, sell it. Or sell today. Its all a gamble either way.
Looking at vix over 5 days its still deeply red. Thats why Im kinda confused
ohh okay, thank you sir. does this also mean people are becoming more "fearful"?
Are you deaf???

19! Before its too late!
Where are you getting FANG being half what is was pre covid? All of those stocks have raised significantly since Feb. Hence why they probably wont move much in the coming weeks imo
I had 2 jan calls. Sold one yesterday and letting one ride
expiration date has nothing to do with the money-ness. you can buy ITM LEAPS for 2023 if you want. that premium is gonna be a motherfucker tho
I made a big mistake . I did that because of the above assumption I made
Im down,  meet you here at 3.  Hope youve got 6 figures or we cant beef.
I sold yesterday EOD. Based on the short rest of the trading week, the theta will be destroyed by Friday.
Yep correct! Bid/ask is only relevant if you don't wanna put up the capital to exercise, if you're gonna exercise then no issues at all and you avoid all the time decay nonsense too
and to your 5k lol!
Im just trolling with you.  Best of luck to you.
Get fucked you absolute dink, get your anus absolutely rammed by my pltr cock you fucking mongaloid.
Same to you! Be it american or chinchins, its all good.
Yea you mad boy ;)
Wow good for you man, thats awesome.

Im 20 years old at a solid university and I tried vyvanse for the first time last year.

Every time I take it I am a fucking beast. Can literally grind for hours at a time and am easily the best version of myself on it.

I only take it when I really need it because I am not prescribed, but I really feel like taking it consistently would permanently change my life too
Thanks! Have been playing with some investing money the last few years, and its definitely the first time Ive done this well
Brooklyn Dodger
imo if you lost everything and it wouldnt hurt you financially, then okc margin may be ok. but if you are risking money you need then no
[deleted]
Youre welcome and appreciate the gold! Glad I could help someone out. Ive been burned too many times bag holding calls so would hate for it to happen to someone else.  God speed.
Also go Rockets baby ! One of these days well get a championship while Im alive...
Maybe I'll catch a break and everyone scared of the Chinese EV companies pump their money into an American one today!


Good call on the shorts. Looks like it'll pay off nicely today.
We are all in this together brother. It's Thanksgiving, I want you to think about at least one thing that you are truly thankful for.

And please go here: https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/
Oh ok. That helps. Thanks again! Just trying to understand the logistics of all this. Have a great day!
Good call. I do Manufacturing and am trying to convince my boomer bosses that I can write the software to make things work remotely and only need to come in to test it like once a week.
Nah, just tired of these dumbasses posting the same p&d all day every day. If everyone did this with every ticker, we're just stocktwits with memes.
Holy fuck im rich
After that dude, just read. Theres a LOT of info. Learn about Greeks and how option prices move with the market. Then learn about calls and puts. Spreads all kinds of stuff. TD is renowned as one of the best education sections among brokers. 

Know that when you open an account you will have a real money account, but you dont have to fund it yet. And that if you do use the money account you will pay commission.
Im up 100% on my long term investments. You dont have to sell it for years if you get shares.
Yea here in the UK, youll only ever see electric cars in big cities (London mainly) or when driving on the motorway (highway) and even then youre more likely to not see an electric car. Id say Teslas still dominate the EV scene here but only for the very well off. 

I think public perception may change but agreed in that most of these EVs will never become a GM or VAG group, I think the age of massive conglomerates in the auto industry is going to live and die with the current ones. Itll be interesting to see what kinds of EVs the current auto giants come out with and how these new EVs compete with them. Were still a good 5 years away from good enough alternatives that can match price, performance, and range, not to mention the surrounding infrastructure. 

Thanks for the discussion!
Oh yikes. Glad I built up a position of 100 around $15 right before this pump
Uh, with the current volume? No. But if youre going to look for a reinvestment period, eyeball February. Its when their lockout expires, aka when people paid in stock can start unloading their shares. Who knows how that will move it, depends on how much is unloaded. 

The proletariat rises when the information is shared brother. Fuck Wall Street.
HAHA love it. Same I just press some buttons but trying to learn more everyday
thanks!
yeah it got lifted immediately. what an amazing day
I failed at life already, and gonna miss out on the biggest opportunity of my life in this crazy free money market, then Ill die a disappointing failed loser of what couldve been 
Nice. I was up 230% got out at 109%:( but still profited and thats all that matters
Thats good. The instant transfer seems really helpful. Fuck it Ill do it its 30 days. Best of luck to you!
FUCKIN AWESOME!
I'm in 60 contracts now. Fuck it YOLO. Yessir more bags pls
Fisker didnt pop with every other EV, I doubt its going to pop now, but sure, it could.
I dont know what any of that means
oh nah nah nah. If im just buying and selling shit i cant end up owing more than i put in, right?
only usuable answer lmao, thanks
yea, forget pm noise, lets see what happens at open. when it tries to get back above 23.
EVs will not go anywhere, so nothings momentum about that. But this is not the way to do it lol
Lets meet back when Nokia pops and pick out lambo colors.
>FSLR 

 FSLR
regret selling that call now, lol

Edit: happy thanksgiving to you & your fam tomorrow!
lmao ya ok sure everyone believes you

FUCKKKK my order didn't fill to close out and this shit shot up
Yeah this is brutal but youre right in the long term theyre fucking solid
Because the gains were absurd lol (200%+). That doesnt take away from what they are.
All good mate you too
Sweet man thx . Totally radicle
Lol pussy go back to /r/stocks and /r/investing
It basically means the bet (put or call) was correct
u/ExtraEgg ? How you looking bro! Where's the next play?
prolly 700k, he had a milly at the tippy top
I feel bro. This market does not reward reason or rationale. Def go with it.
Its a 12/18 but I though today was the day. We were cruising now its an uphill battle
The RSI has reset to a healthy position but it would have shown when to exit the call at the top. People are just chilling waiting for turkey
 Bro. Fang. The literal ticker lol.
I have more studying to do apparently 
I have no day trades left and just bought a PLTR call 12/4 25c do you think I'll be okay by then since the market is closed tomorrow? I mean I could see a dip but PLTR seems pretty damn strong... Don't mean to bother you just looking for a little advice. Thanks
Makes sense thanks man

I get you. Fuck it Ill opt out its not a necessity for me tbh
The best DD
 Oddly enough, I learned about this from the sub. A St0mi post brought it to my attention.
USA baby 

FSR leap lookin good to me now
Im thankful for my family because they never give up on me. And Im thankful for you caring enough to say something. Godspeed and I hope you are blessed with infinite tendies bro
Lol good luck with that. Idk why boomers are so against wfh
u got shares or calls
Thanks! I have Robinhood with a couple bucks ($2 of free stocks when I first signed up is now $34 haha) and I have buy and hold in my M1 account, with just VTI.
Shares as opposed to fractional shares?
Im definitely excited to see where the competition goes. Good luck!
Thanks for all the info. Trade on man.

Happy Thanksgiving!
Yea Im a jackass but learning how delta works for spreads would probably help a lot
Dood I've lost 15k at one point when everyone and their dog was making money. Don't let this gambling game decide your mood and outlook on life. If you just play this game long enough you'll see that sometimes being utterly idiotic can make you a truck of money. 

That's what's happening with PLTR and NIO now for example. I've made quite a bit from NIO but tbh I don't really understand a lot. I brought PLTR at IPO and then sold it at a loss. If I had just held 2 months I'd be fucking rich. But that's the game. 

You win some and lose some my dude. Don't let this game affect your mood and outlook. That's the stupidest thing you can do.  

Van Gogh, the founder of modern art, didn't start to paint until he was 28. Think about that
Yeah I feel you, profit is profit. If I would have held for 15 minutes longer I would have gotten another $10k, but then 15 after that its back again. Crazy stuff
Same brotha!
I'll send it over after your PLTR play. See you on Friday. 5 bagger for you my dude
Look up MGNI. Buy calls. Make money
That's true. There's some kind of regulation about buying and selling on the same day though iirc I usually hold for at least a day so I have no idea
Are you going to sell calls as well?
> FSLR

Done
Thanks brother, I'm from London so we don't really celebrate thanksgiving here but still forever grateful.

Enjoy the holiday !
Yea fuck that, that sucks. Hopefully a short covering and about to dump
I think thats what it was look at that 250K sell volume
Thank you man i appreciate it lol Listen to their earnings call, check out their investors relations on their page and you see this is a solid long term play. 

Lambos soon
get a life loser & l2read
Ah got it so MMs can fuck the call holders over by letting them go otm meaning they dont print and holder gets screwed? How would shares be affected
I read this thread and a tear rolled down my fucking eyes
Fuk i am retarded. Yes probably a good buy and hold for sure
You're smart to buy it ITM, good amount of space until expiration. Unless it's deep in the money I'd look to sell it by Wednesday next week. I do expect a consolidation probably Friday, the stock is overextended on every timeframe, but that consolidation is probably just 2 or 3$ max, like what we saw on the 24th. I'm playing shares and selling calls.

Yeah Im pretty shocked it hasnt caught on especially considering all the SPAC hype these days...
Calls
didnt read, shotgun to head at 21
Do you plan on playing it Friday?
Should I turn on margin or continue without when I start my free trial?
Love you bro!
no calls Im Eurofag 

stocks any good?
No
I really like how this conversation went, it went from you wanting to dick my mom to you taking investment advice from me xD never underestimate /r/wallstreetbets
Yeah bro some people dont even know that they own Elgato/scuf and dont really understand its potential as an esports/streamer play. See you yacht week in Croatia 
Exactly. Shares wouldnt be affected so long as they arent overvalued to begin with, if you just hold they will rise again
Haha its okay. I did the same thing when I saw it then realized what it was. I bought a call this morning just for the fuck of it. Up 25 percent so far.
Thank you! Literally my first option purchase ever lol. Sounds like I'm in decent shape. I'll target that Wednesday date and just keep an eye on it until then. Thanks again for the advice and response. Cheers!
Court approval! BANG!!!! LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!
im gonnna kill myself
I don't know why you think death would neutralize or make it all okay. It's worse than nothing. We'd be one fewer among those who know how life can be.
Not a 0dte mostly bc I use Robinhood and they dont allow buying and selling 0dte. Im only almost back to even on my account after a rough month (was down $18k, made back $16k this week), so I might take a few days and The Weekend to plan my next move.
Actually Jk ived moved over into yoloing that $20k into amazon 12/24 3300C
I have it turned off. I just dont see it as worth it? But read up on it yourself, if you like the terms and conditions then thats your call
I love you too bro. Let's make this Christmas one to remember. Damn the MMs. It's our turn!
Get TastyTrade or IBKR and get into options
I still want to dick her, this is just my way in.
If I had money to give you awards I would lol we got this man, hold strong and I'll meet you there lol
This will be an unpopular opinion here, but I'm big on risk management. If you are already up on the call, consider a stop loss. If you're a new trader, most important thing to learn is risk management and capital preservation. That's why you see so many ppl here blowing up accounts. You can still wallstreet 'bet' but do it semi responsibly. I'd bet the majority of people who have been here for more than 2 years practice some form of risk management.
Aye well I hope it goes wayyyy up, Ive only got in like 50 shares at $17.50 but from what Ive read its gonna GOOOO !
cause I wouldnt be here I never wanted to be here piece of shit parents
Yeah Im still looking into it
Yes!
Ok you need to go pump JMIA for that
Lmao motherfuckers out here thinking they compare to logitech... see you there bring some whiskey
Sounds smart. No reason you can't be aggressive AND smart / strategic at the same time... The pattern day trade thing prevents me from doing this atm but I will be sure to enter a stop loss as soon as I can. Probably have to wait until Thursday for it to go through. I agree with you man, if you YOLO enough times in a row it seems like eventually you'll get burned...
I understand how it would all be okay if you didn't exist at all. But now that you exist, it doesn't make sense to just die. World is giant a machine and you can't pull a wire and have it go back to normal. A lot of very inspiring and positive things you're still capable of.
For me...dealing with interest and having to repay back the margin and all that, just seemed way too complicated. I mean, shit. Trying to pick winners is hard enough. Hard pass on Margin
Hold this is the play my dude.
I need to verify your investment advice credentials. I need your mom's number so I can make sure you're not an idiot
Ctfuuuu irl They don;t know shitt lol I give is 5 months or less and they'll surpass them in marketcap. Mark these words and i'll be riding these calls and shares to saturn right with you. and sounds good. top shelf only
sui at 21, only 8 months to go
Okay thank you! Ill opt out
Hold til friday? I really don't want a stressful thanksgiving wondering about it... I'm up 8k rn lol
Hold. I'm telling you. If you don't want to stress, sell EOD at 31 but comeback in and buy 0DTE PLTR 32c 11/27 on Friday.
