If GME can bust through 19.20 it makes 19.21 very likely
A little bit of PLTR in my life

A little bit of TSLA by my side

A little bit of GME is all I need

A little bit of Green is what I see

A little bit of ACB in the sun

A little bit of Futures all night long

A little bit of tendies, here I am

A little bit of you makes me your man.

Knights of PLTR form up to retake 30! 
Due to financial reasons, I will be passing away.
Time for our daily prayer:

Our calls, Who art in PLTR,

Perfect be Thy Timing.

Thy tendies come.

Thy expirations be done,

on earth as it is in Wall Street.



Give us this day our daily Lambos.

And forgive us of our puts,

as we forgive those who buy puts against us.

And lead us not into Debt,

but deliver us unto tendies. Amen

In March I spent 1 hour thinking about a $200  buy.
Last chance to buy GME before 50% gap up tomorrow
PLTR just trying to shake the last of the scared money out before  resumes tomorrow.  Don't quote me on this.
Put aside the squeeze, GME stocks are a pretty safe bet considering they're undervalued and sell online AND retail, vaccine news shouldn't affect them. All in.
PLTR 34 EOD? Already up over 3% ~$1 prematket.

This stock is going to be $50 per share by the end of 2021.

PLTR down, NIO down, CrSR down...the street of broken memes.
I bought 2000 shares of PLTR at $25 so you fucks better keep buying and never let me see red on this trade.
# IF we'd all agree to buy 100 shares of GME each that'd be great.
PLTR developed AI used to drone strike bearrorists
This sub is trying to pump PLTR off a rumor while also claiming that its not a pump and dump. The cognitive dissonance amazes me.
What matters is that we all had fun.

Godspeed to whoever bought them.
PLTR going to be $30 10 minutes into market
Palantards ASSEMBLE!!!!
Bought GME at top like a retard. 
PLTR share/call holders this is a moment that tests your discipline. If youre an infantile crack head addicted to porn who panics at the smallest of inconveniences, you will sell. If youre a true alpha male who gets laid 7 times a week, youll hold. Choice is yours.

Imagine selling PLTR earlier  remember to always hold.

hope PaLTR helps a brother out today.
TSLA 600 & beyond!
GME GANG 
Last time on PLTR Z, PLTR was powering up to 9000 when Andrew Left used Citron cuck-short on PLTR. Will PLTR survived? Find out at opening bell

CNBCS BIGGEST PRE-MARKET MOVERS:

NKLA: The EV maker lost the contract to pave former CEO Trevor Miltons driveway, reducing revenues by 100%.

PSTH: The blank-check SPAC is up 8% because sources say why the fuck not?

PLTR: Insiders have indicated the company has decided to stop mooning everyday and instead raise by a quiet 3% weekly until it gets re-recognized as a meme at $100 when its too late to make any profit on it.
TSLA should buy NKLA and turn it into a energy drinks & snacks company.
Buying more pltr at opening! Shit's gonna explode!

Hey boys, markets are crazy rn. Take a breather, drink some water and call your mom, she will appreciate it and you wont have her around forever.
Just put 10k into GME. Still trying to figure out why. 
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BULLSHIT PLTR 

YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!!!
75% of this sub is getting wiped out in a single day. RIP fs in the chat
what are you doing step-market?
WSB when PLTR goes up 20% in one day: strap in boys were going up another 200%

WSB when PLTR is down 9% intraday: The end of time is nigh. Sell everything

Fucking retards.
It's a red mirage, the mail in buys are being counted now
Comrades! I have 8 calls that say PLTR is getting to 40. 

Laughing my ass off seeing people believe that a bunch of retards with 1k accounts are moving the PLTR price.

The only reason I didn't panic sell pltr is because I went back to sleep and just woke up now
If every member here bought GME right now, we could initiate the short much faster and fuck over those gay hedge funds who are betting against us
Volume on PLTR is insane!!!

Id be very happy if GME ends above 18
PLTR new stable coin pegged at $27
If you think we arent going up on GME you must be blind or in denial from PLTR . Not only has the WSB special autist class agreed to buy GME stock in bulk orders, but the senior autists at GME stocktwits are on the same page. Buy wait theres more, the imbeciles at Webull GME chat also have the same agenda. This is like when the power ranges link up to defeat mojojojo or any other antagonist.

Oh look all the PLTR gay bear's disappeared again. Weird.
Every time the market takes a dip all the gay bears come out in WSB and make pretend the market is free falling and they are the only ones who saw it coming.  When market goes back up you dont hear a word from them.   
In every interview with Alex Karl (pltr). He always brings up contracts and things the company is doing that he cant talk about. I wonder if they are even allowed to report some project financially due to thier sensitivity
GME ready for launch
If PLTR goes green Alex Karp can say n word


Edit: sudden 30c increase wow
Damn this GME is some really great shit, wish I'd gotten hooked on it sooner
Just finished buying 6K GME shares lesss goooo 
GME ALMOST READY FOR TAKE OFF, 20 EOD
GME squeeze on the daily

GME for life. Grew up wasting all my money there some things never change..
PLTR will be $30 EOD
GME everyone, HOP THE FUCK ON THIS TRAIN
I love the movement on PLTR, very good for my blood pressure
If GME stays elevated, the shorts will have to cover soon. They can't be short forever. Buy shares, sell calls ATM. easy 10% gain if you hold a week.
The great WSB vs Citron war will be written in financial history books.
Pltr isnt even really a meme stock if you think about it. IV is up but long term this shit is really going to be running , careful with weeklies though
Ive gone from down $1100 today to down $63.14
Pltr needs to be like 30. So much hype wtf is this
for real, THC dip rn is so tasty. Im eating the shit out of it, dw boys!
Bought sundial at the top AMA
My biggest mistake every day is trying to immediately flip profits to a new play.  I have to remember it's okay to cash out and just wait until the next play reveals itself.  Also 
Is Pltr gonna make a comeback?
Imagining begging for a PLTR dip to get in and then not taking advantage of it because some cuck wrote a salty report
CRSR to the  again. If this crashes Im a pathetic loser and will leave the market having lost all my gains cause of greed
God dammit boys, I panic sold everything I could at about 10:35 EST. I'm a fucking retard
GME Volume so fucking low, fucking buy

GME 20 EOD? Then huge spike AH to 30

GME cock slowly rising as we approach power hour. PROUD BULLS, stand by

"General Motors and Nikola on Monday announced a reworked, smaller agreement that keeps the fuel-cell partnership intact but eliminates an equity stake in the startup for the Detroit automaker as well as plans for building Nikolas electric pickup truck."

Pretty sure that's GM's way of trying to save face and get the fuck outta here

Folks  - be mindful about giving any advice that could be considered financial  advice to a minor. Perfect honey trap set up for SEC to pull down WSB.

As for your question, surely an ETF would be safer for someone your age.

Imagine panic selling your PLTR calls this morning
If you sold any of your PLTR position today you dont deserve a place in Valhalla
Im too much of a pussy to look. Hows PLTR lookin?

Big tech week. I feel it.
APEXT is going to print today boys!!!! Bought in at 14  and sitting 16  pre market!!!

Looking at GME in premarket just makes me wonder how high DeepFuckingValue's account is right now
The fomo on GME at open is going to be insane.  Better get in now in AH at 17.

Vaccine pumps 4 mondays in a row? They can't keep getting away with it
lol NKLA really got pumped and dumped pre market huh? Just like good ol' times.
GM will not take stake in NKLA 
We all worked hard overnight to make sure the europoors didn't dump PLTR, now it's our turn to return the favor!
\*\*Furiously rubbing TSLA medallion to keep it above 600\*\*
DETROIT, Nov 30 (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Nikola Corp on Monday announced a reworked, smaller agreement that keeps a fuel-cell partnership intact but eliminates an equity stake in the startup for the Detroit automaker as well as plans for building Nikola's electric pickup truck.

So GM is basically slowly extricating themselves from this car crash of a company...
It's only gonna take a little push for GME to go parabolic
I ate nothing but meat and cheese yesterday so the log I just passed slowly maneuvered out of me like a giant barge carrying coal down the Cuyahoga River.  
  
Happy vaccine Monday!
Yo, Tesla just bought me a Cybertruck. I'm preordering after the market close and I convert to cash gang.
Holy shit are the GME FDs i got Friday trying to print?

Buying more palantir now, the only way to lose money in this market is selling to early
If you get nervous on a day like this where the whole market is down a bit, you need to stop trading.
Do not dump PLTR it will go back up
I thought for sure the road to wealth was built by listening to internet strangers begging me to buy random internet stock #67488 with 4 pages of rocket emojis. Why are my calls going down???????
Bought at the top 
Buy the dip retards. It's an overall red day anyways. Take advantage.
hold palantir queers, hold.
I think I figured out the problem: The line should be going up instead of down
Friday WSB: Institutions, suck our cocks! Were the captains now! HA HA HA!!!! 
Monday morning WSB: Listening to you retards I lost my savings. Fuck this manipulated market. I quit.
I'm just glad PLTR isn't every other comment anymore
Yo, I waited like 3.5 days for this shit?

Is there anything more terrifying that watching yourself leverage your life savings 4x on a free app. See you're up $800 happy as can be. Try to close the short and the app says that you have open orders

But no open orders to be found

*bam 
Price goes back up +$800 to -$1000 real fast.


Panick sets in. 

Price goes back to my entry price. Bail at $0 minus a few dollars in fees.


Man fuck
Went from up $10k to down $20k and now down $3k since open.  What a wild morning.
PLTR back from the depths of hell. Hope you bois didnt toilet paper hand this one.

AAPL finally starting to make a move or what?
Im ready for $TSLA to hit $1000 again 
Gme ready to blast off
I still dont know why GME is mooning but Im gonna pretend that I do.
I can tell I am well diversified as I have some stocks that are shitting the bed and others that are really shitting the bed.
I thought Roblox was a fucking joke

the fuck you mean they have 150 million monthly active users, is there any game even close to that
Doubled down on the   buy in now and you will get at least 60% returns with minimal downside.
APHA $$$
APHA is a fucking money printer this is the next meme boys

Rolled all that PLTR to APHA thanks to WSB. Shaping up to another great week. 1000 dollars a day makes the day job go away.
Oh y'all buying literal pennystocks now?
Come on PLTR consolidate and break through $30.
We break $30 were getting to $40 boys.
The plan is simple: Hold GME until it makes my peepee hard
Stop fucking selling GME
The best part about being poor and working 2 jobs is that my pay periods alternate so I get checks every week, meaning weekly stimulus for my account
PLTR so strong, big strong erection
 **CRSR CONNNECCTTTTTTT**
My average cost for CRSR is $21.11 but I only bought 1 share. Thats what happens when you try to watch a hundred different stocks everyday.

Just got off the phone with the CEO of SPY he said he slept in late by accident but we will go to ATH tomorrow to make up for it
Today at 5:15pm S&P is going to decide if they are adding tsla all at once or splitting it into 2 days. Which would be the first time in history. 

This is because TSLA market cap is so huge. It never happened before so who knows what happens
CRSR raised full year revenue guidance as well as earnings. 
Apha new meme boys

Whos old enough to remember when oil was negative? That felt like 5 years ago
Imagine buying shares in a failing brick and mortar retail store that's been barely hanging on for the last decade and who's entire business model of selling physical copies of video games is unsustainable in a world where everyone just downloads their games.

Just got off the phone with Tim AAPL. He said 150 EOY f da bears!

Thic slow and steady men, slow and steady
WTF WHY MY STOCK GO DOWN???
ouch theta burn on PLTR is real
Im gonna take a wild guess and say PLTR ends the day at 27.00
In case yall GME FOMO dudes didnt know, most GME gains happen during AH, slight pump during open then fade throughout the day.

 Theres barely any buying pressure post 12pm so take a chill pill
GME gang will never work since you monkeys sell at the first sign of red.
This TSLA movement screams AH jump lol.
Holy christ just ring the fucking bell
PLTR squeaking in the 1-minute, 1.1-million volume push into close--I'll take whatever I can get.
PLTR going to moon today 
Morning fellow earthling. This is your local travel announcement. Guests flying to the moon board at station NIO, the shuttle arrives in 2 hours. Those traveling to Mars PLTR is your boarding pass and will begin in 2 hours. Load up the  because this is a one way ticket. Enjoy your stay.
PLTR 
PLTR  
Im seeing a lot of  with weak hands saying PLTR is over. Fuck of bears, PLTR to the moon  BUY THE DIP
$PLTR GANG $40 EOW I'LL EAT MY OWN KITCHEN TABLE
You guys need to understand that after a stock like PLTR TRIPLES in a matter of weeks, a slight pullback and consolidation is very bullish. 

Look at the massive volume it's still seeing and we're not getting a massive sell-off.
Upvote if retarded
PLTR WONT DIE
PLTR premarket isn't exactly inspiring confidence
PLTR   ready to blast off again. Hurry if you like money
Upvote for PLTR. Ignore/downvote for NKLA
Oh lawd they squeezing GME again
Sending prayers to PLTR bois
i took out a 20k loan at 35% interest to buy palantir this morning because you guys said it would go up
If you panic sold PLTR, youre a fuckin donkey
PLTR went from $29 to $24 in like an hour lmao. This is like the clash of the retard titans.
GME is now officially my biggest holding 


Why is PLTR down I thought +20% per day was a sustainable pace for a stock
Apex predators bout to be in Tendie town
Get in loser, were going to the moon.
Boomer stocks shitting themselves but tech is holding strong
Shitron GME tweet this week?
GME is making big moves today already.
THIC WHAT R U DOIN BB GIRL WRONG WAY
Morning tards...
GME gonna test out how many paper hands are in this sub
reminder GME premarket volume is just 100k shares... that's not much and doesn't indicate market movement later in the day.
BYND DKNG AAPL PLTR
So GME dropping pre-market giving us a good entry once market opens?
Holy fuck just checked GME after afk for 30 mins and wtf
Just waiting for Citron to shit all over GME now. They just pick WSB memes.
Do I buy 6000 shares of GME using margin?
Is PSTH merging with GME?!?!?!
ICLN $29 eoy?
tsla to 694.20 before consolidating again?  from 420.69 thats equivalent to $1367 pre-split move.  seems about right
Guys listen, if we all buy GME this week, we could possibly trigger the short squeeze. Dont miss out retards.
DKNG
TSLA $1000 EOY?????
How do you like my Ahegao face ?
the problem with GME is that PLTR got that end-game in mind.
FREMONT, CA, November 30, 2020  Corsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR) (Corsair), a leading global provider and innovator of high-performance gear for gamers and content creators, today announced it expects full year 2020 net revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA to exceed the expectations Corsair provided on November 10, 2020.
CRSR guidance updated to be somewhere around 10+ percent better on a number of metrics compared to their November numbers provided.

Dec 18 45C feeling more confident now.
I fucking despise Daylight saving time
Anyone here see NKLA going sub 20 again?
oh man, i was shitposting on the "what are your moves tomm" thread this whole hour. rip
Unless you post a meme ticker you get no responses or support to discuss a play.
GM just announced they're not buying into NKLA. Lmao. Bring out ya puts.
Thinking of going all in on APHA.

GME seems like a missed opportunity. The only thing I can identify holding it up is memes and potentially the upcoming EPS, but they've consistently been below the expected. So I'm torn on it. Wish I got it earlier.
Hey SPY fuck off youre not gonna ruin this APHA run
# "It's the slow meltdowns that kill you."

**- Wooly Mammoth**
BUY GME BOYOS
lmfaoo I love how reliable NKLA puts are
Im sorry, but RKT below $20 is a definite buy.  I know this stock hasnt done shit lately, but it will have its moment in the sun soon.
Honestly NKLA puts last week when they were hitting 35 was such a no brainer play I'm mad for not doing it

Then again I'm short 800 shares so I still win
Holy shit ok short NKLA ASAP
If I divorce my wife and marry this TSLA 12/24 615c everyone will understand, right?
HAHAHAHAHA, NIKOLA doing a stock offering.  JESUS H. CHRIST.  It might see 15 today.
NKLA was just a Pyramid Scheme all along 
Magic coin 19k lol
Alriiiiiiight let's hear 9:30-10:30 predictions and revert back here to see who was right and who was a fat smelly retard
At night all the gay bears come out and talk shit about beloved PLTR. In your face.
Headed to Starbucks and about to sit in my car for the next 3 hours and play with stocks!
Thinking about buying NIO leaps
**9AM LETS HAVE A GREAT DAY EVERYONE**
No matter how bad you fucked up, you can at least feel better knowing that you werent that guy that bought NKLA at $79/share.
Been bagholding NKLA puts for a couple of months waiting for December so I could reap tendies. 

Looks like Santa Claus is on his merry fucking way. 

Also, fuck Trevor. Bitch ass trick.
APHA gang, may our tendies fly as high as our consumers are 
GME really putting the team on its back

Lovely discount on PLTR, I'm going all in
Why do I always diamondhands when shit dives 20% and paperhands when shit busts 2%. I am a full retard.
Cyber Monday deals have arrived! Buy the dip.
PLTR caused market crash
Its not a pltr red day the whole market is down and you autist are panic selling. You sell now you  are a loser.
Stop bitching and start buying, pussies
I bought more puts, that was the bottom everyone. V shape recovery confirmed. 
Greed is about to fuck me again watch.

I think I have an addiction to being retarded.
I bought shares of PLTR around $15 and I will hold them for a long time, so not sweating the sell off today.   It will be north of $30 before long again.   Thinking about all those people who said they told their family members to buy PLTR on Thanksgiving though, sneering at their 'dumb boomer relatives'.   Wow.    Those people are going to get written out of the will.
Bros...
The ENTIRE market is down. Not just your precious meme stocks.

Buy low and wait for the bounce BACK UP.
Hope you fuckers bought the dip. Lets fly
Market: lol GOTTEM
Perhaps I am overleveraged.
PLTR and GME rebounding, grab your dicks
Jesus fucking Christ. I leave you alone for an hour and you tank the market
Bought GME shares at $18, Im not even mad lol this aint over
PLTR lacks the extreme retard strenght of NIO, but the meme force is strong in this one nonetheless
CLASSIC BEAR TRAP LOL I WAS NEVER WORRIED 
PLTR EOW $35 
Imagine buying PLTR puts at the daily low 
V SHAPED RECOVERY
Feel like it bodes well for GME that it's still managing to stay green today
PLTR green to red to moon.  I hope you bought the dip!!
PTLR I knew you werent gonna do me like that baby, you just wanted me to buy some more of you 
Those PLTR calls I made at the bottom looking juicy rn
Are my PXT boys still holding the line?
That was a hell of a 10:30am Monday morning pump and dump
JUST BOUGHT 5K WORTH OF PLTR SHARES. DISCOUNTED. 

HOLD AND REAP THE SPOILS. PALANTIR IS SPYING ON US NOW AND IF YOU'RE NOT INVESTED THEN YOU WILL GO TO THE GULAG
lol I hope no one panic sold PLTR
Were better than this , this is what FAGtron wants!!!
Buy the dip!!!!!
Kinda sus how NIO and PLTR literally follow each other. PLTR and NIO joint vaccine i think, 120% efficacy
panic sold my shares at the absolute bottom nice.
Is there anything more depressing than the idea of being a bear justing sitting there watching stocks moon then buying puts after SPY drops 1% only to get wiped out once again
if you didnt buy the PLTR dip stop trading.. this fucker will hit $40 mid dec
It is your 8:00 meme update, it is now 12:00 market hour with PLTR climbing up out to hell trying to reach its open while GME stays memeing safely at a solid $18. All the other stocks r irrelevant
Imagine wasting time with any DD other than "buy any dip"
So you guys complain something moons, and then when its on sale, you freak out?

Buy the dip ******
PLTR -1.85%, back from -11% holy shit.
DIAMOND HANDS PREVAIL AGAIN FUCK YOU DOLLAR STORE GIFT BAG CHEAP TISSUE PAPER HANDED BASTARDS AND FUCK YOU BEARS
Diamond hands boys. The robinhood traders are about to wake up soon and buy the fkn dip 
LMAOOOO BEARS SCREAM CIRCUT BREAKER AND SUDDENLY GET FUCKED
PLTR - Bagholding 1000 shares and 10 calls.    
I think it's gonna sin wave for a couple weeks and break out past 50 after the December deadline, or just before it. Selling calls at high strike with shares and diamond-handsing calls. It's cheap. Not a lot of downside as there are few competitors. These are the games you wanna play.
Go green PLtR
My average cost is mooning 
JPOW accidentally unplugged the router for a minute. Your regularly scheduled gains will be back in a little
I hope that was the last dip. Cuz I started buying shit 
PLTR WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
apex was green that whole time lmao. SHEEESH
PLTR puked and now its time to rally
Thank u for the pltr dip
If PLTR and TSLA finish green Im going to stare at myself in the mirror for 3 hours and laugh at myself for panic selling. Everything I sold was already up but still :(
Is GME still squeezing soon?
HOLD PLTR we are fine you fools
#WE TYPIN ALL CAPS TODAY ITS HEAVY FUCK BEARS FUCK RED DAYS TYPE BEAT

#I GOTTA GET SOME WORK DONE IM OUT   
Did Apple finally being green tank the market?
Pro-tip: if you lost money on GME calls, deposit $1k and buy GME shares.

If you need help understanding these instructions defer to every DD since 27Nov2020
The whole point of buying GME SHARES is to squeeze the fuck out of the hedge fund cunts who think they control the market. They're wrong. WSB controls the market now.
wow so it was a bull trap
Well Im going GME. Wish me luck bois
Market only up for 2 hrs why it feel like its been all day 
Bullish

TSLA did just get approved in Gyna to start selling Shanghai built Model Y's, so there's that...
DraftKings just announced deal with detroit pistons
TSLA 600 is in the rear view now.  See ya!

GME PLTR TSLA JMIA what yall think
ICLN doesnt stop.
Gme already up 10% lets go
Yo retards selling GME, do you hate money or something?
You... you retards are doing it! GME up big, hope you guys make it and aren't stuck holding bags

GME didnt tank. It was fucking 5AM premarket volatility. Thats what happens when you have a total of 25 bid-asks combined.
>See ZM rising in PM.

Yep, investors are still retarded. Nothing to see here folks.
Oh shit GM no stake in NKLA? I guess maybe do short it
This is why I shouldnt check pre-market. I aged ten years watching NKLA fuck my puts before it plummeted
RIP that guy who only owns SHOP
I'm about to go from -99% all time to -40% all time from GME lets GOOOOOO
Woke up so happy that the weekend is over
Just here reading my DD for the morning.

Breaking News: NKLA being bought out by TSLA for half a Wawa hoagie.
Invest in a good blanket. Just had the best night of sleep ever and Im feeling 10% less autistic today, which should translate to less money lost (98% down, instead of the usual)
GME option IV looking too low imo
Congrats to people holding GME, may you be blessed with tendies. Unfortunately, I missed the train this time...
APHA $9 USD BY EOD FR FR  
I am legit amazed that so many people are shocked at NKLA's drop right now. This was long overdue.
I'm fully prepared to post my loss porn if pltr dives.  But I am not prepared to sell
So these NKLA calls as a yolo... were not the move. Got it
New GM deal announced, they cut NKLA and badger out. Refunding badger deposits. Rip NKLA
Mexico approved Cannabis to be legalized on a federal level. 
Canada already legalized on a federal level. 
US is not gonna be stuck in the middle of two legalized countries for long. 

Super bullish on Weed stocks.

I kinda feel sad for the people who bought NKLA this morning when it mooned +20%

Then again, fuck NKLA and fuck them
TSLA above $600 
NKLA is this generations Enron
To those wishing the NKLA spam would end: no. This shit has paraded as a meme stock alongside the actual product-makers for too long (AMD, PLTR, ZM, TSLA). Now its time for sweet vindication for us legacy autists whove been short this shit pre-Hindenburg report.
APHA gang we eating 
Trevor Milton story debuting on Netflix winter 2021
Wait - NKLA gets a shittier deal with GM AND is doing an offering?  You gotta be fucking kidding me.  Generally I'd say fuck the SEC, but how in the hell can they let shit like this keep going on.  They don't even have a fucking product.
Went for a jog this morning and my knees and foot arch kill me everytime, Im only 21 and have strayed away from high cushion shoes which helps. Any tips, besides more pltr?

Fuck NKLA and lmao at all the retards who couldn't be parted from their money soon enough. Seriously, there are so many good companies with legitimate products totally killing it right now, and instead you choose the con man with a clear history of fraud and no product all based on a promise of some paper thin GM deal? Silver lining is you all learned you would make excellent cult members.
Nio more than likely to report their November delivery numbers this week (Probably Wed). Theyve only been doing better every month. EOW $60 LEGGO NIO DONT FORGET ABOUT DADDY

GameStop needs to roll a PS5 downhill. That should get the people going. $GME
Buyer's market after 11 or 1. This is a correction, not a crash
Remember. Its actually healthy for a stock that has been green week after week to have a red day. Easy to lose sight of that when all you care about is going to Tendietown
All those paper hands PLTR sellers will make regret posts with facepalm emojis when it hits 35 by EOW.

When people in here are asking why their options arent executing 30 min before market open then you know were at the top lmao
Time to panic sell
Cramer did this
Tomorrow's thread is going to be really, really quiet.
People telling you to buy the dip want you to buy the dip so they can get out. Here, hold this bag. I'll be back.
Fucking so tired of having gains wiped in the morning
Lesson learnt: greed is the downfall of man
What are we buying on this dip?
PLTR 23.6% fib retracement is 25.2 and 38.2% retracement is 20.4

if we break 25.2, its straight down to 20.
If PLTR doesn't rebound this week then my account is bust. Godspeed friends

Seriously those fuckers panic selling PLTR, stop being so retarded. In the long run PLTR can only grow. Thats the reality.
All I gotta say is .... PLTR
People acting like EVs aren't the future and we're just going to revert back to Ford Model Ts and Hummers that get 4 mpg because market dipped a little bit and Citron is stupid

NIO, TSLA calls
Tf is going on
PLTR deep V.

Thats the sharpest V shaped recovery Ive ever seen lol. PLTR pots are fukd
And just like that, the 100 more shares I bought of PLTR at 26 are green again
PLTR like the fucking Phoenix over here
Nothing changed. We dip everyday from 9:30-11:00 every trading day, and rip from that point forward.

Cancelled all Calls on $ROPE
PLTR playing too much
Lot of jokes on here but seriously considering buying 300 more shares of PLTR. What other high volatility stock could I dump $10,000 into if not PLTR?

Already own 500 shares of GME.
Anyone else buy the  dip under 12? I picked up another 450 shares.
From down 30% today to now up 5% this truly is a wild ride today
One red day and you guys act like the house is burning down. PULL YOUR SHIT TOGETHER! This game is not for the faint of heart.
It would be unpatriotic to NOT buy GME at 17.76.
So... PLTR to 40 by the end of the week? 
Now that all the paper handed bitches are gone lets secure these tendies boys
damn my accoutn swinging $500 every 10mins

Lol PLTR. Stocks are so dumb sometimes
Eod gme pump?
Anybody else set small daily goals/reward levels?  I set aside a small portion of my account, about $500, for daily gambling plays. Often times I make a bet with myself that if I make X amount today Ill take it out and buy this or that. 

Today its NIO. I bought two 12/4 $52c for $2.56. If I hit $300 in profit on them I am buying a new winter coat and a pair of wolf and shepherd cap-toes on this amazing Cyber Monday. 

Lets go NIO, daddy want a new pair of hybrid dress shoes that Steve Nash plays basketball in!
That was a quicker reversal on PLTR than Randy Orton delivering a RKO outta nowhere
Went from down 17k to up 2k, the V shape is real. Fs in the chat for bears that bought puts at the bottom
Realistic outlook on PLTR by Dec 4th?
overslept which caused me to not panic sell PLTR 
Look at PLTR man, so inspirational 
A(L)PHA taking me back into da green today
GME saving my whole portfolio. Blood red day and I'm still up almost 20% between two accounts.

Anyone rentering PLTR here, or do we think another leg down?

I'm a bull...loaded in calls. This flat as fuck day makes me think the real dip is tomorrow
Instead of "selling low" I try to think of it as setting my calls free, allowing them to reach their full potential under someone else's care.
PLTR is actually retardedly flat rn

I'm currently up 35% on the day and 100% on the week, all in on GME. I could quit here and walk away and be happy with the gains for the rest of the year. Will I? Absolutely not. Not even going to think about selling until this hits $30/share or higher.
if anyone was still waiting to get in on GME, nows a good time
Buying the dip has never not worked
Fuck I bought GME at $19 today

Never seen such a flat line on the chart with that type of volume as PLTR has. Either algos playing volleyball with shares or big boys loading up. Either way, good consolidation at $27. Expecting another flattish day tomorrow then possible boom town to end the week nice and green.
PLTR gave me 1000 and then took away 500. I feel like shit even though some of yall are in worse case scenarios

GME is up 6% and youre all saying its dead?

How dumb did you have to be to expect the full pop to happen today? Its nit even earnings yet.

People still playing AAPL lurk their married ex gfs on Facebook without a doubt. They might like a photo here and there just to painfully remind them that they still exist. She has to pick the kids up from their fathers house at 2 pm so she never saw your notifications. The father bought PLTR at IPO.
Fuck Im late to the GME Party. Anyway, PLTR to the fucking Moon.
You guys believe were in a simulation?
anyone going to ride PLTR
None of you artists are loyal fucks, stick with PLTR for a lifetime of tendies
PLTR GANG RISE!!!
HOLD PLTR IF YOU HAVE BALLS
When u buy PLTR at 33.50 
Word of advice to new autists:
- it is better to invest in solid companies stocks than options, less risk, less reward, more peace of mind, but wrong sub lol

if you must jump to option trading:
- dont dump your life savings on first trade, avoid weeklies (theta will murder you), and learn the greeks
- buy with the herd, sell before the herd
- dont get too greedy, if you want it all, you will lose it all
- expect blood on your green shirt, that is perfectly normal, the algorithms are too sophisticated and you are not untouchable
- only bet what you can afford to lose
- if you cant be the shark, be the pilot fish, which most of us on here are, or wanna be, and that is completely fine.
- learn as you go
BUY PLTR DON'T SELL It's gonna be $35 in 2 days, this is just a trap for people having weak hands and selling right now.
If youre a  and you sold the dip, clap your hands   

If youre a  and you sold the dip, clap your hands   

If youre a  and you sold the dip, and your portfolio looks like shit, if youre a  and you sold the dip, clap your hands  
THERE IS NO PLTR RUMOR 

ITS JUST UNEMPLOYED GAY BEARS
DIE YOU SHIT STOCK FUCKING NKLA DIE YOU PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT
I don't mind shit talk back and forth. But I don't like people advocating for self harm.


But a special place in my heart of hate is for ppl that comment.

'told you so'

'tried to tell yall'

'I said last/yesterday'


Just shut the fuck up and post your gains from your positions you were so confident in. 99pct of you fucks either had $500 in play or didn't even open a position on your own advice.


Smells like bitch in here with 20/20 hindsight.

I thought drill team 6 was coming not dip team 6
SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP


Bought a PLTR put just so it can go back up. Sacrifice has been made
serious question. does PLTR have potential to grow within the next few years?
fuck, i think i get it now. Just be smart, don't be dumb. Be patient, but also act fast. Time is a flat circle.
 
Buy PLTR now.


Discount prices
SHOW EM ROBINHOODERS DONT GIVE A FUCK AND WE WILL BUY !!!
Pltr green by noon...
The wind is at our back GME gang!

Ill be dead before Im a bear. Incoming super V
Recesion its done
APHA is just ALPHA but incapable of holding an L
Get back in before its too late PLTR
The drop scared me and now I dont know what to do
Those Cyber Monday discounts were straight FIRE
Looks like we found how low the balls are on PLTR.
AAPL giving up half a day's gain in 10 minutes. Thankfully I bought right at the top!
Buying more PLTR call options down over 50% paid off for me. Patience is a virtue boys. Dont be spooked by a 10am dip. 


If you buy ICLN calls, you get a blowjob from AOC
Pltr gap filled.. now we moon
MFs panic sold PLTR, I panic bought.  The tendie machine is printing.
Every time you see red ANYWHERE simply buy as much as you can... In 15 minutes it will be back green and at new all time highs. This market is literally allergic to red days
Damn walk away for 5 fucking minutes to get some coffee and my PLTR puts decided to actually go to the fucking moon and back in that window, lmao
Fakest crash I have ever seen
Holy shit TSLA in free fall - gay bears like 15 minutes ago. Down 1% lol
BUY PLTR Free Money going to have a floor of $30 and will never go under that again in no time.
Really good sign for PLTR seeing this strong a bounce back
PLTR ... he is the one.
PLTR is a horse, just keeps trucking onward
Bought a 12/4 PLTR $45c lotto. Let's goooo AH market
Just touch the green you whore
Okay, CRSR. Now it's time for you to go up.
GME PUMP GET IN NOW
Cyber Monday stock sales still on!
GME $20 EOD, get in now.
The problem Tesla bears can't solve as S&P inclusion nears:

1.	Fund buys $500M in Tesla shares
2.	Fund buys $800M in Tesla shares 
3.	Fund buys $650M in Tesla shares 
4.	Fund buys $1B in Tesla shares 
5.	Fund  buys $2.4B in Tesla shares 

...so on and so forth
Damn I panic sold
Today is the definition of diamond hands
[deleted]
PLTR buying opportunity
This shit isn't done yet.
Lost it all boys
Today is legit fucked
I didnt hear no bell
#WHO THE FUCK USES TASTYWORKS 
APHA and PLTR gang rising
Bought pltr 26c at the bottom 
Now that MMs finished manipulating TSLA and loaded up shares on the cheap. There should be no one left to be fucking selling
The daily chart rn looks like our heart rate today
[deleted]
lil yachty strikes again huh
Dow selling off 450 pts, GME actually holding up remarkably strong in spite all the broad market selling pressure.  Really setting up for a huge rally
Couldnt imagine being good at this shit lol
Popped me a perc, been itching since noon.
If youre too poor to buy GME, buy APHA
no one:

wsb retards: buys gme @ 19
APHA
PLTR just took a lil nap but its back up now
Hope you guys bought the dip on APHA an hour ago. 
   **Morgan Stanley Bullish On Many Banks, But Downgrades Bank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs**
tim

fucking

apple
Looks like GME is holding 17.5 support thats good
Lmao epic fake out bears were loading up on puts
Draftkings almost being green today shows its power
Wtf CRSR just spazzed
holy mother of green dildo CRSR
No one shilling my positions

All my positions printing

Correlated
pltr paper hands got cucked
PLTR making me feel motion sickness. Sold at top, bought at bottom, glad to see recovery, but man, probably gonna barf watching this action.
Just being lame APHA, GO HIGHER
Here comes the bounce - should be green by close :) PLTR $30 easy
I'm sticking with PLTR. Diamond hands win the day. 

Now, looking at 5g. Gotta make some plays in that space.
PLTR PUMP! Beat the bears
hot fucking take: market will rip through december and 2021 will rip harder than 2019

stimulus too op
Once again, I have missed the PLTR dipped. Fk me in the fking ass. FML.
Did Apple announce they were injecting their IPhones with moderna vaccine or something? Wtf is this?
Hope you retards bought the dip
CRSR casually popped up like 8% in an hour lol
Global warming fucking with my snowboard season. Fucking December and resorts arent open still
Every time GME hits $17.50 I buy more shares
TSLA 610 EOD
Only took 2 hours, but APHA finally starting to reach its potential
Still time to hop on the APHA train before we leave the station. Wouldnt be surprised to see it trading above 10 next week. One month chart is crazy bullish and volume is picking up. One of the better balance sheets in the pot stock genre and its undervalued in my opinion. I loaded up big on some December 24 10c as a nice Christmas present to myself (hopefully).
yall should pay attention to CRSR, i think its bottomed and perfect for the recovery
bough a Tesla 600 call
GME and MAXN... woke up
How fucking bipolar is AMD today? from \~+3.5% to dipping into the negative to now at close to +4% lmao
aapl having the best day of its life since august. a 2% is a god damn unicorn now
For everyone who bought at 19+ today on GME....just hold and we'll go back above that soon enough.  Don't FOMO weeklies
GME giving away free PS5s for call owners
Soooo NKLA puts free money? Is there even a bull case?
Boys. Lads. We have over 3 hours for this shit to bigly green. Have faith
I fucked up. I sold gme 20c and thought game stop was at $14 instead of $18
The only reason Im barely green right now is thanks to Apex
I coaxed my friend into trying US stonks... and he starts today of all days rofl. 

He wasnt kidding when he said he tanks everything.
The power of retail combined!! 
RH needs a shuffle button: 

Set your amount. 
Set date. 
Calls or Puts. 

Shuffle. 

They should have never turned me down for [Creative Director. ](https://twitter.com/pepeforthewin/status/1301624858967711745?s=21)
I bought this boomer stock a couple weeks ago its fucking mooning, ticker is AAPL I think
In what freaking direction is this market trying to go?
imagine if no one sold ever
PLTR floppin around like a big gay bear
For those too young or new to appreciate the insanity that is TSLA. When I bought TSLA stock in 2016 it was $220.  Channeled between $180 and $320 for three years which is normal! 10% gains in a year on stock is "good." The stock was at $380 in March 2020 and lower in January. It's now at $3000 or +800%. 

Welcome to the bubble.
Here comes GME
Rotated from PLTR to GME. Thx for the profit!
Broke: focusing on the PLTR rumor

Woke: talking about the BA rumor
today is the red day. mooning tmrw. PLTR IS OK
GME melt up to $20.
Andrew Left has no idea how many angry autists had their futures ruined by a 1-minute tweet
Up $60k > down $40k > flat. 
AMD to the moon  
Where's the AMD gain porn for today? Shit is taking off.
1/15 TSLA 800c
Buy your share of Nikola puts today. Trevor is selling 90 million shares tomorrow or day after.
weed having a positive day is the biggest bear indicator
Guys, stocks are dropping because its a Cyber Monday sale. Buy it all!
We need a new system where original plays get more exposure than the meme ones. Too many posts on PLTR have overshadowed all the other gainers
AMD finally back on the menu after doing nothing for 3-4 months
Whats the shortest time youve been at a job? Tomorrow is 6 months for me and its so terrible Im considering quitting but Im worried how thats gonna be viewed by potential employers.
Whos with me in the sun squad 

If you know you know 



Lets dial our friends and grow together !!!

Merging together into bliss
So has Trevor Milton got a market sell order for his millions of shares for tomorrow?
Fuk why didnt anyone tell me to buy the AMD dip this morning???  Ur all fired as my financial advisor
So many traders get busted by days like this when their stop losses get triggered.

Not us though.  We are too big brained to risk possible gains by getting a stop loss
Are some of you guys actually pumping sundial. Fuck off
b i t c o i n hit 20k
I can't believe it waited all weekend, so see my account slowly bleed out.  
Fuck this shit!
CNBC: *Behind the pullback - What's driving it?.... Extreme Bullishness*
PSTH back to $27 EOD
Thank God Aapl and Amd keeping my portfolio in the green. Nio Pltr and Baba all deep red
Show your face if you bought NKLA at $90??
the dial of suns is killing today

it ain't a penny stock much longer dipshit mods
> 1:00pm est 11/30/2020: TSLA just announced the building of a new gigafactory in Australia. When asked about how this will effect the already notorious volitility of the stock, CEO, Elon Musk stated: Kangarangs and boomaroos for everyone! Fuck your calls and fuck your puts. Im shaking this bitch till all the drop bears fall out the tree.
OK AMD shareholders, let's not profit take like little bitches this time from one good day.
Such thing as trading competitions? Start with the same amount and whoever comes out on top after a day/ week wins
If weed isn't legalized could all these weed stock surges just evaporate? isn't the vote coming up this week or something?
Lol did half of you guys get wiped out during that drill? Its oddly quiet in here
APHA will be over 10 by middle of the week.
it is your duty as a citizen to buy gme shares right now
Lol why does ACB always go up the most out of all the weed stonks? Is it just heavily shorted?

Easily one of the worst weed companies
STOCK ROTATION FROM MEMES INTO VALUE ... wait
PLTR down but the quality of loss porn is up. I guess that's what they call a hedge.
omg imagine the the weed bill passes and we swim in tendies.

$APHA

 

 

 

 
And just like that, all fear has been eliminated. TIME TO BUY AGAIN
When pltr shit this morning it reminded me of all those mink in denmark that they burned to death needlessly.
APHA $10EOW 

  
Anyone think shitrons next target is gme? They seems to go after highly talked about meme stonks
AMD now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time
The lack of rocketship emojis in recent DD titles has shaken my faith and confidence in the conviction of WSB DD
Go CRSR you sexy stonk 
CRSR time to hop on?
holding APHA? got 9 calls
PLTR is kissing the tip right now
Diamond hands on my PLTR 12/4s 12/24s and LEAPs
It is looking more and more possible/probable that a nasty short squeeze will happen on GME.  10% up today, regardless of a drop from premarket is a great sign.  Im not a meme stock guy but Id say hold steady on this one.   And I bought an addl 800 shares today so ive got some skin in the game.
Yes this consolidation has me very bullish on PLTR. I was a little worried boys not gonna lie!
Is it to late for CRSR?
Everyone seems to be condemning PLTR bears but all I see are PLTR bulls. Do the bears exist? Identify yourself!!!!
Look at my boy PLTR fighting off those Andrew Left fucksticks
PXT MOON MISSION
CRSR REVIVAL
Why cant we simply just rig the markets so that they start red and end green every day? That way everybody wins
AAPL!
Wish I bought more ACB friday Im up pretty nice. Too bad Im a bitch
Oh CRSR you little tease.

In on APHA weeklies. MORE act is going to pass the house for sure
Well I learned what IV is this week, thanks PLTR! 

Back to some safe shit to recoup these losses.
Lets go APXXXT
Buy NIO dip?
CRSR rally legggooo
AMD did in a day what AAPL did for a week.
so pltr is just consolidating here to moon tomorrow or is the train ride over?
Are we getting a run up with PLTR in an hour?
as crappy as robinhood is overall, the instant deposit feature is really nice
Legitimately don't understand who is buying NKLA
GME pump
GME done being gay for the day. Gonna end over 18 dollars for sure
LETS GET IT GME
Fly my little  fly!
MOVE TESLA YOU DIRTYY BITCH I LOVE YOU

Tbh I fully expect the WH to start vetoing some of the critical economic bills (government spending, stimulus) just because
Last chance to get into CRSR under 40, its opening 43+ tomorrow with the revised earning estimates.
Ohp! AAPL at $120. I should sell

CRSR calls only up 18% wtf
APHA seems undervalued
Aapl, 119.99  .... aapl 120.01 
Think GM purposefully made the announcement the day before insiders could sell their NKLA as revenge for NKLA misleading them?
Holy shit AAPL actually broke the sell wall
Where can I find this Citrus guy? I wanna punch him square in the nose
hey man, even in the midst of this high volume sell off, atleast THC is making higher highs and higher lows lol
At this point BABA is like a tired old toothless crack addicted whore with cross eyes selling $10 blowjobs in front of the Coney Island housing projects. I mean what the fuck?
Bear's didn't win today, Bulls didn't win today, the invisible hand definitely didn't win today.

Bout to be power hour.  Got the lube and Addy ready.  Lets fucking roll
Had a problem today closing my GME play.

My calls were so in the money that nobody wanted to buy them, 0 ask, I could not even sell them lower than the intrinsic value wtf never trading this garbage again.

I guess exercising was the way to fix it.
Great stonk of the sky, please hear my cry.

Transform thyself from orb of light and bring me tendies in this fight. 

Envelop the market with your glow and cast your rage upon my foe.

Unlock your powers from deep within so that together we may win. 

Appear in this rigged game as I call out your name, 

I summon PLTR!
just bought a Apple call its gonna drop
Tim  back in da house

https://investorplace.com/2020/11/why-bears-must-not-bet-against-pltr-stock/

As always time is on your side and (if you can) consider shares and long dated calls in addition to retardation weeklies
TSLA will cross $600 today.
I knew DIS firing a small countries worth of people would be bullish.

If you put money into GME we would be making money together and that would make us brothers
AAPL IV is so fucking low all calls are printing like a mofo

Sold 30 shares of PLTR to boost my Apex stock. Still profit from 22. Np.

Going to see big gains in both pltr and apex.
Tesla just had some healthy pull back so it can go to 630 eow.
Pretty sure theres a Robinhood glitch. While it feels good i dont think I had a 17% gain today
PSTH power hour

PLTR is painful to hold. That's why you must be theta gang for the time being. I believe it'll be 50+ sometime in the next couple months, and 100+ in two years.
You people are some of the most impatient fuckers ever
Lost a good amount of money just being a retard today.

Today sucked other than my spac babies but I still have confidence in GME and TSLA for tomorrow. Nothing that made GME attractive changed, today just wasn't the pop day we are promised.
Buy the dip you minks
real talk these cyber monday deals are fucking weak. Amazon and Newegg have jack shit
You fucking cucks dumping apple, fuck you
How can 1 ankle cause so much destruction? 
STOP THE COUNT!!
TSLA GOT ME ON THE ROPES LIKE NATE
GME isn't getting squeezed, my portfolio is.
TURN OFF THE MARKET. Turn it off
Up 30% on APHA position opened today. Hoping for another good day tomorrow.
Why is everyone freaking out about TSLA. Down 3% after multiple 10% days.
CRAYONS UP RETARDS

I hope we settled this.. IF PLTR DIPS YOU BUY THE DIP YOU BISCUIT LIPPED TARDS
PAPER HANDS THANKS FOR THE CHEAP PLTR
Went to an hour long meeting, come back and PLTR has dropped down to 24, and rebounded up to 27.  


Missed the Dip.  Again. Fuck
You all complain that we never get a dip, and when we do, you   it
So I bought this headset last night for PC/Xbox. Expensive ass headset with my NIO/PLTR tendies. SteelSeries Arctis Pro+Gamedac. 

I originally wanted another headset that was out of stock. The salesman I asked if any were left then suggested this one. 

I see on the box it says PC/PS4. I ask Hey, it just says PC/PS4 on the box, does this work for Xbox? 

The salesman looks at the box and goes Oh yeah it has all the cables, Im sure it will work fine. 

It does not work fine. 

Fucking bastard.
GME TO THE MOOOOOOON 
PLTR back to open by close fuck you
i don't fucking know how i did it, but im up 32k today.

did everyone forget that PLTR is going to play a huge role in distributing the vaccine? and with 3 potential vaccines coming up, wont that mean PLTR will definitely go back up?

Crazy how PLTR hype died down after like 2 days
Anyone who sold PLTR shares today is a fucking retarded pussy

 Just dropped $1000 on PLTR 32 calls 12/4
It's the day of the rope for low quality submissions. We're sending a message with dozens if not hundreds of temporary bans for low quality submissions. I've been banning since 9AM.
All I want for Christmas is $50 PLTR 
I need PLTR to go fast and hard out of the gate this morning. I'm not patient with this play.
TSLA bby,   these 2022/2023 500c calls no matter what
I have just heard of this new stock, its called APPL, looks like its gonna be big.

SYKE!

PLTR bb  
I think that pullback on PLTR on Friday was a bunch of cows that have done 0 DD on what PLTR actually does.
Bro why do people try and scare others into selling. If you want to sell go for it but spamming the thread with doom and gloom is annoying as fuck.
T H C B making moves
The day has come to see whos going to paper hand PLTR...hold the damn line. Lets fuck Citron

WTF did I buy more PLTR at open!?

NKLA is going down but my puts arent printing!?

If you survived the sell off, you're gucci
PLTR isn't looking so good right now, POST MORE ROCKET EMOJIS
There are a lot of Should I sell ____ posts here. Bitch, as a bull (even if you bought shares), your investing thesis better be stocks always go up, and, secondly, you should have been ready for shit to drop because you dont always get stuff at the best price.

No, dont sell $BABA. How many companies get 72B in sales in ONE DAY?  on a fucking holiday they invented!

No, dont sell PLTR. Unalienable government contracts and innovative data consulting thats likely to be MORE in demand as allies pony up?

No, dont sell MC-fucking-D. Its McDonalds and it would go up if there were a meteor hurtling towards the earth. Some people think theyd be spending their last minutes fucking, but more likely theyd be diving across the counter to buy the greasiest burger they could.

No, dont sell SPCE. It uses literal  to transport autists to space.
PLTR just made me jizz
JFC MAN PLTR PICK A FUCKING DIRECTION
PLTR 43.50 eow 
I can't wait for tomorrow so all these suckers that buy PLTR puts today will get a reality check
BUY GME 
You dont have to be lonely,

I was told GME was squeezing to the moon. How do I get a refund?
Trying to decide if I should sell BABA and buy GME ?
I wish biggie was still alive to share this day of green tendies with us
Why is everything fading
Is arrival stock a pump and dump?
Happy to get back to a full week of the market. Up or down its still more entertaining than the weekends
Tell me what to yolo today 1000$ i want tendies
I wonder if Croissant Gaming will do the thing again.
Just want BABA to go to 290, it was basically all set to gap up this week but a bunch of cunts had to go on about ANT IPO again even no there is no new fucking news.
GME touched $18 in PM

Gonna be rock hard if we have another killer day
Lol Morgan Stanley downgrading GS, JPM and BAC.. how does that even work?

APHA breakout
CRSR provides full 2020 outlook with only positive numbers boys.
Gme gains dropping 
Okay instead of withdrawing it's now GME, PSTH, and MRNA.

And it's all shares. I'm in the wrong sub.

BUT WAIT!

PLTR 12/31 35C x15 TO THE MOON
Name a more iconic duo than SPCE and fading before open.
Wow I wasted money buying puts to hedge I am such a fool FUCK BEARS
Salty bear on the menu once again.


Looks and its still the same price it was back in August who cares
Shit attempt at Vax pump... same vaccine just applying to fda for emergency authorization which is terrible... whos gonna take that
O/U 9.5 GME shorts jumping off their buildings by Friday?
Markets aren't buying that vaccine pump and are cycling back into technology.  


QQQ on the move...
APHA calls today
ICLN so comfy.  +1% per day for the next 5 years
As Covid rages MRNA and PLTR lead the world in Vaccine Distribution.
Just call me Dr. Spac
Green by open. Kinda seems unfair but thank god for calls.
Tesla hittin $600 today 
Got on APHA before you lose out! Been going up for a while now.
Hopping in SPY puts at open because Im ready to get hurt again
When is NIO doing its next delivery update?
Run crsr back to 45 so I can exit these 12/18s
And yolo gme 20c
I hope everyone has learned a very important money making lesson recently: when Shitron says to sell, you buy.  And then buy some more.
DONT STOP TESLA IM ALMOST THERE!
Weed millionaires coming thru 
TSLA 600
GME trending high in pre-market. Hit over $20.
ZOOOOOOM
Everybody make a tiktok convincing the tiktokers to buy gme because im not gonna be the fucking dumbass holding these bags
So now that TSLA is in the SP500, if the bubble pops, does that mean it's taking out the entire market with it?
DKNG official sponsor for Detroit Pistons... lets hit $60 today
I bought APHA and GME calls last week. This gon b gud
I hope no idiot buys GME options with this IV and bidask wider than a sorority ass
Remember when all eyes were on VIX ?

GME, CRSR, QS & PLTR
Imma need you to turn around and gap up MGNI
Love the sound of wood crackling on the fire.

Almost as much as I love the sound of gay bears getting destroyed.
Adding tsla to s&p is going to rank the whole market like the split did.
Good luck today APHA army
DKNG      fire up the Pistons we headed to Mars
Cant forgive myself for not buying GME when It was 6 dollars I was thinking about it at the time
BABA BABA black sheep  you got any wool left?
Why is GME rising?
Call me crazy but donnies gonna take UVXY to the before he leaves
So .. sell TSLA at open?
Everything is Green apart from BABA and WORK.

Guess what? I did hold only those two. Fuck my life
Im gonna try something new and do early morning grocery shopping before the market opens. Lets see how many old people are at Ralphs at 5AM
I feel like we have somehow rotated back into "people find the sub and beg for scraps" phase. Feels like June again.
Oh Lordy, weed stocks just keep climbing higher
Should I buy GME right now in PM?
Meme stocks are the new hedge
CRSR print money today?
So say a retard bought 40$ PLTR calls expiring this Friday and is down 82%. Any hope?
I hope those HFs shorting GME are waking up and feeling like I did in September.
Don't forget about our Chinese friends NIO
GME all in at 9 AM when RH lets us regard in LFG back to $20+ this morning
NKLA +20% back down to 0% in 20 minutes wtf
APHA calls have been and continue to print like no tomorrow.
Draftkings over 10% day incoming
These 650 February testicles are going to make me Rich

I meant Tesla calls
APHA buying opportunity. lets break 9
Had MRNA calls Wednesday. Sold for 50% gains. Probably gonna be a 15+ bagger today.
Honestly though watching that interview with Alex Karp from a few months ago makes me believe in Palantir that much more. Great to see that two people that differ so drastically politically understand our western values are so great and worth protecting and were able to start and run a billion dollar company together.
TSLA needs a second wind to blast us off to 669.69
And now nkla crashes even harder. Is that Trevor "Dipshit" Milton selling in premarket?
ICLN, FCEL and GRWG boom town
Shorts may try some fuckery to snuff us out. Just remember that. The buy button is your friend. The sell button doesn't exist.
If you're buying GME shares this week, at least hold until 12/8 earnings run-up. You're in it now. Don't be PAB and sell if it dips.
GME fomo as kicked into full overdrive, huge move premarket hours
A bunch of beta males just sold their GME 
Nikola d.e.d ... dead
Not enough comments about Tesla tbh
THE BADGER IS DEAD
ICLN all day, dont stop wont stop.
Holy fuck what happened to NKLA?? It was up 11% last I checked what a reversal 
Seriosly fuck my face for selling Tesla and moderna calls on Friday
NKLA leeching off the previous EV hype was stupid anyway, this company doesn't have anything besides a car you have to roll down a hill.
Just got gme shares premarket boys, operation short squeeze commence! To the moon!!!
They working overtime keeping GME under 18
GME better gap up tomorrow
What a stressful trading day... full of ups and downs and mostly disappointments.... hope everyone is alright. Just hang in there brothers!!! 
[deleted]
DO NOT FEAR THE TENDIE

&#x200B;

BUY CALLS
Nikola circuit breakerssss
Trevor cant sell the rest of his NKLA stock until Dec 3rd, lmfao
My ICLN 4/16/21 22 calls looking juicy.
NIKOLA FILES TO OFFER UP TO 53.4M SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

*NIKOLA FILES TO OFFER UP TO 23.9 M SHARES LINKED TO WARRANTS
Palantir devs probably look and act like edward snowden
I, for one, cannot WAIT for the NKLA memes this week  mad at GM for even considering it and making all my puts expire worthless months ago.
Not a nice feeling consistently being on the wrong side of a trade...
So where the bears that said circuit breaker today? 
buy gme at open or wait a few minutes?
when will this fraud of a company NKLA get delisted
I invested in Pfizer and RKT instead of Moderna and Palantir. Ask me how my day is going
This market is *juuust* retarded enough that I would not be surprised to see NKLA go green today
What happened to all the paper handed bulls last night sHoUld I sElL futures dont mean shit
TSLA $615 EOD
Is my ban over yet?

Edit: Nice
Whats the word on the street about A.P.X.T? 

Not seeing anything special about it. 
Cheesy name from early 2000s. 

And the CEOs name is Jeffrey Epstein. 


Cant make that shit up.
What are your guys thoughts on GME? Should i buy more. looks like squeeze is happening i dont want to miss out
Everyone remember that to trigger a SS on GME you need to buy and hold shares, and ~~place ridiculously high limit order sales on them~~ do what you can so they can't be lent out for shorts.
QS 
Imma skip QS... man that one is a missed opportunity last Friday...
These ICLN calls just steady printing.
Poor bears, always getting edged Sunday night just to wake up Monday morning with blue balls
This NKLA put is about to print baby! Can already smell the tendies warmin up
Has anyone considered starting a WSB Meme-Autist Index?  Basically a listing of 3-4 stocks that are trending at any given time on this sub?

So people can stop asking what they should invest in with their paltry RH account?

But for entertainment purposes, mostly.
GMEME
Think Im doubling down on APHA and  this week. Also like NIO and DKNG 
NKLA factory update, spoiler it's still the same barren patch of dirt   

https://youtu.be/cFiqdf2YfUI
BABA wrong way big guy
The only thing I dont like about using a different broker than RH is that now I have to get my ass out of bed and go 12 ft to the computer to trade
Im so nervous WHAT DO I DO WITH MY HANDS?!
Dont get faked out by premarkets, always wait till 10 or later before yoloing or roping
1k to play with today boys. APHA calls? Date and  exp?
I'm thinking what the most absolute retarded thing someone can do today would be to buy NKLA calls and yet wouldn't be at all surprised if they printed somehow.
Should I buy GME/TSLA Calls at open or wait till 10:30 dip?
GME or ACB?
Pre-Market Green...Let's fucking Go!!! 
Hey everyone have a great day
Gme shares or calls ?
wow futures recovered. Might be positive for the day.
Been in APHA since 4.73. Glad to see this hype : D
Okay this is not just Robinhood FOMO because the PSTH warrants are up big too. I think everyone expect an imminent announcement if Spacman has started doing media rounds.
Too late to FOMO GME ? Been selling puts, shares looking juicy
Alright i'm not missing another autism express. Just jacked up my account with the last of my piss-away cash. What ratio do I go for GME/PLTR?
AMZN as flat and emotionless as Bezos face
So ready for 9:30 my entire account in GME calls.
To buy GME or to watch GME
Suck my dick NIO
40c pltr 2/21 
Just a reminder to new GME bulls, this is a manipulated stock by some very angry bears. Expect volatility, but do not sell your shares.
Wow congrats gme call holders
And just like that, $TSLA will never be under $600 again.
PLTR calls or GME calls?
Got into GME for 1500 shares at 17.68. Ready for the squeeze. Or at least the rally up until earnings.
Buy GME at open or wait for dip? Watching it like a hawk
Lets not pretend like we dont already know PLTR gonna come out FIRING as soon as things open lol
Yooooo I just remembered a month ago in a discussion board post for school I shit on NKLA and some dude responded angry and said GM wouldnt partner with a shitty company

It must hurt to be right buddy lmao
Why tf did I think getting BABA calls was a good idea
Omg its tanking

Fuckin calm down retards, itll shoot back quickly
Sold out of PLTR for 38 k profit and switched to ~~CSRS~~ CRSR. Looking like the right move.

APHA is still criminally undervalued. Best  financials of the weed stonks and making big plays in US market with Sweetwater acquisition. To the moon 
I guess the shorts are trying to keep GME below $18? something about cutting losses and the threshold at $18 yadda yadda yadda
GME PRINTING
Alright Im on the shitter, lets get these markets open
Got an unemployment claim from someone laid off over 10 years ago. Definitely not weird
Damn GME already on that moon mission 
They are truly trying to get folks to buy in at these outrageous prices...holy shit
Holy crap. Forgot I bought 1 GME 12/4 18 call EOD Friday. Well, at least I got something in the green.
GME lol amazing
 garlic hands only.
10 minutes ago: "PLT plummeting I panicked and sold everything"

Now: "It's rising again how could this happen?!"
WSB has something to prove today
ICLN broke $24 this morning.
APHA $20 by end of the week
Fuck work bro
Bought 2K more GME shares lets go
I need the shorts to attack GME at open so I can get a better price for more shares
GME is proof WSB runs shit
PIC  also 
ACB calls > Free money
I'm so nervous, I feel like I'm about to enter a fight to the death in the Roman Coliseum lmao

Fuckin markets man
Everyone here bought gamestop right? Shouldn't this go up more to like $22? I mean who is selling gamestop? There's only buying
My new strategy is to just go all fucking in on the meme stocks. Wish me luck
\# MMs losing steam. BUY EVERY DIP
PLTR , I TRUSTED YOU!!
This day is more red than I had hoped. But that's how it goes.

Cuz I bought at Friday open 
[Watching all my positions](https://i.imgur.com/KRaFw2C.jpg)
I dont know how the stock market works, but people were talking about a correction soon, whatever the fuck that means. The only advice Im giving myself is wait for the dust to settle before making a move; it could just be the start of another 3 week bull run anyways
damn we burnin down today
my parents keep asking me what i want for christmas and it's making me wish robinhood gift cards were a thing
Shout out to CASH GANG!
I sold my pltr calls -60% boys get ready for it to moon

out of PLTR with $64k in profit. just waiting for a likely bottom before i jump back in with 1/22 LEAPs and delete my fucking phone.
Well, this sucks. Everything i touch turns to shit. Lost money on PLTR last week, currently losing money on TSLA this week.
You can smell the panic
holy fuck this gme dip must be bought
Some fucking blood bath... not seen a red day in so long. This feels wrong
Jesus Christ...

I converted all my PLTR calls to shares on Wednesday and boy do I feel lucky...

PLTR GANG DEAD

TSLA GANG ON LIFE SUPPORT

XPEV NIO BABA CHINA GANG MORE BROKE THAN BEFORE
Literally everyone saw this coming last week lmaooooo
bruh this is not ideal
This sub is gonna be a ghost town after this week
The guy that commented in that GME DD post talking about everyone being paper handed was right smh sad.
Pretty sure most people who are in PLTR stock wise have an average CB around $16. We OGS are still chilling
Wait. Why is EVERYTHING tanking?
Wow thank fuck I took profits on PLTR this morning
The people telling you to buy this or that right now are not your friends. Be fucking smart and don't FOMO into something.
Going to buy a spy put to stop this madness. Dont worry we will moon in a few minutes after I buy
Following wsb advice is the absolute worst thing you can do for your portfolio unless you're a 30% profit taking day trader
PLTR giveth and PLTR taketh away
Anyone else buying more  here?
Hell yea Ive made 3k today! I mean in the opposite direction of course
palintards in shambles
Lil' Yachty strikes again
Everything is dumping relax people
PS5 scalpers making more money than WSB right now
Accidentally bought puts instead of calls on pltr this morning, being retarded finally pays off
Boomers celebrating right now. They don't know they've won the battle but will lose the war. Corona gonna get your asses for what you did to PLTR
There's only a blood bath because I decided to buy...
This sub needed a good reset like this thank god
Holy duck, I want to buy this dip so bad but it just keeps going down.
When they said Cyber Monday Discounts, I didnt think itd apply to every ticker I own...
I find it impressive that GME bears are tanking the entire market to keep the squeeze from happening
GME will be back right?
It was all a meme

I used to read EV magazines
Fucking fire sale
 winning right now. Buy the dip.
PLTR reverse mooning rn
Just a very red days guys, haven't had one of those in a while. Just take a breath and relax. Market isn't always green (yes yes I know stonks go up). Cut losses if you have to, go cash gang. Think about your next move. Don't panic buy and chase losses that add to your losses.
Remember to post the loss porn boys, my bottle of lotion is ready
So have you guys heard of this PLTR company
Do people still not realize that these big red days are when you buy? Its a huge firesale and yet the bots win because all you dumb fucks sell at a loss.

Smh
BUY THE DIP
Someone on Wallstreet just said "yeah we got em" and shut their 2009 Razr
Guys its been 50 minutes. Panic selling will keep you poor
Idiots looking for "reasons" for this red day, lmao....

It's not rocket science, retards. You can't have perpetual green days. We've had a whole green week, now is time for some correction. This has nothing to do with Biden's foot, COVID, cold weather, etc
Ok Im all loaded on GME, now lets get it to 40 boys!!!
Rough day. But hey, thats show biz baby.
Yall really about to let this citron tard win?
PLTR Bulls: wE aRe tHe maRkEt!!!

30min after open on Monday and theyre loading the shotgun about to swallow a 12 gauge. If this was you this morning, maybe, just maybe, you have too much invested in gambling and should go to a more 95% VOO and 5% gambling allocation...
Bought into PLTR today, down 20% in 2 days Im thinking itll go up this week
Premarket shouldn't exist
Pltr is here to stay clearly because yall have been wanting my baby girl to die for weeks. Maybe we do spam her too much but it is because beauty is in the eye of the thc holder.

CRSR IS BACK.
PLTR getting fucked by Theta gang today
Jumped in CRSR!
My cousin Walter jerked off in public once. True story. He was on a plane to New Mexico when all of the sudden the hydraulics went. The plane started spinning around, going out of control. So he decides it's all over and whips it out and starts beating it right there. So all the other passengers take a cue from him and they start whipping it out and beating like mad. So all the passengers are beating off, plummeting to their certain doom, when all of the sudden, the hydraulics kick back in, and the plane rights itself. It lands safely and everyone puts their pieces or, whatever you know, away and deboard. Nobody mentions the phenomenon to anyone else.
# GME POPPING OFF
You guys are so quick to give up on the chosen one

FOMO'd into PLTR at 32.79 
Upvote if u bought the PLTR dip
Anyone else feel like there are too many potential meme stocks for us to pump now?  The retard is strong but he only has two arms: one for GME, one for PLTR.
It's beyond retarded to put so much faith in GameStop lmao
\-90% on PLTR options

$PLTR WAS THERE FOR YOU! WHY AREN'T YOU THERE FOR HIM?!!
Bought the dip on PLTR

# who panic sold
This sub has devolved into stocktwits level lameness. We need a hard sell off to blow up some of these accounts and weed out the weenies
PLTR is on sale, get in ag 26-27 before it shoots up to 36
Im not very liquid at the moment but I might buy 10 shares of GME via market order for no other reason than fuck the shorts
TSLA TWERK TEAM IN THE MF HOUSE
ALEXA PLAY DONT STOP
Starting to feel the fomo on gme... 
Gme was at 20 dollars a few hours ago, buy the dip at open
"Meme Stock"

a stock that has gained 20% or more in the past week.

This sub is like a modern day ponzi scheme...and once again I find myself at the bottom of the pyramid.

Haha fuck you PLTR and GME holders you deserve it

You know these guys are making $0 on either 
 PLTR TO THE MOON
Look at all of these silly little dickbirds paperhanding PLTR.

Should've bought long dickbirds.
Ok Im officially gonna stop looking at my portfolio or any news/reddit for today. 

Good luck to the rest of you.
I took all the money I was supposed to buy Christmas presents with and bought PLTR I guess Christmas is canceled this year
WSB on every red 5m PLTR candle from here until $20: "Just bought more on this dip. Bears fuk."
All your birches crying about no dips and missing big chances of buying cheap and when a dip appears you panic sell and go cave with your remaining cash. Fuck you paper ass faggets.
STOP THE COUNT!!
Fuck you my calls expire 12/31. I'm holding PLTR.
If you didn't buy the dip, you ain't black!
i only upvote things that align with my huge confirmation bias
Oh hey Im only down 88% instead of 94% on PLTR now
PLTR can only go up boys. Don't let this opportunity slip. 
If you're asking yourself "Is it too late to FOMO into PLTR?" the answer is absolutely not. Nerds are rushing to their RH accounts to buy this dip.
i know some of you retards on here panic sold PLTR and rebought it higher when you saw it going back up
hey just rotate into GME. less market cap than PLTR, so it has more meme power, and its holding up a lot better than PLTR. Just do it, I know you want to
Wow PLTR is cheap great buy opportunity!
Alright, some of you sold at ~$24, show yourselves
TSLA buying pressure, bull flag
PALANTIR MAKING A COMEBACK

Damn PLTR is gonna have this sub chasing that dragon the rest of their lives

WSB STARTING RUMOR THAT THERE IS A PLTR RUMOR - STOCK PRICE WAVERING
PLTR clearly doesnt want to die, and i think were all in it. MM are likely trying to get retailers to sell?

Elongated Muskrat better fucking buy some PLTR stocks
CRSR MOON 
Does anyone else have Nancy Pelosi sex tape in their google searches
Too many of y'all trading on emotions. You need to find a girl who rips your heart out so you can trade sensibly
THICCCC come onnnnnn
Buy PLTR calls they said. Fuck me, I should have known better...
Just shaking off the GME paper hands. No wonder yall lose so much money when you buy at the top and then panic sell on any dip. Hold for a few days at least.
Tim Aapl removed from shit list. Is my boy again
GME getting ready to blast
What a gay ass whore ass day
Looks like GME is getting ready for a take off during the power hour o\_o
The fact that pltr is only down 2% today on a red market day and two trading days after the Citron piece has me hawwwny
green tomorrow. PLTR to 30
Anybody else think to themselves Ive probably got some kind of cancer right now on a regular basis?
I cant believe people are really sleeping on PLTR while its going on sale. Its giving yall a chance to get on board before it gets pumped for real.
I'm about to be in Palantears tmmrw when these calls dont pan out
just did some in-depth TA on PLTR. It looks like it is going to go up or down soon, or maybe trade flat for awhile
GET ON GME BEFORE IT LAUNCHES TOMORROW  

FUCK THE SHORTS FUCK THE BEARS

Gotta love how HYLN hasn't participated in clean energy rally **at all**..
MRNA SAYS FUCK U BEARSSSSSSS IN THE ASS
The timing of these Monday morning vaccine pumps is a god damn joke
I dont know why I bother hedging against downward moves that will never come. The real hedge should just be selling ATM puts on SPY in case they only pump it to flat instead of +1%
Lol these vaccine  pumps are crazy lol every fucking Monday
APHA already going up! 
Tesla prediction 1. Elon overtakes Bezos for a bit then downhill.

Dang missed boat on Jumia.  Jumped 500% this year.  Ok Friend in africa said they are super solid.  Axa and Goldman owns shares.
 Too late to get in now ?
The play for the next 3 days is weedstocks my boys. ACB, Tlry, Apha, Cgc. Pick one, they will all move.
Hopping on the GME train. Shares? Calls months out? Debit spreads? Combination? Lmk
Thank god, I kept my Apha shares through -30% phases
Should I buy GME when the market opens or wait for a couple hours? Will it dip again or just keep rising you think?
CANNABIS
Bought MRNA at $45 per share back in July and sold during pump a month ago at $85. AMA 
APHA anyone?

TSLA is the vaccine to everything!!!
Brian Kemp is such a cuck lol
TSLA $630 eod? Remember, TSLA seems to prefer to move 10% a day, not 9% or less.
Shit man I thought TSLA topped at 500 for some dumb ass reason.

Holy shit Nikola finally got the GM deal?!
Screw this man I'm selling my C IIC and shifting into GME

(side note it's kinda retarded we can circumvent the filter by putting a space in the ticker LMAO. Mods mad)
Everyone said Nikola puts 
Congrats To all my APHA bros
Lmao, what the fuck is with NKLA's premarket action? Did the market maker's cat jump on his keyboard or something?
look at ICLNs 6 month and 1 year chart
One day closer to robotical Roblox
NKLA signs MOU = I made a promise to my best friend for keepsies...

Nkla back to being red. What a shit stock lol
Is FCEL in play this week?  Making up a lot of the gains it lost end of last week, could it have another big run?
QS is gonna fly again today. Backed by Bill gates, jb straubel is on the board who was the number 2 at Tesla. Partnership with VW. And going after next generation batteries to basically monopolize transportation. Dont miss this meme
When I have a bad day, I think of may when you could buy a weekly on any tech company and it was almost guaranteed to become a 10 bagger 

Better dayz
Hahahah fuck Trevor Milton
Guy last night said we were guaranteed to see vaccine news in the morning because of the sell off, lmaoo
A_P_X- T looking juicy pre-market
This vaccine news mightve just saved my calls
I like to stay focused each week on companies Ive studied and not get pulled in multiple directions and FOMO, but damn I really want to place NKLA puts on top of my other moves.
What the fuck is wrong with Alibaba
DKNG leaps are free money.
puts are back on the menu boys. For NKLA that is
What price are you guys (realistic) looking for in thiccb? $20? $30 like CI IC?
NKLA finally burning in hell 
Feels awesome to have a secondary margin account with highest option level access just get cleared off a PDT ban and no current positions.

I made $15 on it trading 0 DTE SPX futures FDs last night so that's already a micropenis head start on the day 
We're literally watching a pyramid scheme unfold
When those short GME limits start hitting 
What a wild ride holding NKLA puts through this morning.. thought I was chilling, then thought I was fucked, now they're mooning
Tesla good for quick scalp at open? What yall boys think
This will-they-wont-they shit with NKLA and GM sending the stock between 15% down and 32% up shows how fragile that piece-of-shit company is.
Buying GME shares as market orders
Been cash gang the last couple days probably will be at least the first hour of the morning as well. Not sure if Im suddenly a bitch but market seems sus
Fuck you Trevor. You piece of shit
Imagine thinking stonks only go up is not the ultimate truth
So when is the MSFT TIkTok deal going through??
Dyslexics rich today off QS calls
The fed really fucked the country up good
Whats to high to buy into GME at open?
What the hell has been wrong with NIO lately???
Sooo...I think NKLA tried to pull a fast one (again) by announcing the GM deal literally the day before the lock-up expires. Too bad the market just took a shit on the revised GM deal terms and now NKLA will dump twice as hard. GG NKLA.
ACB calls are playing out nicely. With weed stonks being voted on those week, seems like people are preemptively buying in to it.
I'm going to need the 1 and the 7 in GME price to swap places
I want a netflix movie about nikola. 
RIP nkla holders
Maybe my last NKLA put...1/15/21 2.5p will print 
Just realized Tesla gets me more excited than any other girl can

A joke of a company selling fucking CD's in 2020 is exploding while a fucking amazon competitor is losing value during the greatest e-commerce time in history. Fucking joke
APHA broke multi-year downtrend last week, likely to go much higher
When something is as obvious as the NKLA play it usually goes the opposite direction.  That bitch will rocket up the second I put my short on.  And either way fuck you Trevmeister

Sometimes a play is so obvious that it doesn't feel right. But it is. This is NKLA right now. The insider selling hasn't even begun yet. This stock is out of fumes, it is steadily rolling downhill if you catch my drift. The GM deal is fucked. Tomorrow begins the true dump. It will be criminal in nature. Please, unless you truly do hate money and everything it stands for, buy a put.

Well try for 600 again tomorrow boys 
You know what really cant go tits up? Become a U.S. congressman and trade free of charge
I don't think you guys realize how precarious PLTR is rn. 

Sure, it's only down 3%, but the amount of selling it requires to overpower the MMs covering all of your calls is pretty immense. The fact it's been flat and red all day is pretty insane.

This is a pretty significant selloff masked by gamma, and you can see it in the order flow.

If the MMs suddenly switch their risk assessment and stop covering calls, it gonna be nasty.

That said, one face-bleeding rally will turn it around almost instantly as MMs scramble to cover.
STOP THE COUNT!
Im going down with the ship on these PLTR FDs
Who's old enough to remember when GME was up 25% pre-market?
Got in at 17 on GME be sure to gobble up all those shares before close... please
Congrats to everyone who did not lose money today. 

Remember the Market is still our bitch as long as we stay SOLVENT 

Premium Sellers live to trade another day.
CRSR holding up well! looks like we heading back uppsies!

Reminder, do not buy short dated calls on GME.  April and shares are the way to go!  Short attacks rough
Is now the time to buy TSLA? 
Apple bruh
You lot are short sighted on GME, no pun intended.

 Its a longer play. Hold the line and strap in mother fuckers.
NIO just robbed me of my 70's
Damn. BABA really having a Cyber Monday sale
Mr. Market leave Tesla alone!
GME days to cover is 5.7. Expecting a short squeeze immediately was never the goal. Every green day is more pressure on shorts.
Get your paper handed act together GME holders

For any gay bears out there reading this morning; I have a bit of information that may make you feel better:

Currency is just a social construct if you really get into it. Money doesnt really exist. Its just paper cotton and ink that we all agree holds value. If youre broke, youre only broke in terms of a social construct. Like everyone else determined that your broke because you dont have enough paper cotton inky things in your pocket. If you have a big dick and love your family, then youre not brokeyoure wealthy. It doesnt matter how much currency you have. That only matters to everyone else who isnt broke and worthless like you are
What will stop AirBnB from buying up all sorts of homes and apartments once they're flush with cash after an IPO and turning them into airbnb places?  Neighborhoods and homes turned into de facto hotels when they were never intended for that. Basically, where the fuck are people gonna live for an affordable price if small time home buyers now need to compete with billion dollar congolmerates paying 100% cash to snatch up properties for short term rentals?  We are fucked for housing.
PLTR, weed and GME. This is the way
What if you

Wanted to go to heaven 

But god said 

You didnt buy GME at 19 
If you have long term PLTR calls, I suggest you close the app and not look at the numbers today, its a good business, very potential long term growth. Stock cant go up everyday, people take profit. It will come back up
Knights of PLTR! We must purge all the weak paper hands. Only the most  shall remain

...wait who am I kidding? PLTR to the fucking moon 
Legit forgot I bought palantir $32 calls when it hit $27 on Friday. Looks like Ill be seeing green for once
This PLTR 1/15 30c has me rock fucking hard rn. Godspeed gentlemen
PLTR 28$ hell yeah 
The dream continues
When should I buy GME shares?
If everyone chooses shares over GME calls. Imagine the damage we will do before New Years . Be smart fellas lets make everyone talk about the GME short squeeze of 2020 jumpstarted by WSB
Seems like PLTR meme has been replaced with GME meme this week
My feeling is pltr has become self aware and is spamming this feed with buys.  Your thoughts?
cool thing about buying GME now is that you might literally get to buy the shares that Michael Burry is dumping
I have been fucked enough this year to know not to FOMO into GME. Thank god I didnt
Tesla

GameStop 

Palantir

You guys are really stumped what to buy?


PLTR is a boomer stock GME where its at
Palantir train dead. LONG LIVE THE GME 
Boys, PLTR noob fucks are preparing $ROPE as we speak  bless this cleansing  
extremely infomercial voice: I made the switch from PLTR to GME and now my tendies are fresh and plentiful
its going to be a long day of staring at PLTR and doing nothing
Love how everyone saying Palantir dead when its green, its just a little sideways trading. I mean I know were a bunch of autist but lets not evolve into complete shitbirds.
PLTR TO THE MOON BOYS 
Still holding my NIO calls
LAST CALL FOR PLTR DIP.... buy it
somewhere in this thread theres a retard who went all in on PLTR at $30
Pltr rotation into GME? Rofl
BUY THIS GME DIP YO
Pltr gang.. I dont feel so good
Its okay guys everything is red except a select few things. PLTR will be fine.
I made $100 today :)
Beyond sick of losing money because of the complete bullshit on this sub. I would be fucking richer listening to r/stocks the past 4 years. Every time I listen to this place I lose enormously.
I sold pltr at the top on Thursday. Feel-good. Sold 300 shares and 20 calls at 32. Feelsgoodman
This sub became a pump and dump scheme the moment mods made DD posts easily available 
PLTR gang in shambles
#TSLA v shape recovery lets gooooo
Sold 350 shares of PLTR at 29.50, just bought 350 at 25. Lets get this ship soaring!
HERE COMES THE PLTR V SHAPED RECOVERY
Wsb is now just a bunch of desperate PLTR bag holders. Dear lord
Lets go PLTR lets goooooo
I only got into trading this week but Ive had a look at the PLTR chart and based on the fact that past performance is always an indicator of future growth Ive deduced that PLTR is definitely going up from here thank me later
Buy the PLTR dip or is the party over?
pltr should announce a 4:1 stock split to moon it to 100
PLTR 27 is a wall, but for how long?  let's burst that
Wanna print money over the next year especially if Biden stays the course as president. 

BP call options 20$ strike Jan 21 2022 
Youre welcome 
GME volume 19M , we're well on the way to triggering that squeeze
GME rocket  loading up for fuel. I hope you cucks bought the dip so you dont cry about it in a few days
PLTR boutta go green

I think this is why people doubt the GME infinity squeeze narrative. Retail's dumping shares at any sign momentum is slowing on a 10% up day. Shorts can evacuate easily. Nothing like the VW situation. It does seem like we could keep melting up to earnings though, for anyone that's not scared of little dips when the broader market is red
MMs want PLTR to drop so they can scoop it up
PLTR stonks is 100000x better then Bald Bezos stock
 to 15  to 15
Imagine if citron never happened. How high would pltr be?
TSLA price too low imo
PLTR has insane volume
My PLTR is January 15th,I'm fine lol. Yall must have short positions
Gay bears attacking GME!

This will just make the squeeze bigger! 
PLTR fueling up the 
PLTR wants to be green so fucking bad. If it hits 28 within the hour bears are mega fucked.
Pltr part of the 27 club now
CRSR is the new PLTR LETS FUCKING GO
CRSR 
Prediction: AAPL 125+ by Christmas.
PLTR volume so high and movement so sideways 
red flat day is a green day tmr
Its like as soon as I cum I come to my senses PLTR 12/4 50c
If you hold th-cb then enjoy the profits 
Taking GME private at $420, funding secured
APHA?
Everyone get it on APHA we going to the moon
How does AAPL 125c 12/4 sound?
Apple has no chill 130 by eow
These GME option prices are absurd. 12/11 30c running 0.9? Damn near 50% OTM expiring end of next week. IV \~282%? I'm tarted, but this is xtra-tarted
Whos buying $PLTR $30 calls 12/4 before the 3 PM power hour?
The market has become predictable as fuck.  Look at this morning - started to look ugly and the data wasn't good, especially housing.  Selling picks up around 10:30 and things look real shaky.  Right after a leg down, like a miracle, Politico drops a "stimulus talks going well" article.   To really end the selling, the Fed has Barkin roll in some dovish bullshit about how much help the Fed can still provide.  Volatility gets killed, price discovery is stopped, mission accomplished.  The formula is simple - wait for a dump and then grab short dated calls and wait for the Fed to jump in.
PLTR flatter than your gfs boyfriends wifes chest
If I had a drink for every successful trade I've made this year I'd have liver failure. Want to know my secret? I'M NOT A FUCKING BEAR.
Palantir baby please gap up big tomorrow
# NKLA float triples tomorrow from 83.5 million to 249.5 million 
PLTR had to give a day to theta gang. We back tomorrow
TAKE OFF THICK BOY, TAKE OFF
I FUCKEN NEED PLTR TO HOLD 27 for the love of the earth and big butts !!!

Man watching pltr gets my adrenaline up way more than Tyson vs Roy Jones
PLTR dead lol was fun - made 10's of thousands, then lost thousands at the end.
My down-voted comment/DD on PLTR/Nio was timed perfectly

The best DD you'll ever find. If WSB is talking about a stock nonstop for 2 weeks, buy puts on the 3rd week.
Regarding GME, hold.. squeeze is coming this week.
Thats alright GME, you can jump up tomorrow
Ev SPACs
Shitron gonna get punked, yet again! 
PLTR 12/31 and MRNA for day trade option gains since that POS can dump anytime. But I think itll keep running til the FDA meeting

Feeling good about my GRWG calls.
Rmg up 14% and markets not even open. My 25 calls on them going to print
NVAX tanking lol

Tesla BABY

I'd like to thank you reatrds for pumping my GME $10 position even more
Come on PLTR give me a nice big green dildo. Pls, I beg. 
Loaded on SPAC hype and Square calls. And idk why, but I was feeling ish and bought 10x 1DTE 362p on Friday. Regretted it all weekend, yet somehow everything is printing. Gonna sell at open and add fuel to the GME fire. Fuck the shorts, we are legion.

Who believes spy could hit 400 by the end of the year ?
Step 1. Make smart play   

Step 2. Take profits   

Step 3. Lose it all on Spy

Step 4. Repeat
LOL @ NKLA
GME mooning again!
GME may be f'ed. I just bought at 17.86. It went to 18.20 then came back down. Don't blame it on me. Blame the fomo in me
How long should I be holding PLTR 1/15 $40C? Until end of the week at least? I always get fucked by time decay and holding my calls longer than I should.
Is GME gonna hit 30 today??
GME shadow lords who are holdin FD's be lickin their lips at this play atm. Feelin kinda slutty being used.
Last time I made money this fast I started losing it even faster the next week. I need to reduce my exposure and focus on more incremental gains for a bit, but that ain't gonna happen
Why is RH still showing active premarket trading as afternoon Friday? They can't get half days right either? No concept of time with them.
Nkla plunge is finally here
GM will not take a stake in NIKOLA, expect a crash to happen

Whats the play on GME? 12/4 calls?
mfw i sold NKLA at 40 in sep and made profit LMAO
lol GM is killing Milton in their announcement before he can cash in.
NKLA 23puts bought last Wednesday were a good choice it looks like.
I said this last night but why post fake stock prices here? we all have to see the price before we sell, its not the 80s where you call your broker from your car phone because of some shit you heard on the radio and he sells at whatever price he feels like
Buy GME at open or wait and see what happens?
No play on NKLA for me but Im glad they fucking died
HTML5 supercomputer
I just got an email from tmilt that they are going to refund my badger deposit, should I use that money to buy NKLA calls?
If you liked NKLA at $30 you should love it at $23!! buy the dip!!

NKLA F
It's a shame I had to lose 25k just to learn not to play weeklies or buy puts :/

Long HD.
Beta bears gonna get CUCKED
I'm really hoping PLTR pulls something off today! Not too confident this morning, hopefully things change! APHA is the one I did not expect to be going up so much lately. Get in on APHA and watch it go up!

Imagine listening to Fauci talk about how he was hyped for the Moderna vaccine for months and not going in
Why is LI getting shotgunned in the face these past few days?
What's the floor on CRSR?
I put 10 times less money on options plays but they make 100 times more than when I buy shares.

Fuck shares. All my homies hate shares.

CRSR is cucking me hard and I'm really lost on if I should hold for EOW or sell now and cut losses.
Amd $95c 1/15 lookin gooood
hello AMD
Oof CRSR got knocked the fuck out
Dam glad I sold outta AMZN for only a $50 loss. Call down over $400 now. 

Elon is my new best friend.
RIP my account
Cash gang til something gives

Classic Tim . Defying market sentiment
lol congress kills the market with a law that basically says they can make up a reason to kick you out the market entirely with vague audits

going well beyond what even the SEC recommends

Investors see the writing on the wall, and they want none of this new trade war shit. Don't threaten their fucking positions bro or you gonna have a bad time.
Cry in AMAZON
TSLA wont be at this level much longer
BABA sell pressure is coming off. We could be headed upwards now. If you want in on a dip now is your time but prepare for a bumpy ride this won't be the last nonsense hit piece.
I love AMD stonk so fucking much. Team Red for life
 is easy when your broker just won't open on the red day
CRSR doin its thing. Will it be a -10% or -20% day?
Rotate from PLTR to GME or AP-XT
nasdaq : red

spy : red

Does anyone feel like their mind becomes more sharp and competent in the immediate moments after gains? 

Its like a mini internal caffeine boost
Weve broken out of the rectangle! https://i.imgur.com/boCZuam.jpg
TSLA 600c 12/4 

Get on the train boys
Turns out diversifying my PLTR weeklies with LEAPS, shares, and cash secured puts couldnt save me from this dip. 

I will never financially recover from this 
[deleted]
Buying on significant dips/weakness has worked literally 0 times for me in the past 2 months. I'm done even trying.

If a stock guess down 10 or more percent in a single trading session despite its outlook, just divert your attention to whatever memed retard stock is trending.
All GME needs is one BIG boy to lush em last the $20 mark
Put 5 shekels into pltr see yall in first class lmao
This is BUYden's mkt now. We can buy our war out of fear. HOLD. THE. LINE.

Why stress? PLTR is minimum $125 this time next year lmao. Fuck you Citron, we know youre a bag holder
Im confused whats happening with PLTR, like it touched 30 then crashed back down? Why?
I dont want to cut my losses with TSLA 
It seems the trend for monday is start off seemingly euphoric, load up on calls and proceed to get fucked.
Im not going to look at my phone today... see you soon

Aaand it's red again...

Putting the Dow 30k hat back in the closet
taking my empty plastic case of options to the cashier at GME and watching a neckbeard with a 2 inch ponytail unlock a cabinet to get my tendies
TSLA is like if Jafar had decided to stick with being a genie. Grants wishes then immediately tanks the holder.
Lmao paper hands sell on red days and then cry later when shit moons later in the week.  can suck my pp my PLTR calls are a month out
Alexa play Free falling

Not having a position on a red day makes me so happy... but so sad too... also TSLA 
This is the best fucking cyber monday deals
Time to hope and pray that that was the bottom of Tesla. Back to 600 now?
Tesla why u do that to me bb
Gamestop holding strong.
Bulls this is honestly the day we needed
NKLA rolling downhill faster than an empty chassis, if you don't have puts you're doing this wrong

NKLA 20P 12/31

forgive me pltr gang, for i had to take my profits. shit got too spooky for me
My whole portfolio is red I love these days

Its strange that the important information I was trying to get out is just as relevant now.

Gunna risk my account but I think I have a way to get out the msg without being banned again.

BUY THE PLTR DIP, FRAGET

PLTR price too low imo
I have to check fantasy football standings to keep myself from feeling like a failure today. Lost $10k so far but I can win $100 if Miles Sanders goes off.
Well at least the rest of the market is ungracefully tumbling down the cliff too, so we're all suffering together.
Remember guys, It's cyber Monday. These are just all reduced prices for today only. Time to stock up on more!
Hmmmm $3.5k swing in the last hour not ideal
BEARS CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT

Teslas implied virginity is finally back
Didn't even consider selling PLTR
Look at PLTR bounce off those lows!  Hop on the rocket!
Whoever stopped believing PLTR will be castrated to pay for ur idiot sins.... the line starts now

When in doubt, dont pull out.

Well I am out till afterhours cause this market is taking a big breather
TSLA bears in brambles (cause they hunting for berries like bears be doing)
Man this Cyber Monday dip was awesome 
So, wait, you guys buy calls a few weeks out and then cash them out at the bottom in the first 2hrs of trading giving you no chance to bounce back up? Like, yeah, it could go down even more, but if you're already covered blood what's one more cut?
Hope yall bought that APHA dip
**congrats fellow TSLA dip buyers, tendies secured**
RIP to all the BABA boys
PLTR pissboys, Buy my puts.
I was promised a rocket ship ride to the moon...
Buying more PLTR at 27. Probably won't see it in the 20s anymore if the overall market is green this week
I hope those that sold at the bottom realize how fast you can actually lose money here.
Bruh PLTR never does shit unless its market open or eod. If you wanna be a pussy just buy/sell eod or at open xD

Slack was around 14B before the CRM announcement. Think we'll see a 30B valuation(around 2x) buy for Slack which is around $50. 12/4/20 45C could be a likely 5 bagger with the announcement tomorrow amc.
High volume sell off, low volume rally. Trade accordingly.

Before any of you purchase $ROPE remember that the entire market had a bad day. Itll probably go up tomorrow or at least some point this week. If you had anything expiring today, well... GG
Bought the TSLA dip at 565. Got ACB and APHA cheap. Good day for me boyz
This NKLA drop tomorrow is going to be biblical
Need a 20% Day for CRSR tomorrow
Am I the only one green today?
Serious question and I dont mean to start an argument. Can someone explain to me how you justify TSLA's current market cap? How is Tesla almost as valuable and Berkshire Hathaway and Goldman Sachs combined? How are they more than 10x more valuable than Honda? How are their future expectations worthy of an 1100 p/e ratio while other "speculative" stocks "only" have a 100-200x p/e ratio?
Betting on ccl, apha, and sq leaps to end the day. GL all
TSLA has gone down 2.5% since I bought my calls and yet my calls are only down 2.3% 
moment of silence for those that bought aapl at the top 
Pussies selling Tesla

GUH
Shoulda known to not get too excited for AAPL

CMON AY PEE X TEE YOUVE GOT THREE MINS TO SHOW THE WORLD YOUR POWER

Be careful if you got weeklies tho
You know tesla gonna have a big day tomorrow after that close
You guys, PLTR is actually doing VERY VERY good for today, the dip-buying was impressive and it shows even Andrew Left with all the market manipulation via Citron cant keep this one down.

When Citron came out with a hit against SHOP, TSLA .. etc in their respective times, they took the elevator down with frightening speed, PLTR right here is chilling in comparison.
[deleted]
Can't believe I sold my tsla 600c 10 days ago
PLTR playing games rn
you guys are so annoying, just hold pltr. theres literally 1.6 million autistic fucking degenerates able to pump shit, but apparently now yall are paper handed autistic fucking degenerates. 

edit: fuck you pussies
Stop being pissed at WSB just because you were too stupid to think the PLTR pump would last forever. The smart ones ride the hype for a day or two and get out
So everybody dumped PTLR after sucking its cock talking about lets show citron? Jokesters
Jesus Christ chill the fuck down. PLTR 40 EOW.
Have fun eating ice with water as cereal for the next month PLTR gang
who else is having a great time watching the PLTR chart today?
You cant expect every day to be green. If youre in the market and cant handle a red day youre a weak stick. Yes it sucks. Were down. Oh well. Sit on your fucking hands and man up. I know some of you in here bought at the top and sold for a loss. Just stay in there. Hang the fuck in there.

Captain Palant, hes a hero. Going to take all your puts down to zero.
Half this sub gonna get wiped out today
So GME squeeze people are expecting noone to sell shares on the way to $500? The amount of shares outstanding would make this nearly impossible. 

But I guess never doubt anything in this market?
GME dropping giving opportunity for wsb army to buy 
Buy GME DIP
So, how are you guys enjoying your (((Great Reset))) so far?
You guys make it so hard on yourselves. Just follow ARKs moves. Cathie Wood is Queen Autist right now. 
If you cant handle 25-100% swings then GME isnt for you. Dont use stops only use limit orders to spoof buys. This is war!

Im ready to get rich off Apex. Im going to follow my plan and 3x my tendies.
Whyyyyy the FUCK does citron get to call PLTR a casino AND ITS THE TOP NEWS for the entire company. A FLAT OUT LIE is considered breaking news?? How much do they have to pay news outlets for this to happen?
ICLN making me NUT
GAMESTOP WENT TO FUCKING $20 PM??? Jfc I bought thousands worth of $20 calls and they expired on the 20th of November.
Those cucks at r/Nikolacorporation are lucky they banned me. Youd have to be a special flavor of autistic to buy into that cousin fuckers company and ban people from a sub "open for discussion" when theyre all shilling Theranos on wheels(rolling down a fucking hill)***
What PLTR options is everyone holding? No more FOMO, I'm buying in
I hope Robinhood never changes the shade of green they use and the way the numbers scroll up and down when the price changes. The day they change those features, the day I stop trading
GME Blasting off
Of course PLTR would be unseated eventually as the King Meme, but by boomer GME of all stocks? Thats just cruel

What we know this morning on GME price discovery, $20.00 pre market did not trigger the squeeze.   The number is somewhere above that.   Keep going.

TSLA get your fat ass back over 600!

If we all agreed as a society to buy one stock and never sell it, we would all be so rich. Ugh
That PLTR is at a bargain right now, it'll never go back down under 30$ ever again once we reach December, buy buy buy!
Stop buying JMIA.

Yes it is the "amazon of Africa", but I think mango would have something to say about that.

When your portfolio of meme stocks is being carried by a handful of penny stock options you bought at random it's time to take a step back and ask yourself what you're doing and why.

Just went $60K long in apple on 4x margin 
These random PLTR drills are fucking annoying.
My mom bought ENPH shares last year at like $25 bc I told her too despite me not having any money in the company. And she did. And she doubled her money in 6 months and sold them. And I just told her what the price is and she was fucking pissed. She desdass sounded like someone from here

The only reason PLTR is going red is because its a red day and Citron. You think anyone gives a fuck what Left says when PLTR tech is running the vaccination operation.  Hold people jeez.
PLTR IV is a ripoff if its going to trade flat. You're crazy if you buy puts or calls at these prices after its lost its meme power
I don't live in California, but if I did, I would leave
PLTR +5% tomorrow
I want PLTR to MOON not just for my calls, but for the s to shut up cus NOTHING is more irritating than a .

Latest rumor: FedEx and UPS are working on a merger to increase total package damages. New company name will be F'dUp. New ticker will be $FDUP
Weed  looking hella juicy today imo
Might sell my 20 GME 12/4 $20c and convert the profits to shares on a dip
Why banned for mentioning Ape x technologies? Ticker hasn't been banned all week. Legit company. Was just asking if any updates on the merger but looks like won't be until Q1
So is the new play: 
Buy GME, PLTR 
Short BABA, NKLA

Are we becoming a long/short hedgefund boys?
Damn everyone blueballed by GME. Every single post was about that overnight and now its quiet
"Honey?  Why do we have so many trash bags piling up?"

RIP PLTR weekly call holders.
That 10% reversal on PLTR in the past 30 mins is fucking hilarious.
PLTR gang - we should coordinate our shifts behind the Wendys dumpster to give out handies. If we pool our earnings from that together we can prob get a 5 for $5 
Buying more PLTR on the dip
BUY GME SHARES. VOLUME IS LOW. WE CAN TAKE THIS SQUEEZE TO THE MOON
I am out of day trades so I am force to diamond hand PLTR hope it pays off
Anyone who has long calls on PLTR do not sell. It is a great company long term. Anyone selling shares is also dumb af. People who own FDs it may be time to exit
Went from +5% to -3% in 1 hour - very cool, very legal
Support on PLTR must have been weak as fuck if Shitron actually dumped it
Fuck this I'm going to bed. If PLTR isn't 30 by tomorrow, I'm calling GLOCK.
Suddenly COVID matters
BUY THE DIP

God whoever showed that volkswagen squeeze chart needs to be banned. now we have tons of gme retards in the daily thinking its going to be exactly like that and thats the only type of short squeeze there is
APHA
  PLTRCRSR buy the dip dummies
ACB and APHA calls
GME is just consolidating for power hour. This should end up over $18 then rip a little into AH. All these dips are just shaking out weak hands or hitting stop losses. Patience and youll be rewarded.
Pltr us now ruining me
Today stinks of funds selling their massive november profits in the morning then retail fomo'ing in to "buy the dip" yet again.

Expect the big boys to keep unloading their bags like this until retail panics and "the dip dips again"
PLTR time for GME
PLTR is the new Overlord.

Pltr hulk candle lol
I bought 100 shares of Corsair instead of calls and will make $100 instead of $10000
My cousin is mad because he bought PLTR @25 and while he's still up he's not a millionaire so he's gonna cash out his profit and put it in NIO

Meanwhile I'm still holding 1000 shares I bought on September 30th and I ain't selling unless it dips to 14
I drew some fucking lines on a piece of paper and they ALL point to one thing

&#x200B;

AAPL $135 EOW
I don't understand this attitude where people wanna bash stuff they aren't even invested in one way or another. Like I don't have any GME positions, so why would I feel the need to tear down the stock? If people are invested and make money then good for them.
Damn PLTR cucking more than me with my ex wife
Get APHA while it's still below $9. Huge week for weed stonks!
Hopefully no one was still holding Kandi calls. Hindenburg torpedoed it this morning.

If you actually think AAPL will hold this boy have I got some news for you lol

FUCK CENSORSHIP

Tell me why Ive been waiting since Tuesday for my funds to transfer to Robinhood. Theyve been out of my bank account since Friday. I could have bought so many shares of Tesla and been positioned to ride the rocket today perfectly. Im gonna sue.

If gme stays down in 17s Im going in 12/4 20c at open

Right on schedule,  there's the 7 am Monday morning vaccine news pump
RMG and Apex popping off
Every put Ive ever bought has expired worthless. I bought 12/11 NKLA puts at 23 and 21.5 last week and they might be the first to print. I will never be a , but I might dip my toes on fraud companys like NKLA
Dont give my 366 0DTE hope

I'm queued for gme calls 12/04 at 17.50, placed it back on Friday. I'm guessing that's not going to go through when the market opens since it's already above that price, right?

Gonna do some real boomer shit and work in my Roth. Sell off my VTI and rebuy back on a dip. Haven't even maxed it out because I've been doing dumb shit in Robinhood. So excited!!!
is it still a good idea to enter TSLA? Feels like its gone up too high
Holy shit NKLA was up over 20% then it dropped to 4%?
Damn man, I tried buying 500 gme shares ah Friday and only got filled on 200. Still feels good but feels bad too
Can crsr get back up to 42 again.. pretty please
My GME 15.5c are looking good
Hydrogen stocks?
Are we green or red
Was so close to buying puts on NKLA last week, phewww

edit: this didn't age well... fuck shoulda bought them!
NKLA just did a straight 180
Should I buy PLTR c35 exp 12/4 or 12/11? First time buying calls.
Nkla +10% wtf?
I really want to buy GME weeklies at open but Im just going to hold my January calls
How is this NKLA news not just a little bit of a coincidence coming today?

Isn't this the same day all those shares can be sold?
Why the fuck is SPY and PLTR not sky high rn?
Getting puts on macys (M). Retracement will be insane
Lol NKLA headfake
NKLA just went from 27 to 32 back to 27 in about 10 minutes. Who is buy this fraud still?
Can we get some MGNI pumps in here please. Send this shit straight to Andromeda
If NKLA can't hold gains with a GM alliance, how the fuck can BLKN hold gains?  


IT CAN'T !!!!!!!!!!

Px target.... $8.00    pre-meme spike.
Get on macy puts early. Black friday sales were abysmal and volume is drying.
I have 200 shares of Moderna, whats the target price to dump it? Im thinking $160, bought it at $125, currently $142
Ugh I have 4/21 $20 GME covered calls. I need to roll or get out. Any advice? Trying to protect my shares. Thinking about just paying to roll up to 30 same date.
These ACB weeklies are about to 5x today
Lmfao NKLA

Fellow retards, is RH gold worth it?
NKLA gonna drop hard, just hoping I get in on some puts before it does.
Look at those two bears trying to short GME during premarket. Lol. I think open might just be the lowest it goes all day.
Surprised that nkla isnt down more.
The bee is good. HC air conditioning is also good
Anyone know a dev who works or actually wants to work at palantir
Whats the deal with Nikola ? What happened ?
Whos puts are printing
Alright, NKLA is dead!
I'm suspecting that the guy saying Melvin has to pull out at 18 is right and shorts are doing everything they can to keep this under 18 because once the big boy is out they know they're fucked
All
All my homies hate WORK.
We made too much money in AAPL in August, theyre punishing us now by holding it steady and gonna make it moon after hours so we cant profit off it
Currently for GME, $17.60 and $18.00 are the two major sell blocks that need to be broken down, with $17.96, $18.15 and $19.00 as minor blocks.
Thank u hodenburg research!! I bought so many puts 
Imagine thinking GM was actually going to purchase a stake in NKLA lol
If you work for a boomer company, get out now while you still have a job to put on your resume
My NKLA put is smiling.

Bought only 1 expiring pretty far out just to have exposure and up like 40% at close on friday. We shall see what things look like at open

when will tesla do the next split?
Vaccine News Monday + Cyber Monday?  Oh baby...calls at open
Pity that most of the nikola bears are deceased after checking the premarket early on and seeing them up like 24%. They'll be looking down upon their gains from bear heaven.
RIOT calls seem like a solid play. Magic coin will break ATH this week

Sector rotation from watching rh to doing my job, boring ass day
Anybody else feeling the market turning?
Did GME 12/4 $25 really open at $.23 or is that a glitch? If not then calls at open were easy money.
Holy fuck massive sell volume on that PLTR red bar
APHA $9 C
 Let the bodies hit the floor 
Yes I bought more weeklies during the Tesla dip
Your kids will be watching The Big Short Squeeze 25 years from now and you wont want to have to let them know you sat on the sidelines

So CRSR raises its outlook but the stock tanks, that makes sense:

https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook
What the fuck is this
How long you guys planning to hold GME for?
uhh should I have sold GME at the top or are we expecting it to go up through the week? Shit...
Just waiting for this Tesla dip to start turning around to load up going into inclusion. Who else is doing the same. I dont trust sustainability on gme so Im not touching that.
IBKR app down?
NIO is gay
Wtf is QS doin
Obvious bear trap is obvious. Tesla s&p inclusion is tomorrow
Rotation into aapl
BABA currently has me bent over and drilling real rough! Send H.E.L.P

Nio where you going bro
Ran out of money buying gme would not fill me at 18.05
Ive been holding AAPL calls for so long. Was down almost $20k on March 2021 calls. 

Is my patience being rewarded?
APHA  ship has no sign of stopping
Where is the guy that was saying yday that whoever doesnt hold BABA calls is stupid cause Ant IPO will be re-announced any day now?
Someone pump RKT I dont want to hit my stop loss
Who thought that the jump between Friday and today was big enough to start profit taking on Tesla? Seriously wtf?
Buy the EV and SPAC dip?
THICC  what is going on
SCRUFFY BELIEVES IN THIS COMPANY! Throwing the rest of my McDonalds paycheck and wifes boyfriends allowance into APHA shares. All or nothing
Oh no bb what is you doin?

Just a little morning correction lads, fear not
Pull out on CRSR or hold for recovery?
Gme baby give me some newly print money

Had to sell NIO and CRSR. Been a great run this past month but there's better options elsewhere
Crsr dying. I was literaly 5 seconds from selling Puts but didnt click confirm 
Pack it in folks, seems pretty gay out there today.

Dude CRSR is dumping so hard wtf
Just die Nikola. It was a nice run. See you in the penny stocks.
They really dont want GME to break $20
Finally!!! NIKOLA Begins its death spiral!
What is up with CRSR?
We edged at 30, had to take a pause and now we are ready to go again      
Down 11% in the last hour. Hold yer bags, laddie! Greener pastures on the horizon!
WSB POWER 
Why is GME up so much, short squeeze?
Just some profit taking by nonretards. We'll be back
Calls are always free money. You can always average down and itll bounce back.
Where were you when CRSR died?

well the thirst time he died it was thanksgiving, i was eating dinner with my family, the second time however...
thank you  AAPL
I bought Tesla $610 call for 4/12 and Im down .
Market sucks today
these 1k+ figure daily changes in my port just looks like numbers at this point lol. could care less honestly.
A) holy shit GME is actually going to do it, after watching you fucks shill PLTR I didnt want to miss another meme
B) VIX rising and my SPXS calls are going to absolutely print in the next month or two
This is so blatantly Monday morning profit taking. Buy these juicy dips fam
WHO WANTS TENDIES? $40 EOW $PLTR
Li auto should have sold long ago :(
Is there any merit to waiting till 7:30PST/10:30EST to let the dust settle before making any decisions?
I used to just lurk on this sub and buy VTI, but now Im full on retarded
Buy GE on this dip, next stop $11
Tsla is one of those sexy bitches that always give you a heart attack

Fuckkkkkk CRSR
Well, just rebought into Tesla for a 600 and 610c dating 2 weeks from now. Time to sit and wait. Hoping that was todays bottom with it having a double leg up.
What reason is there for anyone to sell?
CRSR ring the fucking bell. Whats the stage after bankruptcy, because thats where youre taking me 
AAPL AMD
well my PLTR calls are looking fuk right now but GME giving me life
If SQ dumps at open buy that dip every time. Done this shit like 4 times in the past two weeks

Robinhood actively just taking money out of my account now wtf is going on? Anyone had this happen? Stocks are barely dipping, options are breaking even, but it says Im down 5% and dropping? Do I hold a PLTR option thats not showing or something?
Hyln wtf have you not plummeted down enough already???
Are these EV stocks ever going back up!?
Gme really about to overtake my pltr calls
Casually waiting for PSTH to shoot to the moon...
Why does RKT only go down
Loading up on ICLN calls here
Im so confused. Theres a color Ive never seen before and my line is headed in a strange direction.
thank god i have PLTR shares and have doubled up already otherwise this should would be driving me nuts
Tucson Holdings ain't no bitch
When your account climbs to -50% all-time  feelsgoodman
  
Tesla feels very shakey today
Honest question to my fellow tards - do any of you crayon eaters actually make money on TSLA overall? Like, sure, we all get our dicks a little wet from time to time, but I feel long term this bitch is always taking our tendies.
Got caught with my pants down on 30C PLTR FD
TSLA what you doing bby? This is not the way
Gonna be adding to my wishlist today. 

First of all, wish I didn't fomo into CRSR friday dip
Tf happened? Woke up to my stocks 
Lmao, im not in GME but wow, that bitch has taken off
Wtf is crm doing, looks like a good entry for earnings tomorrow?
PSTH and NLS carrying me
Dump meme stocks and move to the king. TSLA all in
The NKLA reckoning be here. Fraud ass company I hope it goes to zero
TSLA just cup checking us  apparently 

I hope...
Every app and broker and stock quote site is slow as fuck. Volume must be nuts
I think there should be some sort of award for when you use options to climb back to where your stable investing account was, the day you STARTED options, you know? Like some sort of dunce stamp that can be applied directly to the forehead.

Anyway PTON 120c 12/11
I made $33 and I'm okay with that today
Do I just cut my 12/18 crsr calls, already -60% in 3 trading days lol.
Everything I own is down today. Nice.
Whats a good website that updates live stock price quickly? I dont want to be checking my robinhood app every 5 seconds but also dont want to login to my account on work computer.
I need to buy the NVAX DD guy a beer.
MGNI is cleared for liftoff 
Haha yeah! Lets all buy into a company that hasnt seen this price action since 2017. I love how this company does so well in todays world with the pandemic and definitely WASNT  ABOUT TO GO BANKRUPT IN JUNE
Fucking weak ass market
Not having too much fun today
So whats up with crsr?
Nkla dip, what a buying opportunity
Yep time for puts

WSB WHALES WE ARE CALLING ON YOU TO BUY GME AND TRIGGER SHORT SQUEEZE
Bagholding everything at this point.
180 fakie
Well, that deescalated quickly.
BABA and JD are a buy the dip, I believe. you're essentially gambling against the China fear/risk, which I think is overrated
   FROG TIME! Let's hop our way to tendies.
Timber on pltr
Does Michael burry have a fund I can give money to
DIAMOND HANDS BOYS

Tsla slapping me around
GM does not want equity in the pile of shit that is WeNKLA

I'm heavy on cash right now...Market is high as all fuck, and I wanna see how much lower it'll go before I buy again.
MGNI to 20 and beyond!  Because I need it.  My JMIA ass just got pounded.  And will they please leave BABA alone!  God damn it.  Getting FUCKED for the third time in a month on the stock.  And someone please give CRSR some life support.

AMD pushing $90 on a day that SPY is flat/drifting downwards and most of FAANG not having a good day

IDK I am having a really fucking hard time selling my $90c DEC 18
Bye Nkla lmao.
If there is one thing I can count on every single day - RKT being the absolute biggest shitstain in my portfolio. Its not even about the %, its guaranteed red or a giant red dildo for no reason. Absolutely spectacular form.
TSLA is our last hope for today, everybody in this bitch buy OTM weeklies
[deleted]
sorry guys i bot gme puts
WSB reminds me of Oceans 13 when Frank (Bernie Mac) tries to sell that retarded dominoes game to Willy Bank (Pacino)

APHA switching to second stage boosters

Yeah ok, looks like BABA sellers have run out of juice. We should be back around ~270 EOD.
Pulled out of PLTR up about 50%. Meh. Cash gang until I find the next play.
How is AAPL 2% up in this shaky market? It's usually the first one to dump
Where is Gandalf when you need him
This is your obligatory, buy the dip day. Just do it
SQ calls have to be the play. No reason it should be down 3% today
Why is it that it seems like a lot of times everything for thy day has already happened in premarket.
I told yall to sell PLTR while it was high.
Ok now Im mad at u NIO u piece of shit
Remember when everyone was hyping up PLTR on the weekend lol
Oh boys im red this not good me not gucci
Takeoff imminent 
Rlly rlly rlly good buying opportunity for NIO... like Im dead serious
To whoever was shilling PSTH Friday, thank you.
The Market took PLTR and CRSR behind the shed and shot in the back of their heads. Eyeballing GME next
lolz, did the same move as I did on Friday, let PLTR pump, then 0dte/weekly puts

Sorry PLTR bag holders... should have jumped and not got greedy
A single SPAC play that's plummeting like everything else I'm holding is the only thing keeping me from basically wiped out again. What a great day.
look at AMD doing a great job.  Good for you, AMD.
[deleted]
NKLA 20P WOOOO
RI0T puts? 
dip on DKNG? 
Be a gay bull and buy VXX calls.
SQ FDs cucking me so hard
I hopped off GME thinking of taking profits over to PLTR. Thoughts?
Limit market orders save me from myself
Jim Stewart: "Where is the inflation?"

Stocks and homes at all time highs, dollar weak. There's your inflation.
TSLA lets goooooooo baby volume looking nice for a melt up
If it werent for QS I wouldve been on the bread lines today, instead Im sipping Chateau Diana
Im a bitter bag holder at $25/share for RKT. But I would still buy this in the teens. $19 is unreal for this company. Just sayin
Okay Elon we get it now can you please just fucking moon?
Misjudged the real TSLA entry
Okay... who bought the top on that Tesla downhill. 
are we no longer buing PLTR calls?
i payed for being greedy on Friday...and I am definitely paying for it again today
U guys saying not to sell PLTR calls like the IV levels arent worse than Chernobyl radiation levels
Meme stocks are ripping me a new one today....
Yikes TSLA PLTR
Tesla holding up remarkably well against this selling pressure but it just keeps being bought up
TSLA about to make me broke broke

*Salutes sinking PLTR from ICLN life boat*

Godspeed you magnificent bastard
Stop bleeeeeding please

Some dips last for days.
Fucking gift of a dip. Buy until it hurts.
the nio pump is officially OVER
Im buying NIO
NOW THAT PLTR IS DEAD APHA
TSLA IS KILL FUCK MEEE
Too late to buy thicc bee at 12.75?
Mother of fucking dumps
PLTR killing my GME gains... at this point might break even eod
Rip Tsla calls..
Nikola is 100X more evil company than luckin coffee ever was. First a fake company, fake vehicle rolled down hill for PR. Then fake GM agreement with GM to prop up share price. And now stock offering right before GM deal cancellation. Why dont SEC delist and jail all Nikola people for such a massive fraud?
TSLA so sad :''''(
Who bought tsla at peak? Show yourself lol
Is nio a buy?
Damn left to drop off my son at daycare and was green. Look at my portfolio now all red. F
"Haha you thought THAT was the bottom? Watch this !" - CRSR
sold pltr puts for gme puts and greatly regretting it now FUCK
Market gives and market takes. Abs brutal.
today was not the day to get into pltr lol
NIO better pump those deliveries numbers up on the 2nd or tomorrow. Better not post those rookie numbers.
Tesla tryna make sure I lose all the money I made last week
Rkt glued to $20 support line
Ugh. Nioooo
First bear day in a while, enjoy it you gay boys
It's alright guys Congress is back for a special All-Talk-No-Walk session of stimmy talks. Projected to go well. 

Grab some PLTR shares on cheap and wait for all this to blow over.
Pltr to 23 then callssssssss
The sea was angry that day my friends.
Guys, you dont lose money in options if a stock goes down. Buy fucking puts if youre crying about calls and fuck the cash gang
is NKLA a scripted reality tv drama show? LOL
First time joining WSB meme train. GME calls. Turning reality on it's head
DKNG youre my only saving grace please don't do this
Entire watchlist went from green this morning to red.
This place is dangerous for someone with my mental state
everyone so sad while I'm printing hard with GME and my EV puts SPY puts QQQ puts and PLTR puts

sorry fellas but you gotta play what the market gives you
I guess its December loss tax write off
Getting warmed up for this sweet PLTR dip
Too late for gme?
FUCK U WHAT HAPPEN YO PLTR
There goes SPAC plays. Fuck this, I'm done.
Hold or sell gme 30c 12/18?
A lot of dips here to load up on for quick gains
AAPL 
Tesla may have hurt me today but I couldnt not buy again at this level for recovery back to 600. Unrealized losses are just hidden gains when it comes back.
Its ok theta is fucking PLTR bulls and bears tenderly and equally right now
Lmao why is AAPL green, it usually drills on red days
 I hope you stuffed your stockings with as many calls as you could. Christmas is gonna be early this year and tomorrow is December. <3
1hr into the market on a Monday and this place is falling apart....
I refuse to sell for a loss anymore everytime i do that shit gap up the next second
prime opportunity to grab some of your favorite stonks for a discount
wtf going on with NIO?
Spy could finish -2.5% today
"I lost money listening to WSB"

Depends on who you were listening to, there were bearish comments this morning telling you to stay out
VIX gang rise up... 
first red day in weeks MEOWWWWWWW
Pltre gang? Na bro pltr is now another theta gang bitch. Thanks for playing, drive on thu pltr call gang
Smallcaps bleeding hard was the thing last night that made me think today would actually be red. I think were seeing profit taking + shutdown fears right now. Congress needs to get their heads out of their asses and give us a fucking stimulus.
GME really is trying to dip.
So who didnt buy puts ?
So what isn't fucked today?
I hope everyone had a great weekend
December sell off most likely, we will be back in a few weeks
1 hr in, just a reminder for you weak brained panic tards.
Ameripoors are srsly amazing lol, EU got everyone rollin all well this morning then the american market decides to shit itself looooool

whatever, long live PSTH!!!
Big Brain: Selling CCs at peak euphoria for huge premiums on PLTR
Little Brain: Buying PLTR weeklies because "hey, let's ride the rocketship" god damn it

Bad day at the casino today

RH account was +25% at open. Now 8% and falling. Big oof.
Holy shit Im cash gang, I have to hold GME for 2 days or else I get a good faith violation. Oh fuck.
Hey boys. Remember February 17th? Could this be it?
Can we please stop dipping???
Bought Tesla 565ps when it was at 600 this morning and had a limit sell for 16. Cancelled the order and 30 minutes later it fucking executes once Tesla starts free-falling. Now they are worth 23+. Fuck you TD

For PLTR bag holders:

Imagine being so suborn that you go down with the ship. Not even captains in real life go down with the ship
What is happening?
Holy fuck

Surely, this cannot backfire!
Well damn. Goodbye all of last weeks gains.. 
Lol again, fuck you MSFT
Dont marry your bags
Taking a dirty dump in-sync with the market
Fuck I forgot to set my alarm
Stop limit orders that i hope wont be filled
Glad I sold my pltr calls Friday for a 5% loss, I would have been greedy and held. Nice
HAHAHAHAHAHA Retail always gets fucked in the end
This reminds me of when, in "The Hunt for Red October", that submarine went from -65 meters, to -935 meters in two minutes
Bought more pltr. Cant wait for sick returns in a yr
Tesla has me down 20% today. This is unfortunate.
Oh man this awesome! Just gonna take these SHOP profits and roll into QQQ calls on this dip

Bought just before the dump, very cool
Cash gang, whew

Anyone else using ETRADE have some transactions out in the abyss? Sold a TSLA call and my account balances page accounts for the sale, but it's not in my transaction history or in my 'cash available for investment' total.

DT6 is just refueling the drills, we ain't done yet
Nobody bought calls on the heavy research the NVAX DD guy gave us and instead bought PLTR calls and now were all dead lol. He was right though.

a hold of 18 is super bullish and is what I'm expecting however
indexes down, metals down, dollar down, oil down. All money is flowing to Biiitcoin and GME
What happened at 10:44? Not seeing any breaking news, was it just a technical rebound?
PLTR honey youre out of control

Market super red, SPY down almost down 1%. AMZN down on Cybermonday. TSLA green and PLTR almost green, stupid bears here telling me to sell PLTR and buy the GME top.
PLTR stuck at the 50% retracement of the drop from 30 to 24, all these round numbers are making me autistic
Imagine how much PLTR would moon if SPY was green today

AMD options are really hitting now. Just need PLTR to start climbing again, seems to be past the lows of the day.
Long calls on BABA are the way bois, even if they pass said bill it would it would give companies 3 YEARS to fall into line. it will probably pass but BABA isn't going anywhere
Amd
Healthy red days like today are an opportunity to buy more of the positions you believe in.

Also a lesson not to buy FDs with more money than your gambling allowance lmao

I had a new kind of wet dream, AMD 115 this week
Heres hoping Teslas just refueling to get back to its Mars mission.
Picked up some PFE calls. Approval has to be coming soon.
AMD is $80. Its not the new PLTR. H C A C $13 climbed from $10 while volume 8xed and now its headed for $150. H C A C not the new anything other than a fucking rocket
Will all Chinese stocks be wiped out?
I sold AMD on Friday hoping to buy the dip today. Why does my life have this kind of luck
Got Jan 2022 leaps for PLTR. Watched some videos on them and they look like a serious legit firm working with the CIA. The CIA will not let them down
Damn Lisa girl you looking fine today
BABA is forming a classic L pattern, this means that we should take it
If I'm ever down $1234 on something I just yell party time and it's actually a fun loss

AMD HOLY FUCK LOOK AT YOUR HUGE GREEN DICK
So what weed stock should I buy?
ZM popping at earnings or nah?
Please go up
5% day gain is abnormal for AMD in recent weeks. Something is up. Somebody out there knows something we don't. Wouldn't be surprised if it reaches 100 EOW. It's only about 8% away.
they don't call this place Wrong Speculations Boogaloo for nothing
Can we get some FUCKING VOLUME. Im bored
Can one measly Citron really best the entirety of WSB?  Where is the strength? Or are all these posts just the hot air of paper handed p\*\*\*\*\*\*?  We are really letting down the poor helpless intel community, let's go! 
Holy crap I think I sold my AMD 88 call at the top. Can't see it going past $92ish so I'll take that profit thanks.
Did Schwab pull a Robinhood and close the option market at 12 because they didnt change Fridays coding?
SPY only up like .5% from the lows of the day. But feels like a bigger recovery.

Can we get some volume on these pumps?

Sue bae or mama cathie woods?
Anyone else buy a weed penny stock just to watch it move?
You need to be buying CGC here.
Bought a TSLA 650c weekly at 585 to try and get some help by swinging within the day, figuring we'd seen the typical mid-day moon rocket, especially being this close to 600, and of course it proceeded to drop and now it's flat as fuck after a slight resurgence. I *was* going to buy a few PTON calls instead but I didn't think it'd have a reason to rocket up to 110 let alone 112. What the fuck man
HEXO jumped 17% today, and one of Robinhood's "most traded", assuming one of you degenerates is the cause for this?
BABA literally hasnt moved all day
Zoom $300 once vaccine got FDA approval
Why the fuck does Roku only go up
Are we buying weed because optimism the bill will pass? or just a sell the news kind of thing? I dont follow. I also dont see the benefit to Canadian weed stocks. Can they apply for business loans too if mj gets decriminalized in the US?

stonks taking afternoon nap
Managed to buy $PSTH @ the top today. 700 shares @ 27.27. Have another 11k Im tempted to dump i to it @ 26.. But thinking ill save that for if it takes a bigger step backwards this week. Would hate to buy more @ 26 and watch it go to 24 or lower
It would be funny to sell weeklies on AMZN to get about 2,000$ per week
So why is everything flat for hours? 

Place your bets? Step right up? 50/50 or theta gang wins?
PTON, LULU and FSLY about to launch

Went from -6% to +2%. Not bad. DO YOUR PART AND BUY GME
Buy Wallmart
Next time benzinga has a prep stock of the day it would be wise to go all in then sell like 15 mins later, this is my new strategy
I have a weird feeling ZM could skyrocket but the way the market is right now it would beat crazy and drill 10% to fuck call holders
spy dipping, looks good? or nah just day trade SPY buy on dips sell rips lol
Hello SQ
Hold TSLA weeklies overnight? I am down about 5k on them
Q's up for the day. BABA still anchored into the ground.
buying 100 shares of pltr and selling an fd when it was at 26.95 this morning wasn't too bad of a play. made some beer money easy peasy
Green by EOD this is getting too obvious
Bought more PLTR
Has PLTR forsaken us, or were we the ones that failed PLTR? 
I'm ready to be hurt again AAPL

Is tonights S&P/TSLA announcement gonna be a sell the news?
Anyone know patent/IP laws well?

I want to make a shirt with Citron Researchs logo on it making fun of them. Maybe Shitron Research or something using their logo. Is that against copyright laws or considered libel?
ZM earnings profit -> DOCU earnings profit

Cash gang sleep well at night
Lol.

There's been 15 times as many shares traded on a weed penny stock worth less than a dollar than what PLTR has moved today.
When WSBers start feeling the stress of uncertainty, you know MMs have been sweating for a week. All it's going to take is one needle to pop this bubble and it's September 2nd all over again. Don't be in weeklies
At what point do I just take the L and sell BABA
AY PEE X TEE IS THE PLAY HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU RETARDS
We do not know WORKs acquisition price since it will be released tomorrow AH, correct?

So RIOT gonna make us rich now?
Calling all Beckys, all Beckys report for duty
When will MSFT rip up like AAPL.. its unfair
Unity valuation is now 6x its pre ipo valuation! Good job retards
I wonder who is looking at NKLA going, "Hmmm, that seems like a real smart buy."
MJ ACB yes.
IWM puts seem like a decent idea with how overextended it is on daily/weekly, but knowing this market, itll probably hit $190 this week
Just bought NKLA puts! Im not too late am I?
I don't know if any of you bought Oblong based on my now-labelled-spam DD, but I hope a few of you fuckers did. It was $5.20 a share when I posted it like two hours ago. Now it's at $11.60 and rising. For the record I do not have any idea why this happened.
Every one buying tesla calls i think i might inverse the sub and load up on puts, the smallest negative sentiment coming out at 5:15 will tank the stock.
How fucked am I for holding PLTR and NIO overnight?
So many people are going to hate themselves for being too chicken shit to get rick by loading up on $TSLA and $SPY calls.

I said gold bottomed at  1870

So today, for the sake of posterity, I'm gonna say that gold has further downside from here... could perhaps go to 0 or even go negative. That's right, COMEX will pay you to take delivery of gold bars.
MGNI TO THE MOOOON

Good time to add to my MSFT positions seeing strong holiday sales for Xbox
The only things keeping the market up are AAPL, AMD, and WWE.
Here I was thinking yesterday to cut down on my 20K position in Apple shares and use some to buy PepsiCo. 
If youre bagholding zoom and didnt sell at 480 you deserve a swift kick to the nuts
If rocket breaks 20.83 Ill get back in because Im a sucker for punishment and because I actually think this shit is undervalued
Still time to buy the dip, SPY on sale for cyber Monday before the gap up in futures tonight

ZM straight cliffdiving rn
A buddy of mine told me that GM back out of Nikola deal as they didnt have any product to manufacture. Now the deal is just to supply fuel cells and there is no committed volume there. So nikola is clearly fake.
Well, today was super fucking flat for me. My put hedges balanced out my long call loses
Just need APHA to hit ath this week to revive my account after BABA destroyed it.
I laugh at anyone who thought TSLA wouldnt break 600, I called it yesterday that it would premarket.
PLTR shaking off the paper hands. It's opening hour after a long weekend and all the markets are down. Probably will stay around $28 today, and rise up later this week on a green day.
Everyone losing hope on PLTR is boosting my confidence
PLTR drilling

Its down less than 2%, relax. A couple red days is nothing in the kind of run up this thing has had
I really dont give a fuck - Im gobbling up these PLTR dips - averaging down like a hungry hippo 

Thankfully the PLTR shills are going to be washed out of this subreddit by the end of the day. That was an annoying week

GME will happen next week
PLTR on route to DESTROY AMZN and AAPL. Fucking boomer stonks

Buying a dying company at the all time high it's a very solid strategy
Pltr gang gets what it fucking deserves for spamming all weekend
To the fucking moron that dumped GME, fuck you

We thought Palantir was the meme, but the people pumping that stock were the meme the entire time
Stop saying buy the dip the only thing you are catching is a falling knife.
Good job pltr dip buyers!
LET'S MAKE PLTR GREEN AGAIN :D   ^(\^ )
ban all people who spam a non-existent PLTR rumor
Bought 27 shares of GME at $18.04. Hope this wasnt a mistake
Thank GOD HYLN IS DONE. FUCK THAT PETER GRIFFIN LOOKING CEO
Hey PLTR if you wanna get back to green thatd be cool too
GME cant keep Xboxs and PS5 on the shelf. Big time earnings coming up. Not a believer ? Go try to buy a new console RN
Not worried about my PLTR calls, the stock needed to take a fucking breather after such gains. $35 EOW
Maaaaan I waited the whole fucking weekend for a god damn dumpster fire followed by a 5 hour period flatter than a fuckin 2x4.
Im in disbelief. I actually bought more puts at the very bottom today. And my puts are now down 70%. Wasted another paycheck. Yeah Im seriously done this time. No point in continuing to lose money.
About to sell all my PLTR and just buy more GME & 
It was a bull trap? 

Always has been 
Im glad I didnt get a chance to FOMO into GME
I always enjoy when a meme stock hits its inevitable top and watching all the retards scream "DIAMOND HANDS!!!!!! SELLING IS FOR PUSSIES!!!!!!" as they ride their +1000% contracts into -100%. It's unreal how good some of you are at taking winning plays and still managing to lose money on them, lmao
Mods mad at A Pee Ex Tee damn get in on these gains
Why GME so high tho
SHOP about to go into the stratosphere. $2.4b one day merchant sales Black Friday. Last year they did 2.9B from Black Friday - cyber Monday.

Jesus fuck

Wouldn't be surprised if PLTR just kinda chills for awhile and on the next bit of news just fucking rockets again
If you autists miss GME you will never forgive yourselves.
GME easily still a buy. Easily easily easily. Still so early in this shit. The turnaround hasn't begun.

Petition to replace JPow running meme with one of Ryan Cohen.
APHA, if you love money and some ganja.
PLTR makes my PP hard
Gme just beginning boys !

Edit: lol immediately tanked 10s after I posted
I'm outta PLTR so that you guys can get tendies when it soars after
This is why you go into PLTR by buying stock not insane 1 week OTM calls.

Once COVID is over, buy puts. People will realize their life still sucks
Why the fuck are you silk-paper-handed Murricans selling everything
You idiots selling palantir for GameStop are doing this to me
Waiting for the cucks who said theyd buy the PLTR dip 
I see why people spam tickers in the chat now this is kinda fun, like the guy watching the horse race slapping his thigh with the newspaper and yelling in a Bdubs
Okay now PLTR is starting to look bad.
PLTR weekly call holders, how y'all holding up?
People in here thinking GME is a standard "Pump it to the moon then dump" stock instead of a solid normal investment with a chance to squeeze it to the moon 
Remind me never to fuck with fucking meme stocks again
Still holding PLTR, citron values it long term.
PLTR WHYY
I hope PLTR gang sold at open
Those $27 PLTR puts I bought at 945 are looking good. 

Will sell at $25.

Trusted my gut and got out of PLTR at 27.75. Thank god lol
NIO u son of a Fucking Asian bitch if u wanna be better than Tesla, then just go up retard
In the end, the big hedge funds that got into PLTR at $10-15 win, and "Reddit traders" lose. Although Cramer made it sound like Reddit was winning, in the end, Cramer works for big money. Where are the profit takers? Where are the sellers? Oh wait, they sold already.
Temporary dips it'll all be green by eod
I was told that stonks only go up

$WFC book value is $33 per share. Most banks are trading 50% above book value. Analysts have quietly been upgrading the stockexpecting a short term target of $32 and a one year target of $45. Debit spreads will net you 200-400% gain over the next six months. Dont say I didnt tell you.
I think PLTR is done for now...  whats up next beside GME?

MSTR HOLY SHIT IM GONNA FUCKING CUM 
Hold GME above 17, fellas. Keep the pressure on these MF's necks.
APHAs for the ALPHAs
RIP to those who FOMOd GME at the top.

Rotation out of meme stocks into actual businesses

Fuckin pump n dump weed stocks keeping ev down
Someone give me an EOD 10 bagger.
I just bailed out on my AAPL calls so it can finally break out over 121.  You are all very welcome.  Enjoy your tendies.
Someone make up something provocative about why PLTR is stuck at $27 all day long to make me feel better about myself.
Hold my 12/4 27c on PLTR over night? Im down 20%
I missed the entire PLTR train. Is it safe to get on now?
Pltr flatlined
Puts on ZM just because I only use teams
Is tesla climbing down because of the SP announcement later today? Because that's pretty ghey.
 GME till I at least hit 1000% 
wtf is going on with GME?
The casino is closing in 15 minutes guys
You guys tricked me on pltr and now tsla.

Don't put your faith in a dead company like gamestop
Damn, getting tempted to yolo on TSLA 1/15 600C.
Tesla wont see a day under $600 starting tomorrow. Fear not, WE SHALL OVERCOME!
GME cancelled I suppose 
Bullish af day on PLTR
I got ZM 420p wish me luck
Im heading over to my local GME and asking for a refund
I kinda feel bad for all the newbies getting trolled by GME pumpers they actually believed there would be a short squeezer (something that has 0.01% chance of happening right now)
PLTR
Pro Tip:

Market has basically been closed for 4 days (Friday was a nothing burger). 

Dont jump on any position at 9:30. Shit is going to jump in one direction and violently reverse within 5-10 minutes.

Wait.
Fellas,

We need to prove our worth.  Lets get PLTR to $34 by EOD
If you tards stop selling your 20 shares of PLTR for 50 bucks we could actually move up
PLTR closing green today
PLTR rumour confirmed: This week, we plan to submit to the US FDA an emergency use authorization for our COVID-19 vaccine. Preliminary results from our phase 3 trial demonstrate that out vaccine is 99% effective.
If GME doesnt open $20 tmrw Im jumping off a bridge
Everyone spamming pltr all weekend are about to learn what  theta gang lmaooo
GME the new PLTR?
Pltr is gonna pump so hard today
Please someone tell me Pltr will be 35 by the end of the week..
$PLTR POWER HOUR IS COMING BOYS. THE ROCKET IS ABOUT LAUNCH 
LMAO woke up to a notification about an option being exercised 

I did not realize my broker auto-magically exercises options when ITM.

Guess who is the proud owner of 100 shares of WORK at $40

I am tired of losing, being a loser i work so hard so fooking hard like 18Hrs a day 7days a Week at work! And i am still loseing! Why am i on this earth 
I have a $30 PLTR call exp 12/4 and I need PLTR to moon
Y'all... I'm going to do one of those "if ____ closes at ___" things. Like the PS5 guy

If TSLA closes at$650 today I'll pay my mortgage.  That's it 
get the pltr dip as soon as the bell hits
some people just aren't cut out for things like GME and that's fine just go join r/investing

this thing is going to the moon whether you like it or not and all you have to do is hold
Jumping out the palantir   into GME 
Tuscan to the 
GME DONT WEAK HANDS THIS BITCH, THIS IS A 10 BAGGER IF YOU HOLD
I bought Ford calls and then Morgan and Stanley popped up and shit on them as a stock.  Then I buy PLTR calls and immediately Citron shits on them too and they also dive.  Like damn can you guys shut the fuck up
We're MOONING!!
We're TANKING!!!

-Zooms out to monthly graph-

Narrator: "They were doing neither."
The 23 downvoters of my comment on Palantir dipping, just letting you know that your tears are providing as good lube for my rock hard schlong
While you guys just got completely pumped and dumped on $pltr by those who have been in since the teens

Other people are making money off $gme $apha $snow $shop $nnox etc

Taking their profits and just buying more $pltr shares lol 

When you chase parabolic stocks you need to make sure you give yourself time. Not weekly calls just because everyone on this subs keeps screaming buy buy buy
No stake in PLTR, but I really wanted to watch that guy eat his own shit...
How are the PLTR calls boys? The calls that you downvoted everyone who was slightly bearish about it for the entire weekend?
should we buy mor PLTR dips?
BUY PLTR YOU FUCKING DEGENERATES WHY WOULD YOU LOSE HOPE A LITTLE VOLUME AND WERE BACK IN THE GREEN
PLTR WILL RECOVER. FUCK THE WEAK HANDED, WEAK MINDED AND POOR FAT FUCK BEARS
Just goes to show how gullible you all are for low volume premarket pumps.
We going to be bigly green by close.
When were all PLTR millionaires, Ill throw $100 bills that I used to wipe my ass at the bears
U guys fucking kidding me? Selling PLTR? itll be a $500 stock in 2025 lmao weak hands
I am not thrilled about the PLTR dump today but it reminds me of why I have 03/19s instead of FDs.
#Lots of nerds reading rules in here, probably the same people that reported RH to the SEC for suggesting positions to you because they lost money on a suggested TSLA iron condor. 

Nice job those projected  profit graphs used to look fresh
There is no Palantir rumour - there is however max pain on options near $27 which is interesting because the current price.... oh, would you look at that..  is $27

* slow blink *
Down 3k this morning now up 1k this shit is taking years off my life
HOLD DA LINE PLTR RIDERZ OF ROHIRRIM INCOMING
kinda disappointed in GME today , not gonna lie
On June 29, 2010, **Tesla** Motors launched its **initial public offering** on NASDAQ. 13,300,000 shares of common **stock** were issued to the public at a **price** of US$17.00 per share. The **IPO** raised US$226 million for the company.

I'm not gonna say it you already know what I'm hinting at.
yall said GME was getting the big squeeze. I was promised a squeeeee
Say it with me:

Apple calls are free money
Hi WSB I found you on the front page. you guys promised me GME would be $100 today. well I bought 5 shares at $19.31 , and now i'm down $10. this is unacceptable, my dad is going to be so mad. Im going to go start a petition.
I got $80 buying power
Palantirians stand back and stand by! 
Can we get a fake buyout rumor about GME just start spamming that Nintendo is buying them out then tomorrow someone will post it on their news site.
APHA gonna moon
King plantard here, 
Anyone else down 3k on PLTR calls? 
Boy am I cheerful for the refuel mission 
If you played ZM calls you deserve this.
GME is not a short squeeze just a p&d change my mind
Paid for WiFi on this flight just to watch numbers go up and talk shit with you retards. Beats watching Netflix.
Buy GME right now for a 100% quick gain

Anyone getting zoom puts today??? Or just me?
Enough about PLTR, whats TSLA DOING TODAy???
Fuck you NIO. Youve cucked me so many times I should change my name to Andrew Left
Be smart broskis. Hoping for a stock to go up without any clear catalyst is same as gambling. Get off PLTR now and hop on another stock, there will be more rockets to ride.
My girls sending me all this stuff for the 4 seasons in Bora Bora like I dont spend all our money on 0dte SPY calls smh
I hate when you want to buy something but its up 11% pre-market :( wtf gme
i love ICLN lol
All I gotta say it, FUCK CITRON!!! Those market rigging assholes!!!
JUST BOUGHT GME CALLS. HOLY SHIT UP 16%
APHA
GME 19.20!!
Holy shit GME breaking the $20 wall at open?!?!
I cant even buy GME.. stuck on pending. Too much demand
PLTR gonna break $30 today

How much longer we holding on PLTR now
will thc bee ever do anything lmao
I wish my broker had self exclusion like my gambling platforms, I just want to all in TSLA/PLTR/THIC B/PSTH and lock my account for 5 years to prevent paper hands
Anyone else selling Pokmon cards to fund their stock market gambling addiction? I hate my childhood AND my wallet 
Fuck yes APHA. The shorts are going to get fucked.
I wanna get in this GME action but it just seems overpriced, missed the jump in on Friday. I will not fomo again, great way to lose money
 the coin broke ath
PLTR you got this Im not sweating it
Reloaded Tsla 600c on that dip. They've already tested 600 and gonna moon more and more until Dec 18 when the indexes need to buy 100bln of Tesla stonks at market value lol. 3 weeks of uppies.
my PLTR weeklies dead?
Cmon thiccb break $13!!
Who else here is getting cucked by NIO
Everyone deserves to make a little money. My little bear friends, I wish you serenity, but I would strongly recommend taking a bullish position on PLTR before end of year. Now is your chance. Look at all the market manipulation that big money is having to do to save the shares they wrote their 12/18 30C on - they're paddling against the current, and only managing to *just* save themselves from capsizing! Look at the ignorant ass level of Open Interest on those calls! You still have time to cash out your 25P and...get ready for it...buy shares. The palantards are throwing you a life preserver tied to a rocket ship.

**ride with us to the heart of the sun and be obliterated in God**
Going cash gang, this is spoopy
Too late for APHA calls?
hey retards, now is not the time to give up on GME, shit just started. time to be strong. NO PAPER HANDS ALLOWED
Another TSLA buying opportunity...don't miss this one.  I think it'll be the last one today.
down to 2k I need to make it back to 20k soon what's the play
PLTR was so last week, GME is the new PLTR baby
Too late to jump into GME?
Usually takes two days to bounce back from Citron nonsense (see Nio and Blnk); expecting bounce back to 32 tomorrow or Wednesday for PLTR
can we pump FCEL alil bit? asking for a friend
Thinking about short term GME puts to fund GME calls later
Lmfao my account swings from Tesla today are unreal so far
I was told PLTR would give tendies today wtf
NKLA deal with GM is basically dead. No Badger development, no equity stake, just the fuel cell technology they say they have that's basically vaporware. Trevor Miltons 93 million shares unlocked today. Burn trash.
How much would a single guy need to retire in a shithole country Im 25 with 150k in s&p500 could I retire now in a shithole country
PaLaNtaRdz RiSe uP!!!1!!1
bought more PLTR leaps, down 20 already lmao
Man, what an overall bearish day. And all to a sprained ankle. 

What will the markets do when Grampa Biden falls down the stairs the first time?!
All my calls are dead! Push me to the edge
I feel like Clark Griswald when he got the jelly of the month club instead of his big Christmas bonus.
God damn fuck the profit taking
It was all good just a ~~week~~ 30 mins ago 
stupid fucking gay bears
We're in fucking free fall
Palantards letting a month of gains be wiped because they dont know the words sell or withdrawal. Hate to see it
PLTR and NIO really misbehaving. My calls are for 04.11. 

This trend would better change in the course of the week
whatever pltr, could've made 2.5k but made 1.8k
Got the fuck out of everything
Down 23% on my PLTR calls. Down 52% on my PLTR puts. YEAH this shit makes sense.
isnt it funny that a stock could go up 3x in three weeks, and autists here would have lost all their money if it just goes down 15% over a couple of days
Thicccc boi keeping me alive   
pltr top 5 pump and dump of all time
And today half of wsb was wiped out
If your not in the GME game, you aint black

Came on here to see the PLTR meltdown. Was not disappointed.
really glad I sold my PLTR calls at this morning's peak
This shit is free falling fast
We may never see a green day ever again
Sector rotation from PLTR to GME
FUCK I CANT STOP BUYING PLTR just grabbed 400 more shares
Thank fucking godddddd I just have shares
The new kids who came in and bought PLTR last week are now all wiped out lmao. 

First ones free and you should have sold
Whoever tf is selling off on solar just Bc Bidens ankle is such a pussy
This is just the big boys taking profits and hedging via rotation. Everything green EOD (except NKLA all my homies short NKLA)
So where do I put my paper hands PLTR money?  GME?
Should be some good PLTR loss posts coming over the next few days
Just a red day guys, stop worrying about individual ticker drops. All gonna recover
PANIC SELL PANIC SELL PANIC SELL PANIC SELL PANIC SELL
PLTR officially killed my GME gains... in the red with u retards now smh
Oooooh nooooo, im only up 50% on my PLTR shares now
LOL - felt better to sell PLTR than it did to make money on it.
Back to $10 for PLTR I guess.
I called it on Thursday to sell. No one listed, I spoke the truth and they hated me for it
Literally 17% away from doubling my account 
Lmao at citron owning wsb
I cant wait for all the PLTR loss porn
Losses -6K PLTR shares and calls.

\-2300 AMZN shares and calls.

Gains 

Still +128 GME call 12/4.  

I'm holding it all.
everyone crying about GME is A PAPER HANDED PUSSY

it needed to backtest the trading channel that it was in and it's looking solid right now 

just hold
5 hours of trading left and a whole lot of account value to lose
bought pltr at 24.2 hell yeah
How many of you PLTR bois looking at that "insert coin to continue" screen this morning ?
Feeling pretty lucky to be a PLTR share holder right now and not an FD Retard
PLTR RECOVER INBOUND FUCK YOU 's

 YOUR CALLS BULLS
PLTR SAID WHAT DIP
TSLA AND PLTR v shaped bounce
APHA roaring back!
they got a vaccine for a dead cat?
I somehow don't feel like this is done for the day. That was a fucking **DRILL**, and will spook the algos into selling during power hour. 

For the rest of the week, a over 1% dump in the overheated American markets will likely give Asia and Europe some cause for concern. 

Tomorrow will be red too.
If you aren't at least hedging a lil for a downturn before New Years you're doing it wrong. I'm dick deep long on everything, but I always keep keep a spare thousand laying around for some short term protection for times like these. COVID cases goin nutty and Thanksgiving just ended... prepare for the numbers to get worse. Will this actually dip the market? The last 8 months tell me no, but I'll bet $1k that we see a 3%+ dip before 12/15.
Christmas is early! Stocking filled with $TSLA calls! I'm comfy as hell.
PLTR 30c 12/4 LETS GOOOO
PLTR, DKNG, GE and OSTK are calls I just bought into. Let's get weird.
Ok who is selling gme?
Sentiment here is still **overwhelmingly** bullish for PLTR. 

I'll hold these puts.
If CRSR can just have a nice rally I'll start donating my semen instead of eating it all myself.
Imagine panic selling.

Sitting on 1000 shares of PLTR, sold weekly covered calls at open and closed them during the dip when they became worthless. Done for the day, imma go take a nap.
THC Banned has a nice buy in point right now.
As they say here in Tennessee, pray the gay (bears) away.
People saying buy PLTR dip. Bro what dip. Nothing is dipped everything is basically still green. Fuck this
I might be totally off but pltr looks really bad setup to get in at this point.. i hope you retards drive it up bigly... cmon wsb prove our strength 

On the other hand, i have never seen strength like this @gme
Buy the dip you fairies!

NIO 12/18 Call, PLTR 12/18 Call, TSLA 12/18 Call
Fuck it back into PLTR just under 27. Ill hold for as long as I need to til it hits a solid 40
I cant believe yall overreacted so strongly for a Monday morning sell off
Need more volume on TSLA
I fucking love buying the dip
So who bag holded there puts 
Okay so PLTR went down 10% until I started listening to https://youtu.be/-nTkcVBbfSg
I'm not superstitious but I believe if I keep listening to soulja boy that PLTR will continue to go up. Thoughts?
I got cucked and sold pltr calls 
Double down on PLTR?
I only trust Apex in this market
Reckoning!

 **The Fed and the promise of a vaccine aren't enough to protect investors from a 'reckoning,'**: Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens' College University        of Cambridge and economic adviser to Allianz     warns
Frankly speaking.. closed my pltr positions at 300$ loss. This set up is not good for entry. We need to find the bottom.. and I see us testing the 25s again.. 

The last time I said this, pltr made new highs 
SPY going to 285 by Christmas according to my crayons
GM no longer staking Nikola
Why are you still messing with GME and PLTR when AAPL could easily gap up to $130 on blowout sales?
Sorry to whoever bought my PLTR weekly calls at the top last week lmao
APHA reversing
TSLA with the T shape recovery
CHEWY is my savior today, my doggo getting some extra treats
Whats with the big dip at 10:45? There is a V in all my tech stocks bottoming out at 10:45
If you had to sacrifice either PLTR or GME, which would you sacrifice and why
All hail the Fed! The mighty Fed! The SPY juicer King, the Bloated Pig that just keeps getting fatter, the ballon that will never pop, the Fat Lady will never stop singing, God Bless the Fed, we will never see sub 360 again!!
Fukk fed n rich ppl desperados too keep tis sh1t up.
Making a loss on crsr but I'm holding for 12 months. Stonks only go up right?
DO I KEEP HOLDING APEX OR WHAT. DUMPED IN TOTAL ABOUT 30K IN THIS BULLSHIT.
Are we getting an epic eod dump or what?
I guess PLTR joining theta gang
Wtf, the Motley Fool podcasts are actually alright. Some sort of insightful stuff in there
I'm so sick of holding shit stocks that go up and down 20% every week for for months on end... Give me some stocks that go +5% a day everyday for 6 months please.
Tesla had great news today about production and sales in China. Only reason they fell today is because the market across the board tanked. If you think this is the top for Tesla, I feel sorry for you. Tesla $700 OEY.
pLtR rUmOr
Lets get some PSTH hypeee
3/4 of the time when a meme/penny stock has massive interest/volume then just sits for hours, its about to die and plummet. Strong hands are not in these stocks. Ive seen this song and dance before.
C'mon WSB, we are a much more powerful force that Citron and his followers. They are attempting to prevent PLNTR from re-entering the channel. Need to get PLTR supported at $27.5 to continue upward trend!!!!

Whoever keeps buying my CCs.. thanks

APHA rising again.
Anyone else sleep in late? What a waste. Anyway ctrl+f PLTR. Only 9 matches weird.
Fellow GMErs what date do I sell my covered call
Ngl AAPL  has been quiet, Im loading up here
Yea so volume obviously slowing down, I think everyones gonna buy EOD for the rest of the week. no way theres a sell off at these prices, thatd be atrocious 
I'm not making any moves until next week. This week is gonna be fugly.
How is this thread not talking about weed stocks rn, if you want a hype industry for the week then there is nothing better than anything marijuana related. House voting on a bill to remove it as a schedule 1 drug which is huge cause this is the first time that such a bill is being voted on. APHA is looking like it's gonna have back to back 10% green days. If you lost money on PLTR then this is the perfect way to get your money back. Literally can't go tits up
How are MMs still selling GME calls? Like why when literally anything else is safer
Sundial growers
CRSR green!!!!
CRSR shriek dildo confirmed

If the GME short squeeze happens this sub will definitely be shut down by the SEC lol
Index funds are allowed to start buying Tesla tomorrow. FDs are the play
Sold puts on GME, and loads of CCs on PLTR. This is meme stock bliss
ICLN is like that kid that always builds himself up and thinks hes gonna last for 40 mins, then at open he blows his load Immediately, and then he builds his confidence back up through the day.

He always cums though.
Thought Tesla would have more volume td tbhh
TSLA gang - expect an S&P inclusion update at 5:15 today.  Rally party afterwards.  
CRSR bears go fuck yourselves with a concrete dildo. You got like 25 percent of the stock price lopped off in 2 days, fuck off somewhere else.
I guess buying CRSR today was a mistake after all.
Blows my mind that Nasdaq can be green today.
People who fomod into GME this morning getting cucked
never thought i see the day SPY is forgotten wsb is all just meme stocks now :/
Put everything you have into apple calls for the spring. Strike price doesnt even matter
STOP what you are doing and BUY AAPL right now
Going hard in the paint on AMD and CHWY

Fomoing GME was not the movee at the top  good thing i got 12 /24s tho
tim apple
GME talks not going well
why would AH announcement regarding TSLA impact share price? basically they are just deciding whether or not to add the stock in one day vs two days? or do we just expect it to moon because it's a meme stonk?
***DUHHHHHHH....PLTR IS A $5,000/SHARE STOCK MINIMUM....DUHHHHH. OH LOOKIE AT THE TIME, LIZARD LICK TOWING IS ON NOW! TOODLES!***
Dump hour 
What in Jesus Butt-Fucking Christ was that Green candle?
Bought another 500 GME, huge opportunity here
S&p gonna kick out amazon and replace it with tsla 
cauliflower rice is disgusting and should not exist.
Not too late to buy ZM calls
aapl going to $130 by christmas
I did the math and if we all buy 20 shares of GME it will cause a short squeeze to the moon. Trust me Im a rocket engineer 
When nearly the entire market pulls back simultaneously for no apparent reason other than it being the last day of the month - you know this shit's fake af lol.
I've always hated everything about apple and never had anything but android. But if AAPL keeps this run going I might switch.
TSLA 500p 12/4 locked and loaded. F me
Guys lets ride apple to 130, we can pump this into Valhalla!
CRSR recovery when
**AAPL** $135 by EOW
I was the last person to buy GME @18 ama
Please talk me out of 20k yolo to Tesla right now please
pltr went to lunch and uber driver murdered him on the way back
Should I fomo into TSLA? 30 minutes left to decide my fate 
I cant wait for all the newbie traders on here to ignore the huge discount on NIO/Xpeng and then when the catalysts happen this month in the biggest bull month of the year that every competent trader saw coming drives the price up over 80 by NIO day and they all complain damn why didnt I buy it at -25% of fair value then they FOMO at the top AGAIN and paper hands when it dips 5% god I love this game never change WSB keep making me rich with your Wendys paychecks you blow on stupid moves
Who's nervous about holding TSLA calls through announcement?
The thread is gonna be toast tonight.  Yall put money on PLTR and should be getting into APHA
Zero big news for stocks to be tanking rn this is a buy opportunity
I think PLTR holders might need therapy after todays movement.

For asking why would anyone buy at this time LOL
APHA Mooning, get in before $9

People buying GME but selling PLTR. Makes sense
Why am I getting trending notifications from the cocksmokers at r/conservative?
GME really scammed us like how they do it in store
Just wanna give y'all the finger for convincing me to go in on pltr
Fuck yall
Wanna know something fucked? I lost 90% of my capital purely from trading, without even using options lmao

PLTR is ripe for AH selloff this week.
I only bought 5 GME call contracts last Friday for Jan 21 C18. Only five but the upside looks crazy if the squeeze actually rockets this up to $500 a share. Then My upside is turning $1,610 into $230k.

Guggenheim Funds Trust filed an amendment with the SEC to allow its $5 billion Macro Opportunities Fund to gain exposure to shitcorn by investing up to 10% of the funds net asset value in the Grayscale B Trust (GTC).
Do you guys who yell "dELiSt" read anything besides the headline? If it passes the house the companies have 3 years before they have to comply with US auditing rules.

None of my strikes are breached. Nothing changes but a huge negative Maintenance Excess? Hopefully this shit will resolve itself once trading start.

I even got a damn margin call text. Anyone with a Tasty account with this issue?

What are some good dates for GME?
Can dudes wear Tesla short shorts? All the pics I see are of chicks
Ok mother phukers  you ready
Everyone who's enjoying GME's ride be wary and don't FOMO in too much. The oracle who posted their positions on GME earlier this year has calls up till 19, and with such a strong play by them I wouldn't play expecting it to go over 20.  

Stay safe out there.
I bet a lot of people here have some seriously weird pre-open rituals. Like I imagine seeing whether your lizard eats or which side of the yard your dog shits on are two of the more normal ones.
Lets go GME

My quick CRM earnings scalp has gone full 737. Good buy in time whenever it stabilizes though.

MRNA today is exactly why when people say "priced in" they dont know shit.  If the market prices in anything, this surge would not have occurred.  It's just a casino

Was thinking about buying some weekly ZM puts for earnings, but this shit is so fucking expensive. But the desire to score a win on a crash of this shitstock is so fucking high, please somebody tell me that this is some kind of sort of revenge/hate-trading or something and that I shouldn't be doing it pls.
RAD bout to moon

Bought and held a GME call for about 7 min this morning, took 50% gain and walked away

I really just think today is a weird day. I expect the week to be green so I'm not dumping anything but will probably just buy some dips and call it a day
Wheres everyone thinking GameStop will end up this week.  A lot of talk about it lately on here
Glad Im not going to be the bag holder for PLTR. TSLA back on the menu.

Is TSLA correcting or dumping? I bought this morning at 601 lol
Well rip me. I bought 2 Tesla calls this morning on the bottom of that first dip
The comments in here are fascinating compared to last week and the week before lmfao
Limbooooooooo
Tsla dump so the big boys get a good price tomorrow?

On Friday I bought a PLTR put and planned to use my last day trade. Accidentally bought two because robinhood is gay. Ended up having to hold one put over the weekend. Thank god for being retarded
Accumulate shares. 

Options are too risky on a parabolic stock unless you are buying leaps 

If a stock is up 300% in a few months. You think buying weeklies is the smart thing to do? Seriously ?
##LOL 
Everything is in the red lol
The lady on CNBC said sticky lol

Anyone else's WeBull down? I tried to buy the dip and I'm getting shafted hard and can't sell

Not a gay bear here, just a dumb bull, but expect another one of these days tomorrow.
PLTR will overcome you retards. Buy now.
*Capitan, are all the bears in the trap? We are ready to launch the counter-offensive on Musks' order.*

Buying AMD at 90 was the wrong move
Holy J POWELL
Let's make $ now
Spy really just pumped over a dollar in 6 minutes
What a way to wake up monday morning
What I love about this sub is that the DD is there and its good, but the fomo'ers buy in too late with 2DTE OTM calls and lose everything. Everyone who's getting wiped out on a ticker today doesn't realise everyone from a month ago is still deep ITM
NIO will never disappoint
Wtf was the point for all that? Was there even a reason we ranked to hard?
VIX call holders, wyd?
What are you guys getting on cyber monday
Everything coming back
Todays a good day to enter donkey Kong if anyone is interested
NNDM JUST DIPPED BUY IT WHILE U CAN
hope you bought z dip
AMCI. Buy a little.
Anyone elses Etrade not working at all right now?! WTF
Timed the CRSR bottom to perfection. $35 to the cent, so if this fucker goes lower Im gonna slap somebody and its probably going to be Andrew Left
Stock market disappoints me more than how much I disappoint my parents everyday. Shame on you stock market. shame on you
tsla now
Why why why why why why why why why why why why
Make aapl great again

I am thankful I only have shares in PLTR, but seeing red is never cool. I guess it helps that my only move is to hold everything...
Guys, PIC is cheap. Go get it before it's too late!
That dog was paid off by Putin with trump steaks.
THAT SON OF A BITCH **ELON** IS GONNA DO IT AGAIN. THIS TIME TO MY ACCOUNT.

I'm thankful for this severely retarded market and the degenerates that perpetuate it.
By the SQ dip, guaranteed 5 bagger on weeklies
I have an interview for a management position today. Are there any foods offlimits? Kinda neede it after todays losses.
Higher highs, lower lows!!!
UMC Dec 18th 7.5 calls for .45 
Man if you bought all the PUTs I've ever bought only incrementing the expiry by one day you'd be one rich motherfucker.
We getting that nice v
I may be dumb but selling Friday after a pretty green week, assuming there will be red this week and being right may be my gayest win yet!
And my retard ass thought buying the first crsr dip was clever
Sold about a quarter of my PLTR holdings at 15.7 but put that money back into GME and A:P:X:T so I can't be too mad I guess.
Green green come on
Think Im gonna chill a bit and see wtf happens
I know some of yall bought those PLTR 40C weeklies on Friday. Show your 70% losses
Oh cmon, we can panic sell harder than that.
RMG is the EV stock to own. If the SPAC acquisition is approved (vote occurs December 2nd), RMG will acquire Romeo Power. Romeo was founded by former Tesla, SpaceX, Amazon, Samsung people.  They're anticipating EBITA profitability in 2023 and a billion dollar run rate by 2024. Post SPAC, there will be appx 125,000,000 shares outstanding, valuing the company based on today's price at $2.13 billion.  


Here's a snippet from the company's prospectus about one of their Lithium ION batteries.  


 

*Prasini Module*

As our standard automotive building block suitable for battery powered and plug-in hybrid vehicles, Prasini is the perfect module for trucks and buses. Prasini modules have active cooling, high stability and superior thermal management, and can be configured into eight unique different voltages. Our scalable recipe results in a faster time to market for our customers with off-the-shelf modules. The module functions as the ultimate drop-in solution; structure and cooling are seamlessly integrated into one package.

With a 10kWh capacity, 215 Wh/kg energy density, and a 2-hour charge time, Prasini has the highest energy density, longest range and fastest charging time on the market, even surpassing the Tesla Model 3 in energy density at the module and pack level. Prasini has a 21700 cell format in a modular design with high packaging efficiency, high power capability, and an integrated high cooling structure. Additionally, the Prasini modules are single-cell fault-tolerant by design, meaning that the risk of a catastrophic thermal incident is greatly mitigated. Prasini modules also meet SAE J2380 and J2464 vibration and shock requirements.
Fuck it, bought 30k worth of NIO 1/21/23 60 Calls on that dip. Let it priiiiinnnt

**BTFD**
Time for sideline cash to get in the game!
Safe to jump back in on TSLA ?
Anybody sick of watching SHOP ping pong between 1000 and 1100 endlessly for months? Jesus.
Why is everything going back up like that? Some news come out or something?
Reeeeeee
#Tesla T shape recovery

About to mirror future from last night. Green by close

Wall Street was done but guess what they back baby

What a nice cyber Monday deal on so many of my favorites :)
Dont paper hand!!!

Anyone remember when nkla fell like 20 percent in a few minutes and then shot back up after it's merger?
That was the correction. Now $50 by end of December....
NIO back from the dead...true journeyman.  Hope you bought the dip.  Lets hope this sustains.

APHA $9c... Huge buying this morning and pussy sell off
I would start writing RKT calls hoping to get assigned and be free of these bags, but the last time I did that I nearly missed out on huge gains. Never bet against meme stocks.
Is AMZN 3200c 12/4 a good play?
How is this market not rigged? *Wall Street sell off accelerates* then miraculously jerome wakes up and reverses this shit back to the moon haha
RKT about to breakout girls. 69% institutionally owned, we call that a pivot point
 *Fed's Barkin (2021 voter) says current level of bond purchases is providing pretty strong stimulus; duration extension is an option if the Fed decides more stimulus is needed*
God damn GME IV at 250%. Is that pricing in the squeeze? Or earnings? Both?
Took some Ls and bounced out. Diamond hands was the play so I Re-entered and its turning around. What the fuck have I become.
You have a big agina if you sold
Conspiracy theory, early morning drop is controlled dump with induced bounce so us retards lap it up
Retard here- what happens to my WORK calls after the buyout on Tuesday?
The RSI on some of this shit is still pretty low
Anyone else in on UMC or just me?
For those that have made big money in stocks, how has your life changed?

Did you keep yoloing?
Cash out and do more conservative plays ( boomer stocks, theta gang)
Quit your job? 
Start living more extravagantly!
TSLA PLTR and SPY.

Let's go gents
Wheres that one guy that bought 10k in spy calls ending today last Friday?
So what happens with this House bill regarding Chinese stocks. Should I sell my BABA shares? Already sold my calls.
Whew lad
We need to hold that 27 line
Thank you for the opportunity to buy more, but you can stop dipping now.

Back from the depths of Hell!!!
Those with Clean Energy calls are seeing Green RN

Damn you pilotair
Those cyber Monday deals were the truth - hope everyone got their favorite tickers on discount

Lets pump this bitch
Loading up on Nio on the dips. NIO day in Jan 2021 is gonna be huge
[Just bought myself these headphones. Hoping my calls on PLAY and CCL will cover the price](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-wh-xb900n-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-gray/6347799.p?skuId=6347799)
What other degenerate shit are you all into?
Vaccine or not ZM gonna beat
Last chance for puts before the end of this bounce
Bulls r fukt?  Oh well just hold and wait for the rest of the week.
NKLA down 25%, weekly 25p only up 130%
How we feel about RIOT? Bootycoin near ATH, are there are other tickets with exposure to that market?
Why does everyone on Billions have an IQ of 180?
SoftBank we retards could really use a Christmas pump, weve been good degenerates I swear.
WHO IS BUYING NKLA FUCK

WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE
Attempted v-shape seems to be failing
Whats better then tards not making money calling PLTR gang bots?
BTFD on PLTR srsly youll thank me later its gonna moon shot once we pass this market
AAPL going against the graintoday, in a positive fashion. Keep it up sir.
Gobbled up some SQ calls there too
I've got 2 29c 12/4 on PLTR, considering dumping them now Soni can get something back...
Glad I sold everything so I can buy these dips
Cvna will just not die
Thus Spake CockThrustra...

"And verily ye shall know the True Retard for the True Retard buys a dip of SOLO".
dont let them shake you
An actual fukin V. GTFO Farcical 
Combo SNAP + PLTR dips got me some pee in my boots but I like the direction of recovery so far 
Not to be that guy but since this is my bi-weekly 401k auto buy day red day isn't the worst thing in the world.  This baby is going negative karma.
Who are these retards playing casino slots? Fucking retarded. Just play stock options instead
Can bigger firms or funds see stop loss orders? I would think with a meme stock like pltr there's probably tight stop losses so if someone knew what they were at they could just unleash a short attack intraday and hit all of them and cover real quick
$ROKU, I may not meme about you (and this sub wont until youre $350 and its too late) but you da real MVP. $70 to $280 just on being one patient and evil motherfucker, making companies like Comcast bend the knee one at a time.
This market is a (real) traders dream.
Come on $tsla is so ducking close
someone tell me what to buy
One stimulus to go please
Days like today, Im just going to step back and not trade. IV too high to buy the dip and 1 red day will not get me to close my longer dated positions.
Guh
My only regret is not buying more NKLA lottos.

Gotta tell myself that it just as easily could have randomly pumped to 40.
What are the chances of GME absolutely tanking after Q3 earnings?
I fking belive in Alex Karp!!
To the fking moon 
Fk that paper hands kids
Winners bought the dip 
Wow next leg down on $spy 

Fake bounce fuck I gotta get out of Tesla

Tastyworks app isnt even fucking working

HYLN is still being beaten to hell
Anyone else doing Netflix calls? Looks like a good dip currently
I don't know how I survived that TSLA dip, only had highly leveraged calls
CRSR COMING BACK TO MOON, HARD.
Damn. NIO went to $48. I woulda bought that
Question: do gay bears like it or not like it when they get fucked by PLTR?
BUY CRSR
Orange men like pumps

***UK PM Johnson says he hopes Pfizer (PFE)/BioNTech (BNTX) and AstraZeneca (AZN LN)/Oxford vaccines will be approved by regulators before Christmas***
Didnt even realize until today that the fucking Property Brothers are also a music group.

And people say America isnt the land of endless opportunities. That is if you have money of course.
Whats TSLA ending today at?
I liked XPEV better at 40
Jmia :)
ACB 3/19/21 $12c for the win
Short NIO lock up period for last stock offering finishes end of day tommorow might see a sell off
Do I want to buy Riot monthlies?
CRSR on it's 2nd run up?
If I bought a call that expires on 12/11 for 50C. The price is at 45. Lets say the stock goes 45 -> 42 -> 48 by 12/4.

Option Buyer 1. Bought at the original 45 mark held through the drop and still holds it on 12/4

Option Buyer 2. Bought the option at 45, but this was after the 42, so he did not experience the dip.

&#x200B;

Is option buyers 2 option call worth more despite them being bought at the same price?

Is there something happening to the greeks if you hold through a dip to lessen its value?
Down trend and over bought on 5 min in holding puts
If BABA gets delisted, what happens to my contracts ?
TSLA 577 holding strong
This may be the allusive bulls r fuck day

So is tomorrow conceivably the day NKLA crashes below $10? I assume whether Trevor sells some or all his shares will come in to play?......
is testler about to go on a screamer?
DIP is my spirit animal
NVAX 15% today
91% of $CRSR's stock is owned by institutions. 

$CRSR stock has fallen by 21% in the past week.

Only 9% of shares are owned by retail, and the stock tanks 21%, and volume is normal, then who sold the shares to make the stock tank at or around the same time?

92 million shares outstanding, 

~4.5% of those are traded daily. (~4million average volume)

Institutions own 83,720,000 shares

Retail owns 8,280,000 shares

Anyone else have spidey senses going off on $CRSR?
FCEl taking off from this dip
AMD low resistance at $90 
I imagine gay bears are those fat guys with colored hair who participate in LARPING.
Wtf lol AMD
Is this the time to buy into NET long term? I feel like it havent dipped for a long time, and even this dip is quite small
Kind of a brutal day but NVAX looks exceptional
MY GIRL LISA DID IT! 90 in the REAR VIEW. Get your calls now for 100

Su Bae has been ignored for way too long
Man I sold my pltr contracts I picked up on the Friday dip for a profit on the morning bump feeling good. Bought that NIO dip and its heading back up to mars and feeling like a baller today. Real bulls rise up
Holy shit CRSR is vertical
Massive put buying on T (12/31 27p), IV is only 22%, this could be a 10-bagger

Read this with the 90s movie trailers voice:
In a world filled with autistic traders
And video gaming addicts (kids and grownups alike)
And pandemic that cripples economies and forces a stay home order
And a president who does give a shit about anything but a second term and stock market @30k
And a secretive in-q-tel cia born and raised spy tool which never made a profit and triples in value in a month or two
A brick and mortar fuck the world gaming company said hold my beer i am gonna break all rules....
GME
Now playing in an app near you

Lmao covid made me do it
Market wants stimmy news! Thats whats gonna send us to 370

When is oil gonna spike. Erx fd's pay off somehow this week with any news?
FCEL is printing
Are we ever going to see an AYRO recovery?
I think we see a big move EOD and end either flat/green or -2%. 

Why? Because I hate when the numbers move slow.
[deleted]
I should just keep averaging down on TSLA that way I'll always be green even if the rest of my portfolio has a red day.
Su Babe coming through for us
IPOB 
Trying to be a bull, but that insane tech drop almost seems like the canary in the coal mine.

$AAPL becoming the next meme stock again? 2% up while rest of market is thrashed today, everybody buying iphones cuz bOxy dESigN, pandemic and working from home still a thing, people purchasing usless shiny shit to suppress their lonelyness, upcoming pro laptops and computers with super efficient M1 chip and infinite battery life, new subscription services to throw your money at, Upcoming january Q1 results which for the first time will include iphone launch earnings that were delayed from q4 that beat down the stockprice last months...
PLTR getting rejected every single time.. not a good setup.. RIP my calls
What a great day. Sell at open on TSLA; ride back from 562 for a lil more gains. Now out and not touching that dynamo for a while. Have at it, boys.
Put a lot of dollars into F uuuu se today. Maybe it'll pop someday

What's the bull case for AAPL? It's been trading in the $120-$110 range for months now
Just waiting for Mark Cuban magic on IAQ
Appn calls?
So... is the NKLA bull case just that its potentially the second coming of Tesla and WGAF about profits or product? I hate this company so much
AMD 100 eoy
Interesting how Bloomberg and Washington Post etc. All release these negative articles about BABA on Sunday all at the same time.
Today was a huge shakeout operation.. gg MM's

So what the fuck is going on with the plant?
AMD MOOOOONING
MRNA puts anyone?
MP gonna fill the opening gap
Has anyone heard of Recon Africa? They have a giant plot of land in the Kavango basin in Namibia for oil exploration. Supposedly the plot of land is the size of the eagle ford shale patch in texas and that one company has rights to it all. Come December, we should see the results from their preliminary exploratory digging.

Im definitely retarded but im curious as just how retarded i am

Neat that the dollar looks to be holding support here.  If this thing pops just a little bit, dollar bears are in trouble. I have hundreds of UUP calls that are way in the red, but I'm doubling down here at what I think is the bottom. This could be a good but risky trade if you want a cheap play

Feeling like PLTR and GME both are gonna take a breather this week. Bought a few puts but don't plan on holding for long at all.
Is console hype tanking CRSR? If so. I wouldn't be worried at all once the hype passes by.
Had APHA calls loaded up at .13, RH didn't execute. Instead had to buy in at .26. Sitting at .18. F my life.
Buying puts on TSLA when it got rejected at almost $600 was easy money
AMD meme stock again , yay !
Im not playing ZM but excited to see what it does
Robinhood only executed 2/5 of my AMD 90c earlier thanks a lot. Oh well more GME shares.
ZM is pretty quiet, everyone staying away from earnings tonight?
MSTR for weekly play. Going to continue to moon as forbidden internet money hits ATH and everyones talking about it. Citron gave it a 500 dollar price target.
If you literally bought that AMD dip your weekly calls are a 3 bagger wow

I'm telling you guys here first, buy ZUO before earnings!! They are expected to have less revenue than they did last quarter, even though more businesses are starting to resume full operations and subscription businesses are on the rise !!!

A bat can bleed up quicker than SPY.
Hold ZM?
I think Nikola, with post-Trevor Milton leadership, is hesitant to sign a Badger deal. Theyre fully focused on fuel stations (primary business case), semi trucks (secondary), and powersports (tertiary...although I could see these falling off the base plan as well). A hydrogen fuel station partner will be important for sure, but not a Badger. This MOU with GM also opens up the option for Nikola to procure fuel cells without limitations as the original deal would have limited them to using GMs Hydrotec worldwide with the exception to Europe, which would have been Boschs fuel cells...thus allowing the company to better negotiate fuel cell costs.
Theres the SDC squeeeeeeze
dip to 360.50 before closing at 362

Getting banned from day trading has low key been the biggest blessing. Any others stop excessively losing $ as well when this happened?!
Get your shit together TSLA

So last wednesday I sold 12/18 30c PSTH for 0.5. And of course its starting to take off on no real news (That SA article was trash). Do I diamond hand and hope for a few weeks of theta or just buy back? I figured it wouldn't take off until January.
If NET can go to green aswell, then today would be perfect
why APHA? why? looks hyped already
SPY closing green
You know, I never appreciated MMs until now. You leave it up to retail traders and the market goes to infinity and a drop gets bought up as an opportunity as if every company is worth several trillion. Weve entered Pavlovian territory where every time a stock drops, its expected to go back up like a good little boy. 

This will eventually fuck all of the balls deep dip buyers expecting the same ole same thats been taught to them. 

This isnt healthy and will have costly consequences

AMD is at 92 now and I sold all my 12/18 85c at 87 because I was up 120%.

Honestly, missing big gains because you sold early is worse than losing

Is AMD another bull trap? I am holding dec. 18 $100 calls rn

$CHWY, quietly chugging along.
GME is slowly bleeding my portfolio. Already down 30% on these 12/18s
Got 1 year leap on XPENG...this stocks is awfully undervalued and will take off soon. They started importing their SUV and sedan to Europe, especially Norway.  Americans are sleepy on this giant. I think it will be bigger than NIO one day!!
Anybody know when the cannabis vote is?
a p x tea? or u hate money
If you havent noticed NIO and Xpeng on the sale of the month then I highly suggest you invest. At least buy calls or something this shit is such low hanging fruit right now its insane honestly

363 retest is imminent. 

That should be rejected forcefully and close near lows.

Tomorrow could be -2%.
Last time I played ZM earnings my 470 call went from $350 to over $10K overnight lol... unfortunately premiums are slightly higher this time around, but this could still be a lotto...might as well throw your hat in the ring. I think earnings could be a lot better than analysts are predicting
SAMA the new meme SPAC?
NKLA put holders, you guys havin' your day?
The apple calls I was going to buy are up more than the gme ones I did buy. Got way to greedy, gotta learn to take profits when a stock is up fucking 20%
In about 4 pltr positions tempted to sell one to put some money on tsla
what going back to tech? 

TECH AND WEED
Today's hidden hero for me were AAPL $140Cs bought this morning.  No news on AAPL = get in before hype train starts rolling again as always.  DD:  I bought i12 2 weeks ago after not upgrading since 8.  Showed co-worker, he bought i12 next day after not upgrading since 6.  Let's go!
PTON LETS GOO
RH screwed me this morning. Had an order for APHA calls at .13 premarket. Noticed after an hour it didn't go through, so had to buy at .26.

It's now sitting at .21, so I've lost money instead of being up. I might be the only person losing money on APHA today.  Grrrr.
Can someone explain why MRNA sees so much growth while PFE does not? Seems like theyre both on track with their vaccines and PFE is the more established pharma company

The PTON dip today was legendary

If you believe in Shit coin going to $300k next year, tell me how getting into RIOT LEAPS doesn't just make all the sense?
If you think spy will tank before EOD youre wrong. After hours will be strong once people see were safe

I have 5 figures on GME calls, so no im not bearish. but GME has followed the same pattern for the last 6 months. 

Heres the GME CYCLE

Shorts cover > Parabolic > More shorts are bought > Elevator down back to the major support levels > Consolidation > Pop > Elevator Down > Consolidation > Shorts Cover > Parabolic.

APHA just won a contract to supply edibles for Bidens dementia treatment. BULLISH.
Dudes stop asking if its too late to get in GME. Just look at GMEs market cap and compare it with the other meme stocks around here. A low 1B market cap has way more meme potential than PLTR

Honestly think TSLS ends day over 600.
Buy the PLTR dip
GME to the moon!
So I had a $40 0DTE PLTR 28p last week. I dont understand what ETrade did with it. They executed at $28.28, which I understand means they should have forced the contract holder to allow me to sell 100 shares. I would lose money because the put was OTM.

What actually happened appears to be that they borrowed 100 shares against MY account and sold them for $2800. I was in debt for 100 shares and got a Hard-to-Borrow notification saying they would charge me interest. 

Funny thing is, PLTR tanked over the weekend and I ended up buying 100 shares today for $2650, so I... made $150 on a $40, 0DTE, OTM put thanks to some creative interpretation by my broker of how puts work??

I dont understand the logic behind any of that. It LOOKS like some kind of psychic galaxy brain play by ETrade to turn my trade around, but it could only have made sense if they knew PLTR was going to eat shit over the weekend, because if it had mooned Id be majorly fucked.

Is this just something brokers do sometimes to save their poor stupid retail investors from themselves?
For those with weekly PLTR ITM, just exit your positions now and take what tendies you can. Otherwise you're in for an aneurysm watching it bounce off of 27.20 all day and theta gang gnawing your position to pieces. Theres other plays out there but PLTR is out of steam for a week or 2

Super rudimentary tax question that I couldnt easily find the answer to:

If anyone is feeling anxious, I think now is a decent time to average into positions you are interested in. No, I don't think this is the next leg down.

If a position becomes too large (which is a *good* problem to have), they will sell a bit to trim their risk.

I personally opened up another PLTR diagonal spread, 15c 5/21 -35c 12/18. Going to close my RKT positions soon for a gain after any type of bigly green day and put more into PLTR if it continues dipping.
So many overvalued stocks were gonna look back a few months from now and say wtf...
Fucking MRNA. Keeps just going up. They keep dropping news on days they should readjust down. I just want to buy realistic options. My stock is doing great, but that's boring.
the SEC def coming for you GameStop idiots. Im staying the fuck away lmao
God I really hope the bears bought puts on NIO and Xpeng today I really want them all wiped out please god let them be greedy and die this week

you guys are sleeping on $CHWY. about to sneak into $80 without anyone paying attention
NKLA is 12$ tomorrow right?
U.S. FDA, IN LETTER DATED NOV. 25, SAYS AUTHORIZING EMERGENCY USE OF ROCHE DIAGNOSTICS' ELECSYS ANTI-SARS-COV-2 S -REUTERS
The fact that people are still paper hands on NIO right now after today is honestly astounding. How can anyone be that dumb to let go of a golden ticket. Jesus this is comical I cannot wait to watch paper hands Wendys workers FOMO on NIO day lmao this is amazing
Damn, is GME really gonna cuck us like this?
You guys betting on hawks or eagles in bird game tonight?
jesus GME jumped off a cliff EOD... now pumps ah?
Hope you enjoyed that bears. No red days in December.

"So you're going by "Andrew Left" now nerd? Haha whats up douche bag, it's Tanner from Highschool. Remember me? Me and the guys used to give you a hard time in school. Sorry you were just an easy target lol. I can see not much has changed. Remember Sarah the girl you had a crush on? Yeah we're married now. I make over 500k a year and i am loaded on PLTR calls. I guess some things never change huh loser? Nice catching up lol. Pathetic.."
ALL UNITS THIS NET. BE ADVISED WE ARE ROTATING OUT OF PLTR AND CRSR, AND INTO GME.
Everyone transition from PLTR to GME
PLTR call holders in Palan-tears right now

(I'm sorry for your loss)
So is PLTR out of memefuel?
PLTR broke 27.50, this thing about to topple like a fat bitch down a mountain 
I felt a great disturbance in the IV, as if millions of PLTR bag holders suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.
GME is new meme. Sell PLTR, buy GME
People who bought PLTR at $34 
Imagine having a $100k salary work from home job and moving to West Virginia, where an apartment only costs $500/month.
Y'all idiots losing money on a dead company in GameStop buy APHA if you want money
Pltr 29 eod
PLTR gonna close green.

&#x200B;

If not ill "accidently" slip it in my GF's ass mid thrust. And then I won't stop.
When is this GME squeeze suppose to happen? Or did you guys trick me yet again..
You know, I never appreciated MMs until now. You leave it up to retail traders and the market goes to infinity and a drop gets bought up as an opportunity as if every company is worth several trillion. Weve entered Pavlovian territory where every time a stock drops, its expected to go back up like a good little boy. 

This will eventually fuck all of the balls deep dip buyers expecting the same ole same thats been taught to them. 

This isnt healthy and will have costly consequences
no human is buying here.
Looks like GME is fucked
WHEN $PLTR AND $GME HIT 100 EOY I'LL EAT MY BOYFRIENDS DOG
Fuck PLTR lookin weak 
Made up my baby losses on PLTR 5x over with puts

Go head and downvote me
Feels so good to know that Palantdrill meme is finally over.
Stop messing around with GME and get into CRSR. CRSR reps will be in a Credit Suisse webcast later and with post-Black Friday / Cyber Monday deals this thing is easily going to moon by Q4 earnings.

Seriously undervalued at current price. And these products are top of the line.
PLTR
Holy shit my gfs bfs talking about how were in a simulation lol should I invest in Tesla now? Maybe Elon was on to something
[deleted]
There's so many better choices than GME hopefully y'all still go to the moon though

***HORY SHIT ME NO RIIKEY***
PLTR is about to drop so fucking hard. This is a pump and dump yall, this is not a recovery.
These bitches are telling you to buy PLTR but in reality, they are simply trying to pump up the stock so they can get out themselves
Im a bull but everyone knows this is a dead cat bouncing.

Everyone knows

Right???
Alright, that's it. I'm getting some PLTR puts.

Look at the chart, what they do and who is involved.

I'll say no more.
If you are wondering why BABA goes down:

Jack Ma criticized CCP, now they are blocking up his new IPO and probably BABA also will get hurt.

US sanctions can also reach BABA as one of the most prominent Chinese companies.


BABA is on both governments radar and its an easy target. This shit will crash this week
I bought 10K of NKLA on Wednesday. I haven't checked the market yet. How are my gains? Legendary?

WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK
Let me explain to you retards why QS should be taken very seriously and not just a other EV start up. QS is developing solid state batteries and have a working prototype (announcement I believe this week). Solid state batteries allow for MUCH faster charging vs liquid batteries currently. A Tesla can take 8-10 hours to charge. QS is claiming its batteries can full charge in under an hour. They are so confident in this that VW is heavily investing in them for their future EV. VW is going all out in designing a EV by opening their coffers to the sum of **$177 BILLION DOLLARS** with QS being a lynch pin of the design. Bill Motherfucking Gates is also heavily investing in QS as the future of EV. JB Straubel is a co-founder, who was also a cofounder of TSLA. Straubel knows his shit, as he was heavily involved in TSLA R&D.

QS $60 by EOY
PLTR no longer best friend. GME best friend now
CMON LETS GOOOOO
All I see is green green green no matter what - every time I hit F5 all I see is fucking HOT.. SPY 370 close, PLTR 40+, GME $22+ we run this fucking game

 $140 by Christmas..there I said it
I'm tired of making money
wait so the tsla run up was BEFORE SPY buys some shares?
I think these GME shorts are pretty stubborn. Every time a short seller gives up another fills it's place. This will probably keep going until this stock does actually hit a point where it's overvalued, at which point it will dump. I don't think there will be a full short squeeze though because these shorters are really stubborn and really believe this stock is gonna correct at some point. Don't bank on a short squeeze. It won't happen unless theres a good catalyst. If they can smash earnings on 12/8 there would be one, but I don't think it's gonna happen on a random Monday like today.

I hope this comment doesn't age well as I am balls deep in GME calls but let's see what happens in the next 2 hours.
THC  stay fucking strong man. Look at the 30 minute chart, They shook out heads just like this last week at 11. dont get duped and bamboozled!

Greedy clowns buying EV calls 
That GME call I bought at open was a terrible idea
Janet Yellen should be the new face of the 20 dollar bill.
AAPL bulls sure are talking a lot for a ticker that you'd still be down on had you bought 11/16, anytime 10/12 - 10/15, or any point 8/21 - 9/4
Whats a good limit order for this GME squeeze babeh
If spy doesn't go green by end of day, im never going to have enough money to know what boobs feels like

Boys I have a retarded question , thinking of reinvesting my tendies back into pltr.

I just checked the order book and see a nice green wall?

That means theres more buying or more selling?

Red means sell and green means buy AMirite?

Is that good sentiment, thanks  
Only have enough for one. Which should I get into today? TSLA, ZM, NIO, PLTR, or GME?
The sound of 1.6m 'Guh' noises will be heard this side of the Atlantic by the end of today!
Would getting into pltr right now be considered fomo?
If TSLA dips to 590 Im all in.
Does RH fill stock buys outside of market hours?
Sell some PLTR to buy some GME for diversification?

Alright the old meme stocks are dead, what we memeing on going forward so I can get in early?
Not sure I trust GME to not dip today. Might get in then but I cant justify buying on an already up 15%+ day
Catch the PLTR knife boys
GME a bit late; stock isn't very stable

What's the catalyst for this selloff?
PLTR dip free money.

For people that are regretting going into PLTR heres a good ticker to have eyes on rn.

Sold PLTR to buy CRSR.. lets see if Im dumb or retarded
Unpopular opinion: The *senate* not passing the MORE act is priced in. The writing is on the wall, legal marijuana on a federal level is coming.
Wtf, they never announce anything before TSLA decisions but now they announce something before it happens? If it fails to get into S&P this shit is rigged.
I like CRSR because its a well established company that just went public and there's zero drama, zero politics, and zero dependency on the new president's policies. 

they just make good products yo. they should be rewarded as such.
Are we buying POOTS?
Weed stocks fade so fast.
Pltr gonna dead cat bounce. 12/04 31c ez moneys

I had 2 MRNA 100C 12/18 which I sold last week when MRNA  broke 100,the same calls would be worth 10K now :( ,I can't get over this
Imagine not being balls deep in AAPL calls
BABA is falling because they announced that they wont go ahead with ANT IPO in 2021 either. Its not because of the house vote on Chinese companies listed in US exchanges. Even if they pass that dumb legislation, the companies have 3 years to comply
Up over 90% on Apple calls i bought today too bad i didnt go all in
All in on APHA, got a good feeling for this week.
Getting in TSLA now will be the definition of FD. One way or another its going to jump AH.
"after further consideration, we will not be letting tsla in the sp500" 

You can only dream about reading this headline following the index meeting later 
Sour hour
So whats up with tesla. Buy? Hold? Sell?
GME is jokes  .. 
Market is going down because people ate cashing out to buy Christmas presents
AAPL doesn't even look good on the 30 day - looks even worse on the 3 mo. Don't understand why y'all were bullish cuz you tipped 120 for the 69th time since the ATH
GME monthly candle gonna be large. But know where close to the size of December candle.

Stonks are being wacky today, not in my favour too.

I disapprove, STOP THE COUNT.

I won on PLTR when it was at 33 so I should be able to sell at that price.

Calling my lawyers!
Dead cat bounce 
Ah yes, an intelligence analysis company that was funded by CIA startup money and continually picks up new fed contracts isnt going to be a top tier stock. Theres definitely not a massive glut of raw data being produced by digital surveillance that desperately needs catalogued and input into databases. Ok guys.
Switch to pltr puts you fucking idiots this is your last chance god gave you retards a second chance to get out take it!

Silly bitches thought PLTR was ded

Mods removing comments in the weekend shitpost thread, but letting these penny pumpers run rampant. 

Fuck your homo.
Got $640 left in buying power, any potential 10 baggers?
Hoping this is the correct place to ask this, not sure if there is weekly post regarding questions, anyways.

I've been trading for quite a while but am looking to place my first options trade, I've researched but I can't find the answer to this question/example.

For simplicity let's say I have $1,000 I want to purchase a call option for a $20 stock that costs me $500, next week it goes to $25 and I want to exercise the right to purchase the option, do I need the additional $20,000 in my account to actually purchase them if my plan is to immediately sell them for a profit? or when I exercise the purchase does the share buying/selling happen behind the scenes and I just have the profits in my account?

Thanks
Sell all the stocks 
The big one is coming
Everyone here is so fucking sure the GME short squeeze is gonna make it moon...

Reminds me a lot of the QuAD WitCHinG earlier this year. This shit is going nowhere lol

Youre nuts if youre not buying this Palantir dip
Can all the PLTR bagholders move to /r/investing now and let the smart folks talk
I hope that smooth brain that sold PLTR $28 puts got assigned.
PLTR call holders will, for the rest of their lives, blame Citron for bankrupting them. Even though every single hyper-inflated WSB fomo stock is taking a shit today.


I'm not saying Citron helped, but if you think they are the sole cause of this downturn, just because they tweeted that it's a "casino," u just straight up wrong.


Whether or not PLTR deserves to go up longterm, you can't go in on a stock that blasted 200% in a month from a massive gamma squeeze and expect to not get rekt.
Get on A P X T you retards. We are still boarding.
The WSB front page is filled with posts where people lost like $30k on PLTR today, $30k yesterday, and all the comments are like "I'm still holding not scared."


I always wondered how people managed to lose so much money on downturns, and this is why. Absolute greed and refusal to sell, ever.


Oh well, the upcoming loss porn gonna be juicay
If u aint all in AAPL, u aint black.
Opinion:
TSLA is overpriced piece of shit that is shit in real life but godly on paper.
- that company for many years made no profits until recently, made little profit, definitely not justifying market cap of half a T
- Elon Musk is a piece of shit celebrity wanna be, who stole Tesla from its original founder and kicked him out and is taking credit for everything the original founder and the current employees are doing, i mean seriously what is elon musks contribution to tesla? $30 millions and a bunch of scandalous tweets? Heck the taking back tesla price @$420 cost tesla $20 mill, that is almost as much as his original investment
- the embarrassing failed attempt to rescue the kids from the cave, and the ensuing insults and name callings, and the failed delivery of ventilators, while not directly linked to tsla performance, it speaks volumes of piece of shitness of elon musk
- tesla products are quality deficient and in my opinion are overvalued
- lack of meeting delivery promised quotas 
- elon musks nazi management and leadership methods and the horror stories of the employees who dare question or whistle blow
- his threats to move the factories to another state if California wont let him resume production and making a big stink about it on twitter, defeating state orders, exposing employees to covid, and firing employees who chose to stay home and follow state orders, all that to ensure he gets his contractual bonus of roughly $700 million if he keeps the companies valuation above $100b for six straight months. What an asshole!!! The $100billion he made within a year wasnt enough?!!!!
- bonus: tesla battery day was a complete shit show, it was like a highschool science project lol
- did i make money from tesla? Sure i did, but it was more like having sex with a fat woman just to get out of jail lmao - i still think tesla is way overpriced and i think the more established car makers were too stupid to go in bed with the oil companies back in the days, yes GM i am talking about you primarily (EV1 anyone?), and the other car makers who were either too stupid or too vested to not flood the market with EVs.
- so why is tesla printing? Duh hype and nature of the herd, follow the alpha male and shut up
- reckoning day is imminent 

P.s: i know elons dick rider will knock me for this, but like religion, i say if you put sacredness aside, you will start seeing things more clearly.

Anyone going in on Spartan Acquisition 2?  These are the folks that brought FSR public.
Hope microcars doesnt fuck me. Hoping for a triple bagger
Glad I bought that MRNA 145 12/04 last friday! Sell at open or let it ride?
Got some tree from a trulieve dispensary around me and its pretty great. Mj play but no options.
[deleted]
yall think Baba is gonna fall more or has it already had time to settle pre-market?
Green by open Inc.
Will PFE tank or moon following this MRNA news?
Kinda wish NKLA would stay above 23 this week, since I sold some 23P

Its to cover a short position so I won't own any NKLA either way, but I'd rather remain short on them...
anyone use finviz elite? worth the cost?
Im loving this setup
So is Biden's ankle just a sprain, is that why markets are up?
QS has got to pop soon right??
Copper is at all time highs. Copper gang 
Do I sell TSLA 565c 12/4 at open? Was down 10% last Friday dip
You know what they say. If you cant beat a resistance level gap up over it.
Yall keep sleeping on NNOX, Im telling you man this shit is the future
MRNA looking quite crispy
Thoughts on a surprise Cybertruck update on Cybermonday?
ZI looks like it would correct without the end of lockup, and looks like the end of lockup will flood the market with sellers. Planning to find a good time today to sell my PLTR calls and pick up some ZI 12/18 35p
Moderna floating away like a helium balloon.

Fuck MasterCard
PAMP
Fuck, anyone buying puts on NKLA at open or e didnt even have time too td
Time please take me out the ghetto this week!
Tesla leaving I need to hop in there too 
HYLN calling in their warrants. This is a risk with SPACs (many of which are issued with warrants). If the share price does well enough to trade above the warrant exercise price, the company has an incentive to call the warrants in, which raises cash for the company (positibe) but also dilutes the common stock shareholders (negative).
I hope the markets let me buy real coca cola instead of shoprite brand today.
Tesla went up 50% in 1 month that  is fucking crazy 
  Why did all this bad news about BABA drop after I buy calls on Friday. So fucked.
Too late to get into PSTH?
Ok maybe now its time to panic
Is there any reason I shouldnt sell everything for MRNA Montlhy FDs? Trend continues and they havent even gotten approval. Im thinking easily $200+ by eoy
I thought you fuckers were buying, not selling
GNW up 12% pre-market with confirmation that their in-progress acquisition is moving forward 12/31 for $5.43/share. Currently trading at $4.60. Should pop higher at market opening as funds try to lock in a 16% gain in 1 month.
Is QQQ going to break 300 or is this the top?
ok baba.
CNK you slug vax is coming

This market is so crazy that I wouldnt be surprised to see $NKLA go green by end of day.

All to dump the next day once the insiders can start selling 
CMPS is up 10% premarket, it's the next Thiel play and picking up steam.
Looks like BABA panic selling PM, likely to see it dump a bit after open but it should recover to ~270 or so by close hopefully.
$CGC is down slightly premarket when every other Cannabis stock is still exploding from last week. Easy tendies I think here. Federal vote on Weed sometime between this Wednesday and next Friday will give a boost
I honestly think buying NKLA weeklies at open isnt a stupid strategy. Shits gonna kangaroo
CMPS flying high
crm$ tanked fuck u

Bought some RAM and a bathrobe and Peter Thiel's book Zero to one for cyber monday. Scared to get in on GME right now or any of the memes, even though they are probably going to keep blowing. Thinking about a bigger position in airlines 6months out, or maybe some long DIA calls.

What are some good tickers for selling CSPs right now? Think I need to get back to theta gang for a bit.
Crsr really babysitting that 37 mark
Guys, I have a question. Do any of you fuck around with synthetic stocks? I have a plan and I want to know if its crazy enough to work. Im thinking about doing this in a RRSP so no margin. Here is the plan: step 1 is to sell a LEAP cash covered put that is slightly in the money on a boomer stock. These stocks tend to march upwards even if they dont go up by leaps and bounds. If im $1 in the money on a $25 stock it will probably make that in a year.

Step 2: buy multiple LEAP otm calls. the put should probably cover about 3 or 4 calls (based on current values). At the very least it should be 2 calls per 1 put.


Would this not have the same downside as buying stock (if it goes down it will be like I bought the stock) but double/triple/quadruple the upside? I guess I would miss out on dividends.


Anyone ever fuck with this sort of thing?
MSTR IV dip, get in now.
Where are my digital turbiners??

Ive been with Nikola since VTIQ days. I got 1 for 1 VTIQ to NKLA shares post merger. Note that the 5.7% is from the VTIQ common shares. The rest came from PIPE investors and pre-IPO Nikola investors such as Bosch, Hanwha, etc...those take up the ~94%.
Whoever keeps fucking around with LLY's 160C can stop. I'm not fucking letting them go.  

One of the few stocks that I've seen that much volatility in its price day in and day out for the past 2 weeks.

The Mar 19 $20/$35 call spread is selling for $3.35

Makes no sense to me, why would a longer dated option be less?

Also, PSTH is at $25.94; I'm getting a ITM call spread for $3.35, $20 is the strike, so $23.35;

I am basically getting upside free? nearly $3 dollars of Intrinsic value for free.

Seems like I'm missing something

I think the first priority should probably be barring data caps, but I'm sure a Dem led will be more in favor of rural broadband and not care. 

Nonetheless CMST, T, and VZ are probably more impacted.

I bought AAPL calls expiring December 4th and 30 minutes later they are worth more, but the price is still the same. What made them go up? IV? The price has actually dropped, but they are worth more?

Don't catch a falling knife indeed.  Lets see how low gold goes before I buy in again.  Totally against market timing with stonks due to missing out on dividends but with gold that isn't a problem.
ZM is too expensive and too unpredictable, so all of are unsure to play it or not. Get extreme gains, feel the FOMO, or just having no cash to play it.

About fucking time
You all sleeping on MDNA?

All the bleed out was on super low volume. My poor SPG.
Go ahead tsla, behave like that penny stock you truly are.
Snakes fucking algo suck my balls I only look at the 1 year chart when u take my money
PTON cured Rona and invented an electronic vehicle. and video games. and scored military contracts to combat cyber terrorism
Bee to EOW.
QQQ still pumping
My dow puts expiring Friday is fucked aren't they?
Saved by PPT EOD, screwed a little by RH lagging at the end couldn't get completely out but still have some time
I couldnt resist buying 20 CRON 9.5c 12/4 for .21 each 

420 giggity
wtf was that last minute NNOX dildo
Scooped up a number of calls at close. I'm ready to be hurt.
Made some tendies from AMD after quite a long time.
Is spy AH activity normally this violent?
Man wtf is CCL doing
Yoloed into 15.01.20 tesla 500p before close, for some reason i think they will print hard after 5:15
Nice little pump by spy eod
is yahoo reporting the wrong PSTH information or is it just me
Why tf is spy mooning lol
Wallstreet pumping for that monthly record
I bought 1 $AMZN 3500C 02/19/21 today. Hoping that plays out well before earnings. Although holding through earnings is tempting too... I'm sure their earnings will be stellar.
TSLA ruined orgsma
Wtf just happed to ARKG ah
When is zoom coming
Anyone who thinks its not going to gap back up after a day like this is...well...a   but those are going extinct

NKLA FD 24c at close. Good lotto scratcher for 88$.

That TSLA dip was brutal , what are your forecasts for tomorrow?
Get in Corsair gaming you nerds
Fucking Apple with that stupid drop at 3:45. My calls went from +20% to +3%. They'll start printing again tomorrow but it would have been nice to end the day with a slightly larger number
tsla tank tmrw
ok... this AH action... do we buy calls for wed lol?
Boqii good recovery
they better be announcing something amazing for PSTH
I dont know shit but that close seems pretty bullish for tomorrow
 \- Revenue: $777M vs $694M est - EPS: $0.99 vs $0.76 est
NASDAQ is GREEN

RECOVERY TIME LET'S GO!
Imagine panic selling a dollar AAPL drop and its already up 60 cents in after hours
Apple was early but calls on google, Amazon, Facebook too
Opinions on DMYD?
And Amd wipes me out yet again
Honestly I feel good about GME maybe I can pick up a couple more April 25Cs tomorrow if it trades flat and premiums come down a tad.
Why is zm dying
Well, today lived up to the hype lol
PLTR hype ded. Slow bleed to 20
Whoever made up the  __ goes brrrrr fuck u I dont like u.
PLTR definitely dead now
When did buying shares or "yoloing" into shares become part of this sub?

smh
And the gay bears who downvote every comment are back again
PLTR will be 60 EOY no rush to cash out 
PLTR reaper has arrived for all the new thanksgiving autists  thanks for playing boys, back to r/investing you go
What does Palantir do? Sell planets ?
Pltr sucks ass. Worst meme stock
I don't have significant bearish positions, but I'm thinking this vaccine pump is going to be super temporary. Next few days we're going to see news about hospitals being so overwhelmed they're having to ration care and historic levels of people out of work. Q4 profits at risk
Can someone explain to me why the steaming pile of shit GME is skyrocketing? Can console sales really save this thing?
Yuo guys rly thought PLTR was gonna moon today?? like seriously?

Get in GME before it rockets to mars.
Just paper handed out of PLTR. Cant take the stress of seeing everything else red, and knowing PLTR is on its way down. Ill be in later today.
Bye PLTR told you guys 20 mins ago you were too busy yanking it to ur 20% returns
PLTR is dead
Damn PLTR is dead
GUYS YOU REALIZE IF WE ALL JUST BOUGHT MORE PLTR WE WOULD ALL BE MAKING MONEU BCUZ THEN YHE STOCK GOES UP STOP SELLING BUY MORE
Haha you fucking PLTR cucks

Shit restaurant, shit stock, short it to the ground.


ZERO HOT WAITRESSES
Rotate from GME into APHA
Haha  people are still holding pltr
READ THIS POST AND WARNING::
I have a friend in the financial sector, his name is Bertrand. He is a tremendous financial investor and a very good friend of mine, he might even be Jewish, or Finnish, but who knows? He was been working a lot of overtime lately, and he is connected with the most tremendous and financially great minds on the big and booming Wall Street. He personally told me, because we are excellent friends, that the market is going to dip tremendously this first half of the week and suggested to buy the dip on Wednesday. Or maybe it was Thursday, who knows? I know only the best people in this sector, and they have tremendous knowledge and have great instincts and great connections. They will make our bank accounts great again.
got 40 contracts of PLTR puts 12/4 25 strike. Lets go
You guys buying gme calls deserve to lose money. They are a dying company and have been for years
anyone still holding PLTR RIP. Get ready for a new ass hole. I just sold at 29 and my butt is sweaty
Last time TESLA was at 600 back in Jan it climbed to the 800s in a week pre split. Not sure if that correlates with post split movement but still food for thought
Definitely bummed Im missing out on the PLTR and GME gains.. I am holding a few long PLUG calls and GM calls so at least I am making profit but not as much as some of you guys
Pltr fading away
Today feels like the day that r/wallstreetbets loses its credibility... and a ton of subscribers !
Dumping PLTR while I am still ahead. What is the next meme?
Pltr bulls had their chance to get out.
I expected more from apex

To everyone who was downvoting anyone saying something bad about PLTR let this be lesson. Our goal is to make tendys not stan a ticker. Yall deserve this
love to see PLTR dipping
Just pulled out of my PLTR stocks after -14% loss. Gonna take a break from investing for a while.
Downvote squad coming through. Downvoted wont bring your portfolio back lmao
LMAO tesla down 30%
Do you weekly otm call buyers now realize how fast tendies can disappear. You fools never learn :)
I hope all you fools who sold palantir for GameStop suffer. Truly one of the dumbest plays Ive ever seen
#TSLA bulls stand back and stand by! 
 
We break 580 and its off to the races
Nice bull trap
I'm feeling a strong EOD dump deep in my balls
What PLTR rumor?
ACB is the PLTR that

Dumping all these PLTR calls. Super gay flatline boomer stock
Really torn on whether to sell my GME shares
Hmm PLTR dipped under 27 that doesnt seem good

Im going to piss myself laughing when PLTR tanks and takes you tards with it
PLTR >GME fight me nerd
GME puts purchases. Sorry folks!
I am not feeling too good about my 12/11 Pltr call. I feel like this meme stock has had its run
Textbook green by open. red futures just mean smaller green at open. 

when will i ever learn. big losses this year. looking good for a few years of tax write offs!
PSTH to Pluto!
Makes you wonder if they need to fix something with the pre market. Shouldnt be so fake and gray
Moderna goes brrrrrr
Is trying to convince idiots who dont know any better to hop on your short squeeze the same as trying to arrange a pump and dump? 

Some of yall about to get burned big time trying to pump and dump.
Baba is dead
I have 3k to fuel the rocket, but currently have 2k tied up in Apple shares - rest spread between NIO PLTR GILD PTON UBER. Should I keep or sell AAPL? Seeing all this shit about NIO PTON GME and TSLA really making me want to up my money on those. Any replies appreciated.
I think gme is cursed
Surprise, surprise. TDs options chains down again. 
I wish I could block NKLA comments.. so bored hearing about them
So we're all pouring money into PSTH at open, right?
Safe play without day trading?
wtf NIO
Do I need to set an automatic sell for my GameStop shares at a certain price so I dont miss the squeeze? I actually need to work and cant focus on it during the day
My only bearish fear is that the outgoing administration will kneecap the market
Can we all agree this market is fucked up? SPY and PLTR should be ATH
oh my god PLTR is down
Is there any news for GameStop?? Whats to stop this reactionary short squeeze from falling dramatically
wrong way just means puts
[deleted]
**NEW ALL TIME HIGH FOR BITCHCOIN IMAGINE NOT HOLDING**
Buy the NKLA dip!
At this point CRSR might balance out..? People should jump on the sale BIGLY
Do people here not know basic things about stocks? If the entire market is going down, then you shouldnt worry/panic sell
Just averaged down and bought shares on PLTR, 35 EOW guaranteed
PSTH now, PLTR is dead.
I quit
getting ready to snag cheap calls on PLTR EOW
WSB banned safe as fuck SPACS but keeps money losing retard plays

Why is CRM down 8% on the week when they are acquiring slack?

&#x200B;

Am I missing something here?
Sell all your TSLA DEstonks and buy PLTR STONKS because were going where ELON CANT GO, to FUCKIN CENTER OF THE MILKY WAY BRAHHHH

Tuscan gang looking sinusoidal tf
Havent purchased something from GameStop since 2011 nor has anyone I know. PLTR is actually a company that has government support. GameStop is just lifted up by some guy that sells pet food. Why is GameStop such a good play nowadays? Help out a guy who is hesitant to buy 250 shares at the $17.50 price real quick
PLTR better go up or Im gonna have to step in(.)
Words of wisdom in regards to those who play options ^^^and ^^^especially ^^^PLTR ^^^callholders : know when to cut and run when you're bleeding
Good thing my autism misread all the ACB talk as AQB and I bought a bunch of calls before today. Just kidding, actually I bought them because of some DD someone posted on AQB over a month ago. It finally paid off.
Who else in RKT , only a matter of time before they start launching off again
Good thing I sold my AMD calls yesterday 
u'd think elong or bozos would just toss me a mil if i just asked?  i mean like, why not? pretty convincing argument tbh
Another big slide coming
WSB World Record Pump and Dump Award goes to GME: A half of ONE Trading Day!

Quite Impressive, don't know what could dethrone it.
AAPL $135 EOW looking more and more likely. 3% a day keeps the gay bears away

Everyone gonna dump APHA by next week like they dead PLTR. Taking names with no remorse. cant even hold a position for a fucking day, you clowns
GUHlantir
I took profits last week because December looking like a bear orgy
I have left pltr gang. It has been a wild ride and i thank you all. Good evening
THAT WAS FUN, BUT WERE NOT DONE YET 
PLTR has a strong daily resistance. Holding my puts 
GameStop is not going up seriously you people are betting on a dead company
Damn PLTR gang. At least on Friday you hit like 10% gains at one point, but running out of gas 30 minutes in?

DRILL TEAM 6 BABY
PLTR going to moon - retards yesterday

Edit: thank you for the gold kind stranger
Genuine question. Best toolkit for watching RTI (Real Time Information) on intruments like RSI, MACD, DMA etc... ?  


Built into a broker would be nice, but happy to consider other suggestions.
Alright boys PSTH, TME, RXT, APHA, FROG. Thank me later
Do I sell C IIC for T DAC short term?
Just picked up another 1k shares GME
Where's this vaccine pump?
PSTH premarket spreads must be ridiculous

Please help me restore my post, showing that Germany is buying GME pre-market, thanks.
dont unverstand why moderna moons higher than bntx? bntx got the better vaccine, produces way more doses  and will be applied  1 week earlier.  maybe cause us dumbasses think that pfizer made the vaccine (but they only manage the logistics)
Elong just stealthy upping TSLA each day. Its already up 45% since SPY inclusion news, yeah!
Wheres the weekly monday vaccine pump
Any CLF bulls here? How we feeling
Is tech not gonna be hit by the vaccine news?
Vaccine pump inbound
buzz buzz motherfuckers
Anyone playing/predictions for ZM earnings? Higher EV/rev than PLTR. 

Cant find much expectation divergence from their own guidance (685m, 73c/share) issued in August (which is within 10 and 20% respectively of Q2 actual). Easy expectations to beat but nonparabolic growth to sink retarded (boomer) valuation
NKLA 40c 12/11???
Is the wsb discord working for anyone else
Chinese EV Sector rotation to weedstocks
GME graph looks like an ekg graph wtf is going on lol
switchback oversold?
PSTH moving PM, no news visible...must mean insiders got the scoop.
So when did this entire Blank Check company phenomenon take over? And why?
Why do people gild this discussion?
Jimmy Dunne is such a piece of shit. Thank god for Andrew for grilling him on his support for David Purdue.
Short float on RKT over 25%.

A proper valuation for apex by my calculation is $105
Everyone get in on Mr. Epsteins company while you can. Apparently even mentioning it is taboo to wsb mods
Standing by my big tech shares, not chasing meme stocks.
how are NONE OF YOU TALKING ABOUT NGA
Bought PLTR and it's still the same price, so disappointed. APHA has been rising though! GET IN ON APHA NOW! It keeps going up.
for PSTH, why not just buy its warrants instead of shares? are they too expensive?
BABA no :(
People are dying and government cant stop with the anti-trust bullshit
If anyone is feeling uncertain, just remember the fundamental law of the land. **Stocks only go up!**
alexa play Tool Reflection
Positions today: long MSOS, GME, FAN, probably going to pick up some ITM 12/4 APHA call options at open (TD won't let me trade options)
I got $200 to trade with what do I buy at open?
Which boomer retards are still paying for hotel stocks... that shit is dead even with the vaccine next year
Where can i expect apex to go from here?
pltr lookin flattt
Too late to join Bee gang?
I used to love tsla but i hate it to the core now
Well.... OUCH Gme
RH FUCKING ANYONE ELSE?!?!
THE INFINITY SQUEEZE IS HAPPENINGGGGGG
NKLA puts printing real nice
That strange feeling when you hope some of your covered calls get exercised because you know that the pump is real and won't hold through the week....please hit and then tank again.

Options getting to that point where theyre just way too expensive, need a correction to reset prices. Same as it was late august.
Ive been trying to tell you fuckers about GME for sooooo long but noooooo its blockbuster, fuck you
DONT LET YOUR MEMES BE DREAMS JUST DO IT
Dec 11 35C PLTR bby

Cant believe I sold my GME Friday who knew WSB would pump that shit over the weekend
If you're tired of looking at PLTR charts all day, get AAPL calls. MS just upgraded price target to $191, and other brokerages upgraded it to a buy based on 5G demand for iPhone in US and China. January $125c are still a good price
Holy shit Im losing so much on TSLA
Blood bath
Citron daddy what happened to all ur money?
Hahaha TSLA gonna go red
Damn NIO dead you hate to see it

PLTR all over the fucking place
This happens at every open, i dont get why people are panicking
Magic coin fomo unreal
WTF, is IBKR down????
Why GME so high
Any thoughts on SOLO moving back upwards?
Copying my post from a few days ago since it is still true.

the next 10 bagger is a Business Intelligence software company called MSTR. And it has nothing to do about its software. MSTR used its whole cash reserve to invest in shit coin at 11k (now around 19k)
Wall Street doesn't want to buy straight up coins themselves, but they will invest in companies like MSTR for exposure.

You heard it here first. Check back in June next year. Already up huge the last week
These MMs performing some fuckery today, Im out. See you next week
Fuck Palantir. Im doing ITM RKT calls this week. IV is perfect with the baby dip
whats some good long term shares to buy? Im done with calls 
Why is everything red today?
This week may be a really good opportunity to buy back airlines and cruiselines
Can someone explain to me what a spac or blank check company is? I want to start one, seems like easy money right now.
Will I make it 4 consecutive days of going minus 150+ to a 100+ profit?...

Probably not but a man can dream
Its over
I'll push this one last time. MSTR. Their entire reserve is in digital currency. As long as fed ruins value of the dollar this stonk will rocket up. Once rates are increased, it may go down, but thats not until a long time.
If youre not buying the acb dip you must not like easy money
F in chat
PLTR is a rollercoaster this morning
PLTR ded
yall downvoted me for selling pltr at the top on friday lmao
Gandalf just put the cloak on PLTR.

Need a fool of a Took to bail you Bombadil's out now.
okay boys, what's our next play? I just closed some positions at 5k profit. need a YOLO
I was legit up 20k at open now red because Tesla cliff dived 3.5% lmao at me for not selling in time
today is bearish AF. did any of you retards actually buy calls on meme stocks at open?
Gme going the wrong way
Chinese EV taking heavy ass losses today. I'm guessing this has to do with general market downturn, as well as possible US audit rules for chinese companies.
SPY 12/4 $370c?
GMHI
Is Nikola a buy boys?
Bro fuck PLTR and whatever else gay stonks youre looking at please hype up ev stocks again Im down bad

Bought some VXX calls today. Anyone else do the same?
You thought you were getting to the moon. But the moon is always higher. The moon is the [pink dragon](https://media1.giphy.com/media/l0HlJgGs5qYntZ3Ne/giphy.gif).

The stock market is now just internet goons humping each other without knowing a thing, wow look at Palantir go down down down
TSLA gonna go back to 500 today so MMs can load up
Offset your losses. Buy weekly puts and try to stop the bleed

I made 65% on my puts and missed out on making 180% and now I want to $ROPE

Almost lost all my gains from the past month
PLTR on its way to zero LMFAO
Oh yes down 40% lets go PLTR 
umm, wtf this feels like the calm before the storm, im seeing all stocks heading downwards
yess. the only good thing abt seeing my RH go down today is that finally the PLTR yapping tards will shut up
race for the exit, end of year profit taking and tax loss.  Here comes a 10-15% correction before the end  of the year
Buy the PLTR dip you fucks
poor poor Palintards....Who the fuck do you think was buying this week?
Pltr bottom?
Serious bargain on NIO
I just need PLTR to stay above 24 by next week.
Red December begins
I guess this sub wasn't as good as I thought honestly. Every prediction I've followed past two days just flat incorrect
Fuck im yoloing all my money on the nio dip
How many loss posts will we see today from people betting all their money on short term memestock calls? 

Especially gme. A record number of people got talked into buying at opening
HERE COMES THE V
Dead cat bounce
Is this a bear market
Its only money. Im ok 
Fuck it PLTR calls on discount. Load up boys.
Soooo whats the price point we buy into PLTR?
With APHA, PLTR and GME tanking

I learned one thing from this sub this morning.. do the opposite
tech is about to get it from behind and your sleeping on sqqq
How much money have we lost today
Hey buy that PLTR dip I got 12/31 calls and I'm hemorrhaging thanks.
Can anyone explain that TSLA selloff or just profit taking after the blow off top?
TSLA about to pull a huge head fake on all of you and sell off to 540 today.
Interactive brokers down?
Sold my tesla calls at open for 20% profit and rebought them for 1000 less each and hour later. I'm done for the day. 

12/24 TSLA 600c
Ah well I missed the TSLA dip of the day
Bought hella NIO calls bad or smart
warned you guys about the collapse AMA
You guys think PLTR is gonna fake us out and drill again soon?
Im hearing a short squeeze on PLTR in a week
Last chance to buy the ICLN dip. Not going to moon but its going to continue its climb and this will be the cheapest buy in opportunity

Hint: buy January 15 $25 calls
Im a paper hands little bitch
Tesla you animal..... up $20 in 20 min
Too late to load up on PLTR calls?
Yolo on ZM?
**Grabbed 55c 12/18 and 65c 12/18 CRSR LETSS GOO CONNECCTTTTTTT!!**
Sold NIO
Oi, if I sell a covered call and then buy it back when it tanks in value is that a day trade strike?
PLTR is a full blown pump and dump rn. Be careful yall. They're onto us.
Fuck me I bought an amazon put right at the bottom, glad I cut it early though
PLUG PUMP
V SHAPED RECOVERY

BTFD
Fuck I wish I wasnt such a bitch an had more capital for more Tesla calls
Back on the nio train
SPY puts get them while theyre on sale
Do you guys count the traditional 401k in your net worth after your current tax bracket or before? I have been doing it with a \~50% reduction rate. My wife says most people calculate it before, but I find that misleading unless it was a ROTH 401k.
NKLA put will be free money tomorrow when Trevor sells
That snapback on TSLA was fierce. From +3% to -5% back to flat. Wild.
Im not anything, fuck this. You can see the eod selloff miles away.
What're the chances the market rips up in the afternoon and the indices end sideways?
Can I buy TSLA calls in my dads Tesla from the in car browser
WSB wont be beaten that easily. Pump that shit
You fucking annoying shills dont even have CHWY 12/18 calls
Some of yall are about to get your back broken
God I love MVIS youre my dumb little puppet
AMD so fucking bullish today, like almost unbelievable the strength it has

I feel like a proud mother right now
tsla stock made the tsla logo this morning
more pltr calls its about to break out. Get in on the meme while you still can
People who missed the $TSLA dip should immediately go all in on $ROPE.
It took me way too long to realize this, so maybe it will help someone else. Its nearly impossible to time a perfect trade. But you have a much better chance of timing a good trade. Make good trades and dont try to chase perfect. 

As I nurse the TSLA calls I paid too much for...
I fucked up all 3 days trades today so I switched to options on SPX futures and have completed 7 successful consecutive day trades, only made $122 from /ES futures though but that erases one of my day trade losses
Current positions: 
30K FROG calls
10K C calls
10K WFC calls
5K AAL calls

If you guys havent heard of Planet 13 you should look into it. Its an American company that has the worlds biggest marijuana dispensary in Las Vegas, which some of us might have been too. Place is extremely nice and can very well become a huge franchise dispensary all throughout the country. Theyre opening up another location in LA and with legalization Im sure more will be to follow. It currently trades under $5 and this can be an amazing long term trade at that buy in price. Last thing, the fact that its American is extremely important and because it is that makes it 100x better than all these shitty weed stocks I see people trading.
boring
Any currency guys in here? Curious if the dollar will hold here or take a turn down even further.
My APPL shilling has finally paid off, thank you WSB

Can someone explain to me ***why*** the stock market is down?? Is it algos,  reptilians, the jews? Someone tell me!
This is just a giant dead cat bounce
Any of you actually understand what PLTR does? In laymans terms?

Or its path to profitability? Like how does it start making money? And when?

Im not getting the hype, feels like Im just missing something
Soo we done with PLTR now?
I feel like an idiot but I bought GME. I just dont buy this earnings BS. This store is on its way out in a few years if you ask me
Did the THC meme die? Not sure if I want to sell it to buy more GME
We should send HTZ up to $7 again whos with me
Spy gonna die
Am I missing something? I placed a couple orders for calls on GME & APHA last night and they still haven't been bought; just says "order placed" still. 

Using Robinhood if that matters....
400k sell order at 120 for AAPL lmao
GME puts looking good right about now
Should I hold a 12/4 PLTR 27c overnight? Down 17%
Any thoughts about intel? Seems massively undervalued.

Threatening to keep it. Trying to ruin my life. Supposedly scheduled for abortion this Thursday. My life has been on pause waiting for this day. If the child is born, Im leaving the country.
Yikes PLTR not looking good
PLTaRds in shambles 
I have a question Im fairly new here ..But who is Citron??
I dont understand how people are contemplating buying gme this late in the trend. Where was yall at $3, 5, 8, FUCKING $10? Now yall wanna buy near $20?!
Going to be honest, PLTR looks weaker. Not weak, but weaker. Big wigs are aware of the retail hype, be smart.
Pltr already tanking. GREATTTTTT
Bye PLTR IT WAS FUN THANKS
PLTR clowns coming in with the downvotes hahaha
#MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING I LIKE RULES. NOT TRUE! I AM THE LEAST RULE-LIKING PERSON IN THIS ROOM!

NKLA TOO THE FUCKN  
Joe fractured his hairline 
Im so sick of getting cucked by NIO lately
Option Profit Calc has my NKLA calls only down 78% ? Double down ?
For me after apha, HEXO is the weed stock to get into. Look at their earnings last 3 quarters...set to beat earnings and they are coming up Dec. 16th. Plus they are soundly positioned to become a top company on the market. With the news expect this to deliver a 100 percent return by EOW.
Lmao pltr

Stimmy pump. Get fukt 
I placed a GME call 19c 1/15 on RH this weekend and it says it's only placed and it's not actually purchased? First time with options. It says in ' Effect' that it's open.

To lock in gains without using a daytrade for a long call you sell the put at the level above your call coerect?
Made money on Appl puts this morning...might take the week off for being so damn lucky.
So can we move on to the next meme stock or nah?
Ok.. TSLA play would be a huge part of my portfolio. Whats a safe call date and strike? 

Premium is so damn expensive..
ACB, APHA, or GME? I have $500 to put in

CRSR finally green...now if only we can hit 45 by the end of tomorrow...

Gme shit stock tanking
Im so confident market will tank hard soon Im about 20k deep in some far dated puts rn
I really hope PLTR gang takes profits today. It's going to get ugly. Then again I can't wait to see the gain and loss porn.
GME Short Squeeze cancelled, you think Institutions are really going to be patient for a takeover that may not happen and hold? Profit taking galore! Down 13% from high, I can only imagine the losses tomorrow once the hype evaporates!
Dump GME! cut losses and move on - squeeze will not happen. you have been fooled
PLTR gang will be gone for good by EOW. Downvote if your salty
clown emoji to all the people who downvoted me when I said PLTR is going to $22 today
Abbandon ship fellow pltr stock owners
As Predicted, GME fell below $17. More room to fall.  A PLUMMET OF 15%! Now that's Comedy.
Monday predictions:

-DOW jumps at opening bell

-TSLA pulls back to 585-590 before running to 615

-PLTR spikes to 30 before melting down to 25 by EOD

-AMZN, SHOP, ETSY, TGT melt up all day

-ZM spikes to 500, melts down all day, then spikes AH

-The next meme stonk is currently marinating. I have (2) candidates in my head.
Sell PLTR while its high, its now or never PLTR dead.
Here comes the PLTR freefall. Tried to warn you idiots.
PLTR loss porn today is 
You all ready for the actual drop?
You are , my firrreeeee
My one, desireeeee
(Keep it going)
Fuck Robinhood. I hate missing out on premarket orders. I wanted shares of GME and PSTH.
What's thoughts of GME at open? Dump?
No Idea how long I slept for but it was no longer than an hour or two. Checked GME right away HAH $17.66 still slowly dropping, I'm not very butt hurt that I sold to open the four $17c on friday anymore. Wouldn't be surprised if it's below $12/share when they expire or above $20. 

It coming back down by open might be a giant bull trap disguised as the "epic short squeeze" People in here were literally ready a few hours ago to throw their money at gamestop options immediately at open when shares were over $20 
lol this pltr fade is going to be beautiful
):
PLTR. Hype. Dying.
What can I buy thats not pltr boys
My pooots Im cooooming
Bought my first Tesla put strike 565 expire on the 4th. What do you guys think

TSLA will be added today to the S&P , what impact do you think it will have for tomorrows trading day? 

Edit : as you guys Pointed out , it will be decided how it gets added , which is what I meant by the post but my fault for not being accurate. But the questions remains , how it will affect whether is in parts or all at once ?

This week's meme is SNOW 

# 
Tesla - first playing with warranty numbers to bring company to "profit", which the SEC "investigated" quietly. Then energy credits to show "profit". When are we going to see profit based purely on selling their products? What is the next accounting trick?
All the memes in the world wont stop this house of cards from falling  spy 200
Which spac thats still in the $10 range can I just dump $20k in to have it double in a month or two?
Yes....yes....let the red flow through you Palantir
Too late to buy 2k shares?
Country is full of retarded gay bears. All this good news and SPY still red. Must be Biden
You know the PLTR bulls are doing TA, drawing lines for support and clutching their balls for the bounce
RKT calls on Cyber Monday sale, IV is super low today. You can legit get INTM with a .45 cent option. So if you think the stock will run flat or go up take a look. Its iv = 59% while palantir is trading overvalued calls at IV of 150%
Guhlantir
HOly shit we might test march lows at this rate
Im happy I bought PLTR puts on Friday

Sold Tesla @ 100 shares $593 This morning (Bought about a month ago @ $365 ) 

Trying to time the dip so I can re-latch onto Papa Elon's sweet teet. Thinking $550 might be a good entry point. How retarded am I?
Tesla definitely not overpriced at multiple times the valuation of any other car company. Keep the calls coming boiz.
		Filled	Buy to Open	10		PLTR DEC 4 2020 25.0 Call	Market	2.15		--		--	10:47:53 11/30/20

Lets see if these pay off (got 30 now total with a cost basis of about $2.40)


Edit: up 24% so far, plan is to hit 100% and sell (got a ton of LEAPS in PLTR as is so this was just a quick strike for 7k)
How are my APPL 12/4 $120 calls lookin?

Paper Handed by DISCA Boomer Shares in my Roth and sold at 27.30. 9.5% gain and was all in. Still have some exposure in 1/15 27.5 calls. Lil worried the announcement is gonna flop or we will get caught up in a correction. I hope I'm wrong for the sake of my DISCA bros and my calls.

Remember when Jpow was allowed to make his machines go BRRRRRRRRTTT to prop up the stocks when we were in the thick of the rona. I think China has been doing that they have no accountability after all their government has been able to do what they want for centuries. I had a feeling theyd prop up Nio as to not fall too far behind their rival, US ev. And thats why I bought 2x more puts in pltr than nio a couple hours ago.
COME ON LUMN, BURRY PICKED YOU FOR A REASON
It'll be ok pumpkin pusses
So Nio sticks at the 50-55 area as if its the fair value for this trash -.-

Got my zm put yolo locked and loaded
Can someone that actually understands options (so less than 1% of people on this forum) explain to me why NIO can get crushed today....down $2.20/share to $51.80....down over 4%.

But the $45 puts expiring on the 18th of next month are basically unchanged at $2.30 per contract (+8 pennies / +3%). 

So if tomorrow it opens up down another $2 and goes below $50 per share I can expect the puts to only go up a few pennies? I didn't think that's how it worked....
Zoom puts for fun?
Goddamnit ICLN +/-.00%

GME dump at open is going to be so epic. Hope none of you retards bought pre market.
If GME hits $20 Im buying puts. This pos should not be this high.

IMAGINE BUYING GME AT $19.40 AND LOSING 15% IN THE SAME DAY, ONLY GME! A SHORT SQUEEZE WILL NOT HAPPEN. SORRY TO BURST YOUR BUBBLES, MANIPULATIVE MM'S ALWAYS WIN :)
Guys I actually meditate and see the future two-three days ahead. Please get out of PLTR at bell ring. PLTR will tumble down to its 20s by Monday afternoon. Then a fake pump will buy it to about 23 dollars but then by close it will tumble down to 18$. Be safe. I already purchased a bulk order of 20$ puts for Friday that should pay off.

Everyone is talking about TSLA inclusion as being bullish, but I don't think you're thinking about all sides of the trade. If you're a SP500 holder, you may want to hedge against TSLA downside since you'll be holding it, and take a net short position to cancel it out.

That's what I'm doing...
PLTR more like PooLTR
Fuck you tesla go down
SELL PLTR
So I PLTR really done?
SELL WHILE YOU CAN
So are chinise stocks like baba fucked? Delisting?
PSTH confirmed Stripe acquisition?
ASANA is the next meme stock in a few weeks or month once the PLTR hype dies
If you don't go ballz deep in $NGA, you hate free money
In all of your retarded opinions will PLTR dip more? Waiting to buy in for more leaps, but it had a 50% week last week
Should I just take the L on baba and sell all my shares?
ZM having real short squeeze
Tlry fading hard god damn
Forget PLTR, MSTR is the play this month!
Im soooo glad I dumped my March BABA calls last week at break even. Close call

Is there a beginners guide for newbies? Starting with very low capital
Now that everyone is appropriately aware of PLTRs downside, next time it dips (probably by 2pm) retails will bail
QS tanking after being up 40%
*Bonds offer no yield*

Anyone else buy a boatload of TSLA the day after the S&P announcement and sell the same day for a loss?
At what point does a sub like this take a stock like $HTZGQ and give it the rocket fuel it needs to go parabolic? I guess the autists all have robinhood and can't even buy an OTC ticker. Damn shame.
Careful today setting up for tomorrow red as fuck dirty red day
TSLA

Been a while since we've had a big long dump day.  Seems like a good day for it.
I like how everybody is micro analyzing each individual stock and why its down when Everything is being brought down at once, well minus a few exceptions.

Why is NKLAs price moving on RH right now?
VIX is up 4.5%. Are you guys morons lol
PLTR gang dead, even VIX is doing better today
Considering that GME is trading higher than its price as of Dec 2017, I think this moon mission is going to end Apollo 13 style.
Edit: I already 100 shares of the underlying. I'm not attempting to sell naked puts/calls on RH you downies.

What does "This order introduces infinite risk" mean in robinhood? I can't ask this question on the RH sub or WSB because the goddamn fucking morons keep deleting/removing my posts. Hard to take those fucking clowns seriously when their algorithm cans legit questions about their shitty fucking software. So, anyone with some answers here? Apparently, the content guidelines thinks my technical questions belong in the general discussion, instead of, ya know, the actual RH sub. Fucking morons.
why are cruises down??
Welp Great GME Pump WSB! Hope you sold earlier td for 2% gains because the downfall has only just begun. No other stock blows their load early like GME, SAD!
GME running out of steam for the day.
I wouldn't be long in this market right now considering its is at all time high, it has limited upside but unlimited downside potential at the moment. Like we saw this morning with oil news. Buy Calls at your own risk.

imagine not buying this here
GME 12/18 16.5p looking good ngl
Die Amazon die!!!
My account took a 30% jump by staying the fucking away from PLTR and GME...always invest these pile of retards.
Sleepys decision to adopt German shepherds appears to have been a bad one, considering it took about a month to shatter his ankle.
Premarket flashing some pretty bearish flags boys, I would close out your riskiest longs for the next few days just to feel out the market sentiment some more
Holy shit markets are blood red dont think Ive seen this since March, glad I exited my positions in $PLTR and $GME
selling pltr. now or after open?
This fucking trash sub needs to be banned and investigated by SEC

Yall buying memes when you can buy PSTH...
And that my friend, is how you fuck these retarded meme traders. Thank you, come again
Can someone tell me exactly when the short squeeze will happen and exactly how high it will go?   I need to put a sell order in.
I think Nikola, with post-Trevor Milton leadership, is hesitant to sign a Badger deal. Theyre fully focused on fuel stations (primary business case), semi trucks (secondary), and powersports (tertiary...although I could see these falling off the base plan as well). A hydrogen fuel station partner will be important for sure, but not a Badger. This MOU with GM also opens up the option for Nikola to procure fuel cells without limitations as the original deal would have limited them to using GMs Hydrotec worldwide with the exception to Europe, which would have been Boschs fuel cells...thus allowing the company to better negotiate fuel cell costs.
So could baba get delisted?
Cashapp me a dollar to attend the annual lynching tomorrow $ballingsince67

Crash Please CRASH!! Save my 1x TSLA 500P 4/12
May I have your attention, please?

May I have your attention, please?

Will the real To the Moon Stock please stand up?

I repeat, will the To the Moon Stock please stand up?

We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a red day before

Jaws all on the floor like WSB like Elon just burst in the door

And started whoopin' our ass with red candles worse than before

They first entering the SP500, throwin' up green days (agh!)

It's the return of the "ah, wait, no way, you're kidding

He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"

And JPowell said, nothing, you idiots!

JPowell's dead, he's now replaced by Yeltsin (ha ha!)

Feminist women love WSB

"Chicka, chicka, chicka, WSB, I'm sick of them

Look at them, walkin' around, sending stocks to the moon

Flippin' the boomers too soon"

"Yeah, but they're so autistic though"

Yeah, We probably got a couple of screws up in our heads loose

But no worse than what's goin' on in the bears' bedrooms

Sometimes I wanna get on r/investing and just let loose

But can't, but it's cool for Mango to Tweet and make us wanna noose

"Red Dildo is on your lips, Red Dildo is on your lips"

And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss

And that's the message that we deliver to little autistic kids

And expect them not to know what a $Rope day is

Of course they're gonna know what YOLO is

By the time they hit fourth grade

They've got the Robin Hood, don't they?

We ain't nothin' but Bulls/Bears, well, some of us theta, they cannibals

Who sell other people calls and puts and make money like animals

But if we can take a red day on our yolos

Then there's no reason we can't go to the moon on a stock solo

But if you feel like I feel, I got DD to yolo

Autists, wave your allowances, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm real WSB, yes, I'm the real WSB

All you other little WSBers are just imitating

So won't the real WSBers please stand up

Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm WSB, yes, I'm the autist

All you other autists are just imitating

So won't the real WSB please stand up

Please stand up, please stand up?

Thanks for the laugh. Also working.
Wow what a personal attack!

You think it's easy losing this much money?
Clown school is more selective than Harvard
Really hope Jeff sees this and finally considers an AMZN split as well. If he doesn't he's no longer going to be the richest person in the world (soon).
ARKK prediction of $4000 pre split might actually come true
I get this reference.
Never understood the appeal. Pay double the price for a meal thats cold by the time it reaches you.
Still cheaper than a DWI.
You can put a price on convenience and laziness.
I don't get it either. But there are people who are TERRIBLE at money management. My neighbors will routinely pay $25+ for a 12-pack of doctor pepper and gummy worms from fucking 7-11 on DD. I cant understand.
so much this
In theory I agree, in practice, jerking off 30-40 times a day takes a serious physical toll on your body
Do you jerk off?
What if I make like 20 plays a day?
might aswell just try it 
Yes
Pretty much, yes.
Well.... Maybe no since PLTR is in death row rn
Dont buy GME weeklies please. Stonks.
Take PLTR if you like being fucked in the was. That's what it's done to me.
Fantastic analysis.

Literally sold and doubled down at the dip. To the fucking moon
Champ gang reporting in
Let me get a turn 
PLTR is like a 50% chance it ends the week red tbh. No hate but right now its a hype stock with not much to back it until it has a solid ER next quarter
MRNA EUA isnt happening until the latter part of December
Almost downvoted you because your first sentence seemed bearish.
They dont get downvoted for saying something bad about PLTR (pbuh) they get downvoted for being  and wrong
I hope to join you in this quest 


For the land of tendies is the best 


Fuck the haters, theyre the worst 


Im hoping that this bubble doesnt burst

Looking at my account just makes it go down
How about you suck on deez nuts instead?
Born 5 years too late
You could have bought plenty of other stuff in 1984, sold it all and then bought AAPL in 1997 and you'd have way more money than that.

Hahahahahha
I damn hope so, I FOMO'd last week when they were at their highest
Most are waiting for the bell to buy afaik
I hope youre right bby
hope ur right 
You sir, are correct.
If everyone played their latest suggested shorts, theyd all be broke. 
Bet you said that Friday
No harm in selling at $28 hoping to buy back in later at $20-25
For real. If youre panic selling stock 1 hour into market open on a Monday wtf are you doing
Or leaps
You got more to lose, get back in there
almost same here..the real question is should i take a loss or lose more by holding?
Try to make it all back, you have three tries for this week
haha those are rookie #'s
Lets faking goooooo
Nope...on our way back to $600+ today.  
good cause i bought at the top
This aligns with my narrative so therefore I upvote
Yessir!
I'm hoping we only close the week at 30 cause I wrote 31c weeklies for stupidly cheap against my shares. I'd rather not get cucked by that, but totally deserve it if so.

My eyes are starting to bleed but I'm not fucking leaving!
I might go in on GME also 
When you speak to him next time, can you please tell him to forward me those Citron nudes?
Biiiiiiiiiggggg

Still holding 12/4 35c not selling
When I first heard about it I googled how to spot a short squeeze ahead of time thinking I found the secret to making millions easy mode 

Turns out all you need to do is find a stock with high shortage and then get millions of soon to be bag holders to buy in lol
When the little 'uns amongst us squeeze onto their tip toes to grab beer from the top shelf
Easy

Hours*
$130
Why would you fucking short when passive money to the tune of trillions still has to buy a 1% stake by Dec 20. They can't do it all at once, they can't buy that much in advance because that's too much risk for whoever runs the fund. Also so many people that take advantage of how passive money has to pour in mechanically at the top, adding to the buying pressure.
LOL
 Who's the best in every way and wants to sing this *song* to say, who's your friend who likes to play?  PLTR! PLTR!
SS bro. I cant finish to just words
Anxious to see what my 12/24 $700c are up to
why the fuck would you sell that
What price did you sell and what price do you want to get back in at?
Omg same.
Clearly
Wrong way? It's just starting. Saturn 5 had only 1% more thrust than it's weight at lift off and guees where it to us?

This is the way.
Sold at the top, and bought the 24 dip.
*The boulevard of broken memes
boulevard of broken memes
you got in cheap, nice work not stop bitching and enjoy your profits in 3-9 months
I already bought 250.
 no
Already balls deep in, but I just made some tendies on the PLTR dip so fuck it, why not. 100 more, coming right up
I bought 70000 last week.
I bought 1000 earlier, so you guys needs to step up.
lmao
Lul the people talking about a rumor are just trolling. If you look at their post history most of them a bears that's just fuking with people's emotions.
The true gains are the memes we made along the way.
I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
PLTR is just giving others a chance to buy; its consolidating at this price for now
Bahahah
Dude it amazes me how scared people are during trading and they never change. This is why we get tendies and they dont
If you have cash to buy dips then you shouldn't be here
Lmao
LoL in Dan Gilbert
900$*
My guy
A P X T looking pretty juicy as well
The finest
Yes, if you have the patience for it to pop.
Yes
GME i dont trust but PLTR definitely
grats mate
Never
Nice try.
Wsb would win
If so, Im buying the shit out of GME.

GODSPEEED
Bitch Im out of money
reporting for doody
Easy as apple pie
Thats like me with my 2/21 calls ahahhhhh I gotta not sell for a loss rn
I can't believe I saw people asking if they should sell their May calls because of that dip. 
fuck em lol
What about 23 
\*ain't
no kidding i was getting burned but i held on
If you bought pot stocks this is a walk in the park.
fucking pussies it disgust me that im part of that war
  
Made a few hundred on puts Im good
we know our time will come around Dec 3. 

We out here

Every day I wake up, see 30% gain and get itchy fingers, tell myself that paper hands are the cause of all pain, and then slowly watch my gains bleed. Why am I not just selling at open and buying $2 cheaper every day
Wondering where the gainz went
Needs help everyone buy
The most volatile shit Ive ever seen. Make your damn mind up over there.
??? Selling at open when IV is inflated can be a smart play
Nah I would've missed that cyber monday sale on PLTR if I'd done that
How do I buy the dip if I always miss it
Then you miss all the PLTR being up 10% and then falling like a rock fun
Bullish
I thought they did pretty good with their stationary bike production.

She aint legal yet
They have micro stocks for micro penises. Check em out
What is holding it? It was getting pumped early today but now its flat af

And the survey saysssss.... no
I wasn't happy with 500% on my 20c 12/4 calls at open. I need 25 eow.
I expected more tbh, but ur right
dicks always out anyway but sure , for Harambe
So ghey
How much u down?
Youre welcome $ROPE
KING
40 EOW
Bet
I see 28... let's gooo!
Lets gooo
LETS GOOOOOO!!!!!
Youll be fine. They trying to shake out paper hands.
This Chad gets it. As if PLTR is the only stock down right now lmao
I aint selling when i down 5%
Right? When Im watching porn Im gonna switch screens when I feel a pat on my shoulder and not when I hear fucking steps across the street
Its hilarious that mods have been removing GME posts because WSB is inciting a short squeeze
When will the squeeze happen? Did today go as expected to you for G.M.E?
Yes!

Do we already have a clear date for that btw?

Buy shares to help create the squeeze
Its happening bro 
Will the squeeze be one day or multiple?
DONT MISS OUT
To the moon 
just buy itm calls and shares. that will do the job.
R wave coming plz
Stay
Let us join hands in prayer, to JPOW and Pappa Thiel we pray
YES
Im holding my shares but sold my calls at a profit, its looking too volatile right now.
Down 70% and still holding
Literally all my homies hate fucking Citron
First off fuck your bitch and the stocks you tank PLTR til I die
Me too. Options are too dangerous right now.
I had to change into diapers because I almost shit myself.
Yup shares or Leaps
Mate are you me? I legit had the same thoughts just now lool
We forget about CRSR already?
I check RH because the scary account number is in ToS
PLTR shares are one of the smartest investments you could make right now.  


Options are usually retarded, buy shares so you don't have to time this volatility to make big dick gains.
Wait really?
Don't kill those fucking chickens. I LIKE CHICKEN TOO
Sauce?
I'll allow it
Condolences.
A long while back people wouldve switched the order of those two when saying that lmao

yeah youre supposed to just keep buying it and then when its had enough it squeezes the pp
All week long bby.  Financials DEC 8
Its coming. Get in now, youll be happy soon
Don't buy more
Thats actually the best way to do it, but make that one week rather than 2 hours and, baby, youve got a stew going
Sometimes thats how you have to do it. I have missed so many big gains by watching my screen every two seconds and panic selling on a big dip, only then to see it go to all time highs a week or two later. Its tough, but just close the screen and go outside when youre feeling impulsive.
Mars you say? I like the sounds of that.
Bears not letting it break resistance
Should have bought now instead of this morning :/
Sold my Nio and went into gme. Hope it pays off.
Stop trying to pump it
Its just taking a break, as am I, IV is too god damn high. Be back next week to enter at $35 on the way to $40
Bullish or bearish?
Same
ditto
Same
Whats your play?
Me too. You getting a lambo too?
they better 
Dont forget the 130% efficacy vaccine
and weed...
$30 premarket tomorrow. Cyber Monday sale today.
Same, it's kinda lame. Depending on how these next 13 minutes go, I could wind up with a nice big fat net +0 on the day. 

Waste of my timeeee 
We'll see $600 before noon today.  If anyone is not on the TSLA  yet, get on board at opening - you'll profit by noon.
Half the episode will just be last episodes cliffhanger... boooring.
That one was a freebie though lol
Any a hole could of told you that
Wasnt that Hindenburg who called out NKLA?
Rad
Absolutely. Shitron shorts, stock goes up. Like clockwork.
I would love it. Took out big money to claim im "premed"
Executive Order
fantastic
Lol
How long does it take you to make that lol
Good job sir
Yea sonnnn 
I called your mom. You were right, she appreciated it.
Especially when it's only been open for an hour, already saw 5 guys get off the rocket
Some retard here posted about short squeeze
this is so wrong step-market....
Yeah Ive always wondered how that works. Even a bad 5% day down means the whole thing must be going to 15 dollars again
Retards aborting the ship
Those people don't belong here. 
Is it wrong to encourage it so they leave? Its like stealing candy from a retard.
Oof too soon
strike date?
Loooool ikr, these tards think their monthly rent money is going to pump a public market when Morgan Stanley has enough money to probably buy a country
Im not fucking selling.
God I hope soo
This is so true.

Out of day trades?
I bought what you sold 
itll proly get sold off again like it does every morning
Ive been holding PLTR long enough that it wasnt even on this subs radar
Yeahhhheeeeyaayy!
MSOS
;-;
Give it time. These tendies are hand made.
Chill it out dude wait for tomorrow morning then sell
U seein what Im seeing on the 15 min 
I just buy shares. Bought in at 9, at 12, at 14, at 19, and at 24. 

It'll allll be fine.

Unless you bought 40c 12/4.
Yep. 1750 shares with $16 average
I bought 300 pltr shares and im down 2k rn, should I be worried or just hold long, you don't seem to be worried about the current shorting happening to pltr
Eh it hits 30 again selling my longer dated and swapping to shares I think
What's a share?
GME is peak autism stock
I got my lunch packed up, my boots tied tight...hope I dont get in a fight...ohhhhhh GME
i love you
Have you considered crying while looking in a mirror?
I feel this differently
Yep.. people are crazy for selling
I'm not.
I did at 27 but my avg is also 15 so idgaf
You missed the dip
It's the perfect storm of autism, degeneracy, and FOMO.
I think mojo jojo was powerpuff girls.  Otherwise, solid dd.
Bought in today 12/11 22C lol starting to feel like a gap down is in the works for tomorrow morning lol one of the first times I've bought in following trend. Usually I wait for reversal signals for counter trend moves. Let's see how it goes.
Yarp. Im still super bullish in the long


I really wouldnt sweet PLTRs future
I'd say GME is much safer than PLTR.

Forget all the short squeeze nonsense, just zoom out and see every console release causes a good bump in share price.

This time they are also getting a bite out of the digital sales made on consoles they sold from their stores, so every unit sold is future revenue.

Just at the bottom of this "console cycle" that won't end until after the holidays. I'd say mid 20's and maybe $30 is almost certainly in the realm of reasonable possibilities.
pltr
Obviously GME, then PLTR after its $100.
PLTR my boy
why not split your position between both PLTR and PLTR?
Both
GME price target increase to $20 by #MOASS
Dont be like these retards, PLTR is done.. GME just hit 20 PM... this is the way
Split
GME
cant make this stuff up
you were gonna do that anyway
Dabs my ninja. It's 2020. No need to smoke that much to get high.
lambos* the squeeze hasnt happened yet
Im doing this you do this someone make a post later
I'll do my part!
Yes
Well, which one?
You mean $32?

literally on the front page of this subreddit dawg

He just made another post to make us all look more like village idiots
Wut?
leggggoooooo!
APHA is the flavor of the week for dank stonks
APHA and CGC both better weed stocks than ACB
I feel like nobody has a clue what's actually going to happen with PLTR
Look at shorts bro. Totally real + meme

GME $50 EOY
25 by Wednesday 
F
LMAO
stay bitch

Its because retards bought weeklies at crazy high iv...they are probably down 70-80%
Right? I ain't selling shit
Right? People lost prespective of how a rising stock usually moves
BUY GME
TRI-monthly culling of WSB -> Market enters Hard Mode -> hard mode for 1-2 months -> A New Meme Rises -> Stonks go UP  -> Stonks ONLY go up (Euphoria Phase) -> TRI-monthly culling of WSB
I got rid of my margin and went into a large chunk of cash gang at open on some old positions.

Bought more PLTR just a minute ago and grabbed a ZM play for ER too

The overall market is down a chunk and people are tightening their belts not looking to yolo is all
Exactly. The whole market is red. Relax. Wait. And watch money rise
Say it louder
True, PLTR already back up, but boy everything looks red today.
We all learn this lesson hard the first time. All or nothing baby!
Anybody actually these stocks staying that low
No?
pic? Dont see it
What if you bought them for $1.18 at open and sold them for $1.84 6 minutes and 59 seconds later?

:) sneaky I am 59% gain in under 7 minutes
this is the way.
Who on earth would think thats a good idea???
Im never fucking leaving.
Bro it's red rn.
 never learn its unbelievable
Prob more govt secrecy
Pltr moon
They probably had something to do with yesterday's bombing in Iran.
There is nothing better for hyper valuation than secrecy. What until this crowd turns into a brigade of supporters online.
They have security clearances so doubt it, which is why they dont have much in the way of competition.
What N word?
It's a yoyo today.
Hope that prints for you
Welcome brother, here we go!
We gonna get rich together
3500 here. Will keep buying more as we go 
Lets go baby
Thanks sweaty sack 69
This helps affirm my pre-existing bias, so I will upvote you now.
I think you could be right. I just doubled down on my calls. Picked up some 12/18 $25 calls. Was already holding 12/18 $20 calls.
What makes you say this?
Be ready for what? I hope your not selling
you pay full price for a share and when you turn it in for 5% of the original price, just like old times 

JK holding this shit to the moon
Got 100 shares. Will sell if it hits fucking $80.
This.
You know they have earnings next week right?
Depends how much money and time they have lol
This is what I did, crazy premium which is nice. Would be ok if I got assigned on Friday even.
yup.  leaps the way to go
Congrats and fuck you
Big oof, I went from 2k to 900 back to 1800 now sorry man
[deleted]
Give it a little time. This type of consolidation at this volume is healthy for the next move up. Hundreds of millions of shares trading into stronger hands above $25. January and February ATM calls are the real play here.
THIIIICCCCC BOIIII 
Lol me too I got like 450 shares today
[deleted]
Why bruh
That's what I didn't want to do today at +20, +30, +50 and +70%. Oh and at +110%... 

Where we at now?
Bought 1,000 shares at .29, now .73. My only pennystock and worth it!
Same. Love to see it
YES!
what do u think
I bought 33x 12/4 25c's when it dropped 
What i was thinking as I bought the dip... if half of whats posted on here anymore is actually true we have a community full of true retahd autist 4 sure....I just come here for the LOLs
Imagine going short when it was at -10% few hours ago. xD
> Im a pathetic loser and will leave the market having lost all my gains cause of greed

This is your home
How
Well, wait until it goes up for a while and buy it all back.
Buy high sell low baby
Tell her to get GME
lmaooo
It's a put party
My calls would like that too plz
I would have an accident in my pants
Nah dawg we need to load up more

hhahaahah
LFGOOOOOOO
LFGOOOOOOOOOOO
Oh shit it actually is
Hopefully but not today sadly
Same. diverted all that money into ICLN January calls
Predictably
Its high volume and down %. Go look up what that means on the internets.
All tech is getting pinned. Not just PLTR
Whats causing it?
first day trading gme?
Its funny you think its a selloff. It's just more people shorting.

Almost the entire volume of available stock is short.
For real. I'm dumping a lot into this and keeping some cash for Roblox.
As in they also suck in making an actual profit?
This is the way. Only one % left before it moons
Just people who are mad they missed the PLTR ride.

Not even sure why theyre on this sub if they cant handle a stock being memed.
sold Friday. at 31. Bought the dip again at 26.40ish. Time to go back to ATH
imagine selling at the bottom today. F
Tell em dude. Im down to expire worthless haha
Paper hands deserve to be poor.
THC and HCA are fueling up
Ppl here only buy stocks when they are up a lot, not when they go on sale
Quite shocking.
2 weeks? Lol
They need to similuate a few more zeros on my bank account then
No, were in a alien AI hedge fund.
Its literally 10 guys with $500 to play with with a bunch of bots on wsb unleashed by Bill Gates and Buffett to make them more billions with a fake market
What so bull about gme?
Non binding too so they can refuse
NKLA is officially....... DEAD!
No kidding, the most interesting part of the deal is scrapped.
50% on friday but hey not complaining
God I hope
Thanks for the news update.
How far will it run you think?
i missed the boat, big sad
They arent with us anymore. RIP.

Why would GameStop go $50
I know. Should of bought the dip
Does it look like its going to?
Did my part and bought a FD $30c 12/04
Its been half an hour
Lmao
My man
That's the spirit we need in here
F
no, die
You just know these retards will load up on more shorts tho iTs bLoCkBuStEr
I tried, then tried again. 
Cya tomorrow
Time for some good DDs.
Shhhhhh
Reporting for duty
Itll make a slow climb up to 30 eoy that initial rise was too insane
I disagree, it was not above $30 for all that long, $28 we will see some selling and I think $30 is in play if the dip keeps getting bought up
Selling my 12/04 31 covered call last week, cuz i know them retards like to play weekly  
bringing us all back to life
Well see Im still pretty happy
fuck
loal
Hahaha vagine
Squish your pp onto the screen at it, thats what Im doing
Im guilty of that
Tripled down.  PLTR will never close below $25 ever again.
Holy shit, is your entire account in PLTR?
 
did you almost paper hands hahahah?? I was getting really close
holy shit lol
Congratulations, fuck you
Cant relate. However, losing 1000 oh yeah totally
Taxes tho
Doubled my calls on the dip.  We'll see how it goes.
Engage Swedish made penis enlarger
Predication for ATH?

Looks like its got good support at 17. Expect a run up to earnings

That would be hilarious lol

Why not just buy the stonks at that point? Granted they won't pay dividend, like ever, so I may as well...
Brutal, its happened to me and Ive still made minimal effort to learn the Greeks
Been there done that. Will never forget watching one single tick of a candle (about 1-2 seconds) and seeing my option value tank $700 per contract.

Fucking YIKES
Gonna go to $14 minimum by Jan earnings
Hey me too, just sold that stupid meme stock, Aapl and picked up a bunch of call options on ENRN. Let's moon baby!
You mean your NKLA stocks?
If you're someone who takes screenshots when you're green, it's probably a signal for you to sell and not double down.
Loaded up
yep
I don't get it...but maybe I'm not seeing what you are. How are the following not good for options

IWM: -2.14% at the low
SPY: -1.18% at the low
DOW: -1.43% at the low 

I get these aren't 5-10% moves but still movement and profitable for those with puts. Trading side ways currently, but I'm sure no one thinks it will remain that way before eod today.

Explain to a fellow retard
High or low volume
Just like NIO on its big red days a few weeks back. Massive accumulation going on for the next leg up. Idiotic to sell right now in my opinion. Would be loading more if I wasnt tapped out on other plays.
Everyone that can't see the parallels between early TSLA and current PLTR should just stop investing. I know 90% in here are dumb shits that don't invest anyways but my answer is for the 10%.
Oh. Up as I wrote.
Up.
Up we fly!
Congrats youll double that by tomorrow
Im only wishing you luck because it would benefit me too...

But Im only about 8k deep
Good luck retard
APHA 
APHA loading zone. Liftoff commencing
What about people that bought it in the first place?
We havent seen the top yet
Today's top... The top is at 63$
Its become a meme stock but the company is legit this thing will blow up hugely

turn your phone off. Go for a week vacation. Come back and cash in
then wait until they are green
100 million volume and zero movement. This shit is about to fucking ROCKET
Kinda funny when the trade bots do that
It's probably gonna sit at exactly $27 for the rest of the day, just to fuck with us.
Beats 24 i guess.
Tighter than 2 coats of paint here eh
Yeah crazy if this is overlooked; just hoping it closes above $26.14 and $21 exponential moving average
And Harambe
I can get PLTR on a discount soon

console season baby
Yes
YES HOP IN RETARD
When you put it this way...
Of course we are, were retards.
Haha

Yup. Most everyone bailed, yet it keeps quietly climbing.

Did they really??

Not a shit post suprisingly.
Cause meme stonk
Do you even look at this sub? Theres been 2 or 3 giant DD posts.
Has been going on all year, squeeze wasnt a secret
Yeah
Calls when trump holds a press conference there
Do you believe in life after love after love after love after love after love
I just dont wanna touch it.  In the end GME is doomed, and right now all you can do is try to profit off institutions trying to compete against those who are short on it
Definitely remember people saying Burry had lost his mind for buying it
there's nothing to be salty about it's not up all that much
GME TO THE MOON 
Bees buzzing to the moon
Will we run or dump at open
LETS FUCKING GO BOIS 
PUMP PUMP PUMMMMP 
This is the way

Stairs up, elevator down
Down $2,700 on 400 shares. Sell limit $37.50. No fear. Just retarded.
it only took me down to 200% total return tho 
still holding 12/4 40c. LETZGO
PLTR SHARES! This stock will moon. I still think predicting the exact week is crazy hard, but it will. Watch bears
Have a 30c 12/31, I have time to watch it rocket back up eventually only for theta decay to drill me into the core of the earth
I cancelled my 24.30 stop sell, and rode the fucking thing. thinking: YOLO. I'll be buried in my grave with my 150 shares
They'll be back to buy higher in the next rally
Thc
standing by 
I regret to inform you I have parted ways with the Tuscan raiders after being disappointed on numerous occasions

Bears...smh 
Even I noticed that, it is market manipulation but I've never seen stuff like this in 5 yrs of investing.
It's an efficient market because they just calculate one oscillation and scale it for the different stocks
If you call making 7$ boring I dont know what to tell you
Agreed
Yeah :/ I am too, but with a clinched butthole
autist here, however I bought at 19
you were told to buy and hold them
lmfaoo, it ended the day green u ungrateful swine
Look at the stock over the last 6 months.  It goes up and pulls back, but it marches higher overall.  Today was still a green day for the stock.  Just don't paper hands and you get to zoom on the next jump
APHA
 APHA 
Which APHA should I be looking at?
 Imagine putting your faith in a dying company in Gamestop while buying at the top of a 6 year price channel

Imagine imagining imagination
Imagine not understanding that no one here is actually investing in the company and no one need to have faith in anything as they are playing a potential technical short squeeze
Sir this is a Hertz
Didnt we do that with HTZ... nothing new here
Nah I dont think you can loose here this month should just run

These swings are giving me a headache.
Apple is half of my portfolio and I'm tired of seeing it go sideways for the last 3 months.
New iPhone model is sold out everywhere too
Or they couldnt make as many this year because of manufacturing issues
Its been sold out for weeks now. I had the same idea months ago, but looked at AAPL over last couple years, new iphone doesn't do anything to stock price. 

  
The only reason they're up at all today is cause someone gave them a price target increase.
All my homies hate 
A lot of whales have jumped on GME though, thats true
Lol
I'm thinking to Mars but hey, I'll take the moon as a pitstop.
But will it hit $40 by 12/18? I think its possible. Long shot but possible
Reporting for duty, sir
$40 EOW right?
Same here! Holding contracts expiring next year.
DIAMOND HAND DIAMOND HANDS 
It's not the destination, it's the journey
gottem
i fucking laughed
Boom, roasted.
Im a big fat pussy
this is wsb, if anything the poor bastard lost his excuse to do it
Low key: he loves eating caca
Killa bees steadily going up im satisfied
Trusting the plan. Two more weeks. WWG1WGA!
I am trying to close out of my positions to try to get in...  I don't think it will stop at 13% this week.  Wsb hype is behind it, good luck, trade irresponsible!
Depends my PT is like 35 and I think thats extremely reasonable to see before Jan 1st
If you hope for the short squeeze, it doesnt matter, just buy in. If not, well, wait for the dip I guess. I bought in.
Do. Not. FOMO. Wait for a dippy
paper gains until he sells but yeah that boy is up
Someone giving financial advice in here?

This is a casino
Bid asks are a hell of a drug
Just extremely low volume.
In just trying to get someone to sell to me for cheaper. I want on this ride before all the market buys at open send this vertical.
Fucking amazing
pretty good, u?
Awesome!  Happy most of WSB is preoccupied with PLTR and GME and letting TSLA rise uninterrupted.  We're about the enter Plaid mode very soon as the S&P date approaches!  It's going to be wild ride up.
Rock hard
Same. Buying Friday morning offset my PLTR loss for the day
$40 for the OG
40!!!!!!
Ya somebody find that fucking guy
Wat
Andrew went long Friday
For a tiger cub, yea.
For a newborn Siberian tiger yes.
Damn that pussy phat.
Second
 all fucking in
Dump during the first hour, up by EOD
PREPARING FOR LIFTOFF
Do it.
got in as well lol tryna see where this goes
How steep was the hill?
They couldnt have paid me enough to be in that shit jesus
Gravity acts on both of them to be fair
Why do people keep buying that garbage?
It was probably a computer, but yeah, fuck that computer and fuck NKLA
haha. Def not me. I bought at 31....
Seriously, bears are fucking retarded and even the smallest red the retards start coming out of the fucking woodwork
my cgc shares are fucked. i wish they would just get assigned already so i can wheel back in
Wont get passed good old Mitch boi
Buy theres no dip today
Was wondering about that
Can't take my eyes off of NKLA train wreck. It's so beautiful 
cant wait for that sweet honey
THEY PUSHED THE TRUCK DOWN A HILL! This was the most obvious fraud for public companies I can remember.
Ya weed 
pretty easy to sell calls not sure what you're smoking lol
Always has been
Buy Palantir. KODK
Lmao how long have you been bagholding puts 
Are we doing good?!
agreed, im up 300% on calls in $CGC bought friday
Its legit undervalued compared to CGC and other meme plays. APHA is a real company with real brands. Long APHA $20 
I am ready to scrape the floor of mars :)
Feels bad man :/
yeah wtf just happened?
Yeah its this thread rotating hahahahahaha
GME 
Does this mean we should never bet against daddy citron?
Earlier I said I hope the Palantards get ruined and I get a better entry price. This is looking juicy now
oh GME isnt a good buy at $19 per share? Huh? 
lol.
More like 23$$$ 
This is WSB sir, weeklies are all we know.
yeah they're all in on weekly's... meanwhile my 80k share position with an average cost of 21 (including some IPO and some ATH shares) will just sit here and wait til this stock is 50 per share next year
Chill just buy gme
Friday wasnt bad though
Its hungover from the holiday weekend. Be selective but buy the dip. Today there is a little panic but just let the news cycle catch up.
Yessir
I just bought 60 more shares and I'm not fuckin selling
I sold NKLA at $31 premarket, jumped back in at $22. Taking HYLN dick in the ass too though.
I just took a massive short position, and sitting here wishing I'd had the conviction to do it last week when it was in the 30s. Didn't want to bet on GM not being willing to shovel money into a fire.
Nice
Respect. At least you cant paper hands your hairline /s

Good on you man, Ill probably be joining you in a few years :)
Same
Share gang also gets to average down.
why is it falling??
Truth
Same,   can try and shake me but I stand unshaken

im glad to hear someone say that
sounds like you will regret it more
Ima buy more right quick.
PLTR looking strong still
Gonna cum
Sentimental
You have never done coke while one 2 hits of X while sitting shotgun in a car chase.

post screenshots
Big yikes. What were the plays?
Hey Mr. panda wake up. Its Mr.  here to let you know this is a dream. Just not the good kind
Same but thats ok I was +20k last week, this roller coaster is fun
Not until you sell
They're going to be bigly
Might sell off half my shares when I break even
Different set of retards. 'Fresh meat' as they're known.
Sounds like you bought the top tbh
Honestly who is going to buy a put to exercise when they can just buy the stock and wait 4 days for it to double
Did u paper hand
What position?
What strike price if you dont mind me asking? Im doing theta gang rn
Theta Gang is loving this shit
Could
Lets hope so
Doubt
Bubble? Is that a new Tech stock IPO? whats the listing price?

Calls on BBBL
The stock market is not manipulated to go up or down
The trading paralysis I experienced this morning with BABA was scary. I nearly capitulated. Then I bought the fucking dip.
I think its more like Chinese water torture.  Slow drip.
Always wonder how people jerk off with those things
Oof
This the same guy that said he was up 35k a couple minutes ago haha
Dude, WTF.
Nobody cares you're getting a sex change
You misspelled 2020
Lol no
Stock split when Biden is officially in office. Mark my words.
Why worst

APHA calls 1/17/21 for the nuggies
If youre holding equities/ non weekly options, just dont look at your portfolio today lol
Shit sucks
it only works if we all believe
Its having trouble holding $18
U cant get my dick hard like that I thought it was hovering around 18.8
Algos are programmed to cause whiplash to knock out stops.
I paperhanded the fuck out of my calls and sold on the dip. Right there with you bro
They saw your stop loss the second you placed it and decided to just go for it. ACB dipped this morning just to screw you.
Hoping for a +5% day tomorrow
Im just holding it as passive income
What does this mean?
Bro what dip
Get up ROCK! GET UP AND FIGHT!
did you buy on the very bottom :( I sold too early lol...
Ngl I sold some positions but my DAC was like 17$ rofl bought back in anyway
I was up 170% on my puts, with my whole portfolio..... i broke even.
Good! Now go $ROPE you dumbass bear.
I'd eat that ass for these PLTR calls to print
I'd do it regardless.
Bro she has huge milkers hell yea brother for some Boomer shares EZZ
i would for nothing
Yes. It would probably kill her though.
I would have sex with Pelosi for free my guy, for 80 she looks pretty damn good
Her skin is almost translucent and it looks like she doesn't produce body heat. Of course i would
id give her and john podesta all the children in my family for them to eat
APHA ACB both to $20.
10c should be easy then

LFGOOOOOO
Yes fucking sir
YESSIRRRR
My guy 
Theta this month
From +2 to + 200$, bipolar day!

Im gonna die on the pltr pump hill.
Not this fella right here
Also wait what are you talking about, its been trading flat for couple hours now lol
Hold the line comrades, Im here too!
What a champ
Doing your part
Happy birthday tho
birthday tax
Happy birthday, hopefully it was on a fun stock
Not too late at all everyone hop on
Why do you think it should be valued higher than it's current $47 billion market cap?
Confident about earnings?
...or
T=20
S=19
L=13
A=1

SUM =53.....then 5+3 = 8 * 100 (since options) and we're looking at our target of $800.
The math checks out sir, this guy stonks
Autism  speaks
Just hold ?
Hopped on last Monday, should I throw some more money at it or leave it?
     calls up 30% today
Buy it buy it buy it. How could it go wrong?
This isn't a shit company like ACB, you're good
Let it rest for a bit, this is a long game
Yea but it was up 20% ... so its effectively down 12% now. Blood red
Thank god somebody said it
but the short bro!!! VW went up 800 dollar!!11!! SO GME HAS TO DO THE SEAME!!!

Calls or shares?
Lmao
Lmfaoo

Edit: here https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9d6cfcca-acf5-4296-aac3-8ae72bd670bd
Dont get me excited
this is the way
We are looking good
Haha... Same - but central
seems like they can... wasn't Moderna 95% effective 2 weeks ago?

All they did were like, yup... same results guys... buy buy buy!
No vaccine pump today. Dow is big red. My guess is Moderna gets roadblocked today.
Can we do NVAX next Monday? That guy's DD was mildly convincing
one last time... I wish I could short with my account
Afaik NKLA lock period is over on Dec 1. Then nearly everyone can sell. Trevor will definitely sell a big stake because they threw him out.
pikachu.jpg
Bullish - more equity for NKLA ;)
The thing about my medallion, is that it's located on my cock.
TL;DR F
Going to zero and then GM will either retain the IP (if it exists)
fucking jesus
Get Plaid model S
This is my goal. 1, 2, or 3 motors?
Bot
Just keep building silently my man. Itll moon soon enough
Because there new phone is a iPhone 5 with 3 cameras
Literally no momentum to go any higher than a 2T market cap
100 day moving average is at $28.81 and it's riding it like a charm...

People thinking theyll literally get rich off GameStop today lol
Me too :(
Didnt you hear the news? Biden hurt his ankle
Proudly
Yes. Waiting for that one day.
CRSR needs to check itself
For free?
Feel that
never.
How long is this squeeze supposed to go?
Bitch needs to stay in her lane..plastic Barbie headass
Man I sold my puts that were being eaten alive by theta gang. I didnt feel good about the pump but..
We good
Which THC? There are like 5 versions of it.
Story of my life. SOL not out of solar sustem
FOMOs like me or call holders
I'm holding a call down 50 percent. Like fuck am I voluntarily taking the loss. Happy to see what tomorrow looks like. Or even this afternoon.
12/11 $40c BagHolder reporting sir!
Never fucking left
What did u buy
Stupid fuckers need to learn to hold.
It is every other comment just now everyones sad about how much money they've lost
Thank god
Wiped out 95% of my fucking profits
legit made me laugh
What happened with you bro?
Dont sell
How much ? And what were your positions
lol give up
Nice! I"m at -7% had rolled some contracts out and up, down and up. Just waiting for people to come to their senses
You are the epitome of retarded.
never again...I held on to calls one time hoping for a recovery and than it bled more. Sometimes you got to cut losses
Retard power bought the dip at 24.
i dunno man. just go over to r/politics and say you think trump is smart, then go to r/trump and say AOC is hot
Yup
Its hitting 25 this week, 45+ within the next 1-2 months.
Ya we sure as hell not working fuck else we gonna do
strong bubble indicator
LOL know that feeling all too well today
They probably already profited and covered the first time
I hope Left files for bankruptcy
Who's going to print the t-shirts?
New sub t-shirt
who told you
Never sell tesla
Sorry mate. So glad I didnt pull that trigger
 too fucking accurate.
i was promised tendies
Honestly if you buy Jan 15th contract to later you should be fine. Its just retards here can only afford the weeklies
"Guys, if we buy and hold enough GME, this is our greatest opportunity to trigger a squeeze ever over the course of the next few weeks"

"It'S NoT MoOnIng DaY 1 WaT HapPeN"
YES
Try to  your Dick.
I did buy it friday morning, but at least didnt sell it yet
that would require talent
seriously what a day
High five
All day.
There's still earnings coming up. It's probably going to take a considerable hit after they are announced.
If PLTR can just go fucking up so I can get out and buy game share I'd be happy
You need to stop and go do something else. Shouldnt be buying and selling so quickly for no profit.

Stop being retarteded, and have diamond hands
Craziest part is spelling panic with a K at the end
So you're all in on PLTR?
Never, Santa is gonna come and take us to the north pole
the play with GME wasn't a normal WSB pump, if anything happens it'll likely be later this week or after the earnings report next Tuesday night.
You could have bought today also.
Damn bro I know youre fucked cause I waited to close on Friday to get in and my calls are down 80% anyway
 pltr was a scam 
Bought calls today. Lets hope so
Consoles gave it a nice boost which spooked some shorts who covered, which spooks more shorts to cover.  This will go on for a bit.
thats why we all buying when it goes public
Its no joke, and you got parents who will but their kids robux out the wazoo
Clash of clans
its the real deal.  crack to kids
Awful financials, theyre losing money in a year that kids r being forced to stay inside
what ticker is that?
Loaded up with 250 shares just patiently waiting for it to hit 20$ 

will it drop tommorow ??
My math says a decrease of 2,562%
12/11 $10 pooots bb
Please tell me it's going down...I need it to lol
nobody buying that pump and dump dawg
Better buy quick it doesn't look like it is going to dip
Still a lot of room to run here. With momentum it could close above $10 easy this week.
Well when all you have left is pennies.
SUNDIAL got me from 6 to midnight.. yes my portfolio too
No, it is forbidden here



we're making money. 

some dipshits don't like making money on a sub called WallStreetBets

do my math for me, it's hard! 

400K shares @ .27 cents 3 weeks ago = how many shares @ .75 cents today
Im doing my part. Just bought 100 shares. Lets gooo
Finally 
Someone who gets me
i don't think you know what an average cost is, when referring to 1 share.

:D
I sold to buy NKLA puts. Waiting for the Citron bullshit to be over with, and if I'm going to be bearish I'd like to be bearish on a fake company.
This is the way.
GAAAANG
Right there with you.  Let's get this money.
It will give it time
I've seen toy story 3 so I know the bear can be defeated
I bought another $3500 just now. Doing my small part.
Bear cucks
I dont understand why everyone sells low haha
Everytime lol.. let the winners win
when's earnings?
Either way, I'm an autist and I'm on board
does this affect its price? going up? or going parabloic?
  
  
So we've gone PLTR to GME to APHA. Am I missing some?
jezus, uhhhhh is the split actually being announed or somn?
You'll be able to exchange shares for some Halo socks
Exactly. If we get a rally eod and that momentum can continue we could see 25+ by earnings.
Slowly but surely 
Yeah lol we can do better, and if not I lose confidence in wsb
Somebody's Watching Me

Paranoid

Every breath you take

Private Eyes

Hey there Delilah.
$35C 2/19 is the last option im holding. Panic sold most of them, still profiting over the last 2 weeks, but at significantly less profit. Rolled over most of my option equity into shares and selling covered calls
i'm pretty much all in bro, and I bought more today
i think its gonna take at least 4 days, but im going to hold
Only holding shares for now
We've just been given the chance to buy in at a lower price.
Yea its still up 8%. Still shorted 130%. Just big money trying to scare. Lotta moves will happen after hours/pre market
I bought at 19.3
Yes pussy
Only if you like money
Dang, some hedge fund  hire this mf. Ez 100 baggers  
you do realize this company cannot grow going forward right? acquisition maybe. Their business model is outdated and trash, especially with the rotation to PC gaming for many former console gamers where everything is digital
Flatline is pretty op in Apex legends
Just let it rest bro, Im also holding calls but I rather have it consolidating today than running up just to sell off first thing tomorrow. We have the whole week to run up lol
STRAP ON
Its consolidating were still on course. 
Don't even sweat, it big dog. I have 70k on them and I will be fine if I lose.

I want to get in but I'm sweating too. What did you buy?
Man ive been holding since 9:40...
oh fer sure bud, you betcha
my calls could use some pump
The stress is unreal
Shcoin basically scalped all the follicles off my head already. I guess wrinkling up is the next big thing?
has to be. but if u hit u gets $$. n rich people live longer. The US working class is actually losing life expectancy...so it would behoove u to become a multimillionaire via meme fd's as fast as u can
I'm going for broke man. $30c 1/8/21 20 contracts
I bought at the peak fml 
yummmyyyy
CSPs at $25 did me well
Fr. I sold $40 calls this morning for 1k and they dropped to 500 so I cashed out lol

If the fucking stock would go up that'd be nice too
Yep. They are my only calls that are printing today.
Stop trying to make APHA happen

[deleted]
Stay strong  
Because you love money
Yup. Made a bunch then lost it. I'm done with it for now.
lmao
Shhhhhhhh
I literally sold my 660 for 3 720s for the sole reason that this will run AH and cause FOMO tomorrow.
Best day I've had in a while
Because smooth brain boi
Stocks do be like that
ill take 26.99 Bob
Yup. Every day.
Thank you for articulating this for the cowards to understand
The paper hands will ruin the squeeze
Plus all the options.... for once we were just supposed to buy shares
STOP THE DROP!!

Not before GME.
This is music to my fucking ears Im loaded to the tits on pltr and nio. 96% nio and 4% pltr weeklies basically
GME & PLTR no weekly
probably citron employees... fuck off homos
EOW estimate?
Mods
It is glass or wood? There is a difference.
Mods
I cant believe the weeeak ass hands that WSB traders seem to have. This is healthy, & consolidating at $27 just gives us a new launching pad next news.
This right here. 

I sold puts on Friday and they are way up (I.e. the bears are losing money right now). Volatility is going down = Calls are on sale. 

Load up on calls and make the MM pump it to hedge.
PLTR will deliver us to the tendies my friend!
You kidding? This is a very healthy uptick.
Last time I checked green is good
Cant complain it went from 26 to 28.70. Soon as market opens up 
Im bullish for the next year but Im expecting a dump at open..and a slow March up to end the day around $26 to close in the red like Friday. This thing rose way too quickly. 28-30 EoY.
Just woke up? We good dude with PLTR dude?!
Send some out to us baba call holders too
It still will
Youre retarded but not in a good way
Yep, they just played a big role in diversifying my portfolio.

DKNG and GME shares.
Same LETS GO
If you arent growing +20% each day, are you really growing at all!?!?
Key word thought
On Friday when options expire
Friday after a 300% run-up.
Hes just a lil lost give him a moment
Buenos tardes
Soup?
Almost 3x avg PM vol.

It's making big moves today.
Bunch of idiots gonna get cucked fomoing in.
the short sellers wont go down without a fight. diamod hands are required
Pretty funny. I was like. Hey I'm up $700 this morning. Neat.  Then I get to work. Oh..ok.
Very brave. Wouldnt rly do that at open tho, wait until it sinks a bit.
Why haven't you already?
Man this thing is running up nicely
Shhhhhh
Jumping on this train today
And its little bro $fubo
EOW
more like 800
Then Elon announces another stock split to bring us to 1200
Hot, you little slut! Take my green dildo up your positions!
PLTR has an end game?
Same boat with 30c 12/18 as well
I have the same call. Hoping it all works out for the both of us
wake up at 7:30, work from 8-5. gets dark at 5. cant do anything outside bc its dark. 

who invented this shit. keep it dark outside until 10am idgaf.
Yes, but I'm going to be cautious about my bear plays. Might be too crowded.
I see bankruptcy, but the lies will probably keep them alive for a few more years.
Thats sort of the nature of the daily thread. I used to post good mini DD (like, coincidentally on PLTR when it was sub 10) and got no play. Now I just bitch about NKLA
Did you try mentioning PLTR
Go back to r/investing
Lulz. Might be too late for puts on open if it dumps pre.
GME may pop in the short term but the real catalyst for the squeeze will be sometime between now and march which is their q4 ER
just got in rn feels bad. APHA stock or calls
Should i place them at open?
Agreed
Called it last week.  Sell/short NKLA like crazy.
Fuck yeah! FDB
I think her boyfriend wouldn't mind
TSLA  just wants to be friends.
I totally thought the stock offering was a joke. Is the price $5 a share?
Ponzi
Lmfao i purchased so many puts. I believed hidenburg research was legit
Told you retards to buy the dip
19200 wtf
9:30 - dip
10:30 - pump
I am sure a lot of you boys are both
Downsies for the first hours then upsies for to flat for the rest of the day
This is the way
Why sit in the car and not inside SBX
Why only 3 hours?
#CUT THE SHIT
ath is 93 wow... but you can say that about anything like buying Apple for 130 lol
Glad you are making tendies off that scamming cuck.
is there a specific reason it's going to the moon today? News in Germany?
Apex also
A big fat rolling ball of cash
Wait. You'll either gain back some of those losses, or you'll get fucked harder. Win/win
We good dog.
12/24, but i'll join you
I'm squeezing one out rn.  Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, thats why I shit on company time:)
Who bought what
Finally
Or Ban ?
never
Friday
I would've been worried about those
Lmao Godspeed brother

PLTR

NOW 
Now or never...I only dumped 10k- feeling like a loser

Get in now 
GET IN NOWWWW 
Youre gonna have to hibernate 
the hero we needed
Gme stocks for the squeeze
For what exp?? If it's 12/31 or after I say fuck yeah
When?
They wont, theyre dumb but not dumb enough to short a company thats already 100% short
Don't forget about my boy PLTR
Got 100 at 18.70
EOW estimate?

And in such little time
GME
Poor people are dumb
Thanks didn't see those
Right.  My whole page is blood red even stocks I don't have
APHA
APHA is the way to go.
That's the correct assessment. APHA.
Apha hands down!
When did you buy?
big brain move is selling puts while meming your way to the top
But what stock?
brb crying
this is the way
F
Greed is good haha. Assuming you mean tsla. I been there. I sold at open today doe
Shares gang 
I am holding too. Trust the process 
Sir, this is a casino.

Options, options as far as the eye can see.
yes
Nah dog. This is weed stocks week. Didnt you get the WSB wide memo?
Have the first two. Praying for more in the next week or two when their mergers are closer.
sold 1/3 of planatir. my concience bothering me
ME NEITHER HERE FOR A GOOD TIME
I am

A week or so isn't forever
He do be right
Better to just close your eyes for some more rather than pull out
For real, one red day and bears think they can fuck again.
Opec, nkla and covid.
Down 4K now
Unfortunately
Ez
Did that and now its still going down ... fml
i am contemplating selling. or buying more
Just wait ill the final minute for the 99% off sale!!!!
how soon will it be back to 30
On god
Thank you for your service
This is a good time to buy PLTR if youre bullish
same. I was this close to selling, but I realized almost all my money I lost this year was because of panic selling at the lowest. I gotta find some way to make me not care about the red days
Amen! If all of the market is crashing then its not as scary. If only your meme stock is crashing then we got an issue
Not until you and the margin call guy at your broker are on a first name basis, lets fuckin go
Now we hold.
far from it
I doubled my position at $17.50 and not really upset either
NIO meme took months to build up after seeing strong rises in May-June-July. IF PLTR looks similar, we can expect $100 in 4-5 months.
classy, not too tight
IM NOT FUCKING SELLING.
<>
Fucking ibrk is down
Same. Got some May 21 and Jan 22 I bought when it was $9/share 
you making calls?
Im in balls deep my friend
yeah why not, fuck it
Big guys buy up shit or sell off right before and after lunch depending on how the day goes. 11-1 things slow when they're out to lunch. Since we had a big sell off, I'm predicting they're going to buy a bit before lunch and then buy more when they come back
I just had butt fuk with ye ma
They all did to buy fucking GameStop while citron scooped up cheap PLTR lol this sub has the memory of a goldfish
You dont belong here
Hey look its me!
Lmao
Mid day * mutha fucka
I was away from my computer for ten minutes and missed the dip and recovery. End me.
Amen to that! 
There was a lot of caffeine behind this post.

Dipped red just long enough to trigger my trailing stop loss 
puke and rally is the only way to go
Second wind!!!!
was never gonna happen today, might happen anywhere in the lead up to/ after the 12/8 earnings report. Cohen might just trigger it himself.

By buying APHA, its a weed stock and weed is green. Green means monies go put your tuition down on APHA unless you hate money and America
Shitty as it sounds, time. It'll hurt for a bit for sure but use the time to focus on you, maybe reach out to some friends take your mind off things. Definitely try and treat yourself. You could always YOLO a bunch of calls and get rich then who even needs them. If the calls don't pan out at least you'll be worried about money instead of the ex

Last day of the month, and we're almost to December. Volatility is going to drop off of a cliff and make options lose value. Anything you're thinking of bailing on before the end of the year should happen in the next 10 days.
Lunch time
This is the truth
Just bought Leaps on that dip today.
If it stay below $31 by EOW, i'd send you some ropes  
but the question is are we insane?
I wish I was this retarded and had this much money to blow
You're going to be a fucking millionaire bro
Why would it pop? Seriously why are people buying weed? I thought that shit was dead
Next month? this sub is for goldfish trading... the second you are in and the one you just left... only things remembered or factored... 

but I do see it over 100 within 2 years.
Haha was thinking same shit , bad weather= bad mood. If its better tomorrow = Green Day
AGREED.
I already bought 100 shares.
It's about time.
now is the time to get in
Wow not a single ticker other than maybe GoodRx hasn't been or currently is a meme on WSB.
Whats crsr
This should tell us all something
and Fisker and Clean Spark and Snap and Twitter...etc
F
I'm thinking on it, what did you buy?
LEAPED.
Shouldve done it earlier today when the cyber Monday sale was on. Never doubt the RGB dons
buying every dip, 20k in shares cost averaged up from IPO to 29 per share and 5k in 40c 1/15s
you will be rewarded
Yikes...
lol i have 31k
Not that Jeff

Either way it's bullish as fuk

Lul that was some real BS. I ain't gonna lie it had me shook in march. I believed that shit like it was Y2k.
i believed that shit so much i yolod 8k in 1hr expiration $3 otm calls
I have one. It's ridiculously fast and the battery lasts a week. Highly recommended
Yeah it's unbeatable for the price for most people. Incredible single core for daily tasks and good enough multi ore. Graphics a bit better than 1050ti which won't run demanding games but still amazing for igpu. All that using only 10-15w for 15hr battery life. 

If you need 2 monitors, play games, or need bootcamp I wouldn't get it. Otherwise it's great for most people.
I'm gonna wait for the M2.
Curious as well
Marques Brownlee did a great review on it
dunno bout macbrokes but im gonna scoop me up a mac mini i think

Never doubt the kingpin meme stock
Its gonna be nice
Same. Its been fun skimming free shares but Im exiting my options tomorrow at open and staying out until it stops crabbing
IV crush already semi happened. If tomorrow is flat then maybe youll see a large drop again, but not that much price movement other than the past 3 hours seems to show it will go much much lower.
Dont worry. Trevor Milton gets to start selling his founders shares on Dec 3. Share dilution incoming
Its all the people who bought at the top holding on for dear life
Its gonna take more than .14% to get me to rise up

Just get to $40 at least and stay at $40
Everyone who got in today at open when it was up like 17%

As long as you bought today during regular trading hours u are losing money.
9% 
Refueling 
Hell yeah
im praying it doesnt go any lower
Loss porn. Go.
This isn't the squeeze.
I was just as surprised wtf. Wsb right again??
We don't know yet if It is squeezing le just pumping, GNE last months usually pump a lot and dump a lot
not yet, just an upward move.  when it squeezes the story shall be epic.
It's inevitable at this point tbh

holding, sir!
This is the way.
Copy that sir!
Proof or ban
From you?!
From you orrrr?
Mf's see the dip after the market opened less than an hour ago and go "Hmmm idk man I'm pulling out"
I think you have to grab her by the pussy!
Buy PLTR from people who are selling. That would solve the problem 
Grab her by her mudflaps
Buy her a PTON

Buy her some Tory Burch, Gucci, lulu whatever with some flowers and write a note 
Ditto but will prob sell covered calls on it haha
We on GME now bag holder
its all bout the tsla
I would have bought an M3 If they had not been retarded and added Android Auto sooner.
I mean the $200,000 - $300,000 ones I've seen are pretty cool. But yeah the standard models I agree.
Idk man, M3 all my dream car, absolute beast
Lol. 40$ eow with autist army
Yes everybody set your GME limit sell for 69.69 it will trigger short squeeze
Yes. Fuck that family time bullshit, its tendie time motherfucker
Prolly should ask my boss if I can work Sat and Sun, so I can take off Mon and Fri...
 
Hell yea. To the moon baby
That should mean more pressure on the buy end. They aren't gonna sell...
This is a new one to me. Is there a DD or semi DD on it?

Smart play

Makes $14:  
    
My only regret is I didnt load more 12/24 10c last week when they were under .20 a contract. Still cheap right now honestly, but could have been a massive win. Averaged up on them today.
Can confirm.  ACB/HEXO gang mooning
Crazy down? Crazy up? Looks like downsies.

TD Amertrade AH fills are horrible.  Even during market hours they are not that much better than RH.  Makes me fuckign wonder why I have pay a commission to see my order disappear into the fucking dark pool just RH.

I have Buffy blanket and sheets made from Eucalyptus and that shit is the truth. I bet my wife probably spent 8k altogether on our bed and pillows and shit. I sleep like a damn baby though.
Michael Burry says get a weighted blanket, and autism makes money. Retards lose it.
Is it a purple blanket?
Hell, no you haven't.  We need you on this train.
Yeah same, was hard to get behind GameStop especially when they offer jack shit for game trades
Anyone that didnt see this coming is an actual retard the whole fucking company is a joke

Read Born to Run great book
Your shoes are probably the wrong type.  
I've got a collapsed arch, so if I don't wear sneakers with a really hard sole, I get similar problems.
Is your foot flat? Good shoes might not be stylish persay but you will thank them if you wear them
Answer is not more cushioning. You need to learn proper mid foot strike and shorter low impact stride. I retrained my foot by running barefoot style using vibram and running sandals.

PLTR will help you buy foot surgery if your shit is still fucked up in middle age.
Ultraboosts
No sole running shoes. Will learn to run on the balls of your feet. First few times you calves will be sore as hell but joint/back aches from impact will be a ting of the past. Im 40 started using them at 35 completely changed how I run.
Lose weight if you are over. If you are heavy thats a lot of shock on your knees and feet.
Barefoot style / minimalist running shoes solved my shin splints and knee pain - I think cause they force you to run on your forefoot/mid foot not your heels. No idea if that could solve your problems
Are they good shoes? Try Salomon or Brooks. You probably have plantar fasciitis, pretty common.
if you're landing on the heel in your stride, that could be causing it. I had knee issues and switched to zero drop minimalist shoes (think CrossFit  style shoes) for running and it made a huge diff. It does change your stride a little and there is a bit of a break-in period.
Go see a physical therapist. Look for an orthopedic clinical specialist (OCS) (this is not a ticker).

I bought at peak LMAO my deposit hit as it was peaking
Calls? Theta going to eat you up
Youll be fine. Itll climb back
Bruh relax. It's only down 3% from an all time high

I miss a week and a half ago where it was a green bouncy ball going up for the day
shit broke my heart after the 3rd day
No its dead bruh stop listening to these fuckheads
Yea
Not with that IV
Lol.
I bought a block at 17.70, and at peak after open, sold a 20c expiring Friday for $240. I win either way.
If we go down 5% more this week, I wouldnt be surprised. But like limit down futures, CB crash aint it
Bears won't be hibernating this winter ig
dont worry
holding or cutting losses?
VIX
Yeah I bought puts this morning that expire this Friday literally at the peak today and I'm only up 30%. Can't complain too much but calls and a 15% upwards movement would be like 100% gain...
lfm bagholders
Reiterated- option premium too damn high. Just get the shares, watch tendies come your way this week.
Why shares and not a long call? I got a $20c for 4/16 when it was like $13 and its lookin good. 

Im also a noob, so just want to gain any insight I can. I should hold onto it until April right? Or at this rate, sell it and get a higher C?
Not yet. We need to go up more!
Sold thiccbee and up she goes
wrong
Yeah, last week was a total FOMO...
[deleted]
autism achieved
Alrdy broke

All stocks are dead.
Ditto, only down 2% of my total portfolio
exactly the same p/l :0
Same, I was peak -35k loss today when TSLA was at 555 and PLTR at 24. Looks like we are starting to recover though.
RISE UP BROTHER! I ALMOST SHIT MYSELF BUT WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS  THE STRONG SHALL BE REWARDED
same. how long are you holding till?
see you tomorrow
You need to zoom out to a 5 minute or 30 minute chart my dude. Being on the 1 minute chart on an index is only if you are scalp trading
Inverse your own thoughts $$$
first time?
I just do shares. Ill take my 30-75% gains of active management.
Might be a bull trap
Sounds like [you're BOGGED m8.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5QlSgq7lg)
Lil bitch always blaming everything but yourself. Classic morning dip, nothing else. Just fucking hold you wank
I bought at 18+ lol. Then it down to 17
this is the way.
exactly, this is going to be insane
That ship sailed last week, chief
Diamond hands will be rewarded. Paper hands will stay poor.
Exactly
Most idiots speculating on the market don't 'like' the company in the sense of doing research and understanding the companies they're buying shares of inside out. People buy based on momentum and then panic when that momentum reverses
Thank you for your sacrifice
I was a bear from January through May. made a ton of money and lost it all doubling down on more red.
40% here! Never doubted my sweet child
\+ GM
I had a stop sell at 24.30. cancelled it just in time (hopefully a good decision)
I was so close to almost pulling out at 24.3   Not gonna happen again
Gme
I would just got PLTR, thats the hot stock rn here, and GME, PLTR will be $40 soon enough
r m g
Youre pretty much GME or PLTR for the crazy 10-20% swings

If this most recent market has shown us anything, its that it doesnt give two fucks about the economy, so no shame.
Youre right, thats not asking for much

Everyone knows gamestop will go out of business... That's what's causing the short squeeze.
as it's down 0.80% nice
Drilling like a bitch
making money on a red day is still sexy times
Patience
Literally never buy puts
more people=more demand=more production.

stocks will go up until 2070 when the population peaks and starts declining, but even so it will keep going up cause poor people will convert into middle class=demanding more products and buying more
A low cap stock that's easily manipulated by short selling is probably not the best play this month!

It is a decent one though
But its too high up today. Will wait for a dip
Need a bigger slide
I got the same feeling. Itll be a good 2% pump whenever it happens
Canuck stim today.
Sell before the house vote for safety. Sell after the house vote if you're a gambler. Sell after the senate vote if you want to lose your money.
Its gme tard
lets hope we didnt buy at the top
the Q is if she's a hot becky or a bitchy karen who has overstayed her welcome
IV too high
Youll lose everything
Bought a few shares of BABA a couple weeks back and up like 0.5% on them.. do I dump them on move on? Theyre so undervalued rn but man theyre pissing me off
Your jacked to the tits after being down $40k?
down 2k being up 6k.
sell some covered calls at $17, $18, whatever and lock in some profits
GG
It's fine if you're up a good amount and place a stop to protect your gains.
Set it conditional to stock price.
It paid off for Elon in the long run
All my homies hate the SEC
Its three day trades in a week and its to protect brokers from our autism
lol the fuck?

just dont be poor and have 25k.

(or use a cash account)
Right? Fuck us
???
only poor americans
They dont care about us enough to hate us. They just want to keep us out of the way and 3 day trades a week helps accomplish that. Make it hard to move up in the world so they can keep the poors out of sight and out of mind
Basically it guarantees they control the flow of the market, despite robinhooders, wallstreetbetters, etc. all memeing buying shares/options.  If everyone had uncontrolled spending with margin and no 25k limit, we would fuck their algorhthms into oblivion and a lot of sorry people would be broke pretty quickly.

But I'm with you, it sucks and is stupid.
I got perma-banned for challenging them once...
Yes
They made a pltr forum

Winters dont exist anymore

I 'member when I was a kid, every year like clockwork snow would come and we'd all be fucking around in it happy as fuck

Must be fucking depressing being a kid on winters these days
True no snow here at all yet tf
Have both in my IRA. Been riding ICLN calls in my gambling account for months and it's the little engine that could. TAN is my fucking baby tho, heavy exposure to ENPH and JKS and some other usual suspects in solar. Just loaded the fuck up on 95c 1/15 this morning.
no it won't. this is a clear red day with too much downside momentum. just hoping it doesn't turn into a multi-day trend.
Holy fuck that red dick lol I was just about to buy at the top
it was hyped a few months ago
Unless it's priced in
I got in 630c 12/4 this morning and Im down about 20% she needs to wake the fuck up
It already did. The whole month.
I would say try waiting till before the last hour of the day. Tomorrow onwards should be green though so make sure u get in today.
tbh i think its gonna be atleast 35 eoy so im reentering
Yeah I think so
Looks like its consolidating. I think it has support at $26.
a portfolio consisting of NIO, TSLA, PLTR, AMD and CRSR
You diversify strike price and expiration date . It's the Warren buffet way. Duh
This is what usually happens. Not falling for it
You thinking this morning's dip was to test the waters and gauged reaction?
APHA
APHA. Much stronger position!
APHA for a more solid company but less movement, ACB as a retard strength pennystock in disguise that can leave you holding heavy bags.
Both
She gonna move bigly at EOD - either direction hahaha. But should be significant either way IMO.
$30 is very reasonable. It depends on your risk tolerance.
Ok.. your option is OTM.   The only value now is time value and volatility.   $28 doesnt matter unless vol spikes.
Consolidating power
12/11 25p buy the dip

Too high of short interest I would think. May tweet about it though
How would that even be possible
That's basically a hate crime.
Lolll should have known this would die OG LOKE
Youre just gifting someone $220.
amzn disagree
Nigga do u know how to wait
False start..trying again at 3:00.
Shit! Robinhoods options don't go that high.
Take it and run 
I sold bro I said fuck it and take the money before power hour hits
US is fucked. Clinton's drubbing of Gingrich Republicans, the last group who wanted to control public spending, has borne one evil fruit after another including forever wars and a financial crisis. And politicians seem to rhink that more of the poison will cure it.. You see, in our monetary system, government deficit spending crowds out private economic growth. Because the FED cannot actually print money.
Easy! Might be a 10 bagger by EOY
what price?
I was up $900, down $2500 now only down $600
Yeeeeezzzurr
take profits?
Holding is less than taxes!
Hire donnies tax accountant?
see...saving on taxes...smrt
The tax rate for short term capital gains of this size is 37% iirc and that amounts to 666,000.

If you hold for at least one year, the max is 20%, which is 360,000.

The saving is ~300,000.
Source? Not bc I don't believe you but bc I want to read about it and laugh
Not bad for those that sold CC.
I sold puts. Quite comfortable right now.
Dont forget about my boi vega too
Put premiums are juicy tho!! easy 10% return on cash
>Would like a final hour run up for PLTR but tbh its probably just gonna stay at 27

there's a lot of nervous call holders atm
it's a win and win
The cirrrrcleee of liiiifffffeeee
 please CRSR 
Dont they sell keyboards too?
Its not even dipping that much though.
meteorites become red hot when they plunge through the atmosphere and degrade.
Red hot at $60-70 a share, also red hot at $20 a share

Imagine finally jumping in when it's trading sideways 
Ima look them right in the face and tell them to come clean up afterwards. PLTR is a given. One announcement of the tracing and were pushing light speed
at white price u calling?
The $120 wall was harder tho, that shit had 400k shares
Not if holding shares since 10.50 
I already bought during the sales, what more do you want from me???
Not really lol
Why would flatline be good/mean big boys are loading up?
PLTR
Almost went full cash when I saw that lol
I don't really know what you guys expect buying companies with never before seen market caps after massive run ups.
Got 7k riding on TSLA and SPY FDs. Going to be a very interesting after hours for me

does not want to go over 8.40. We need to poke it with a stick or something.
Start with loss aversion
Ya my calls went green the more it went down...IV cummin
They just got approval to add a huge section to the German factory
We mooning after close into tomorrow
Youre not an idiot then congratz
u know earning is only for the quarter ended oct.? Soooo what kinda earnings do u expect? they wont even have ps5 or xbox sales 
Strikes?
stick with it all the way to the bread line. Youre not a true retard unless you lose so hard you owe your broker a few million$
:(
This is why I love WSB.  Here I am feeling bad about a -5% day.  I had a chance to end up 2% too, but blew it.
Don't worry, man. Tomorrow you'll be laughing at yourself for sweating about this weak shakeout. We're going to see Mars tomorrow.
you watched all day just to buy it the last 15 minutes?
NIO, BLNK, XPEV, and PLTR to the moon! 
PLTR 30 in PM
I hope so
Only if it gets to 9$ by next week. Otherwise small peen alert everywhere.
I'm just glad I'm holding shares and not calls....

>Now more than ever we MUST diamond hand this bitch



Algos that browse this thread must read shit like this and start doing whatever the algorithmic equivalent of salivating is
Leggo
We are here, dont worry
Bought some shares and calls on Friday. Raised guidance this morning hoping it pops to 50+ by end of week
Still
Diamond hand this ine
Crying in the car but wiping my tears with my diamond hands.
Careful with the blow my man
YOOOO!
REPOrTING
are you not watching what i'm watching? low volume and tanking after ever pump.... this thing is going to break 27 and freefall again 

&#x200B;

sell and get in cheaper
Need more people to buy and break resistance at 27
The order book says otherwise
Coin flip
lol delusional
to be fair, a 20% swing is tough.. I am diamond hands, but I thought about it!

Gl Im rooting for you and all of us
This is the way
Thats it fam
Please don't tell me you bought NKLA calls.
see you tomorrow my dude
if you were long on NKLA, you deserve to go bankrupt..
If you were bullish on Nkla then you deserve 0 in your account
? Everyones been saying that company is trash and to buy puts where were you?
How bad was it?
Honestly if you were invested in NKLA (anything other than puts) you probably should be done. I'm sorry you lost money though.
AAPL shares are the move.

Any gains I make from yolos Im just stuffing into tech shares
AAPL has been so good to us this year, and that is how you treat it?
Aapl is easy money lol
Yea
Maybe an alien project
yeah buddy gonna start asking NPCs for side quests

[deleted]
Never heard of it
We all are.
Already grabbed my seats. Moon time.
YESSIR
Its doing the opposite of rising lollll
 
I bought at 32$ haha
So youre saying YOLO my savings on PLTR calls.
Your gonna have to elaborate on the pilot fish one

How come people play weeklies if Theta is so bad ?
this is what everyone said last week and look how that ended
My guy
Sold at 31 on Friday and now just enjoying the show.
Give this man an award!!
There's no justice until Trevor sits in a cell.
lol you were banking on that GM deal I assume?
tell us about your Nikola story
Its fine to say you called it, but to put someone down and tell them you shouldve listened to me is definitely a bitch move. 

Sometimes I call something, but dont have a lot to throw at it. Im never 100% certain in my guesses, but I will usually throw SOME money at it. Its more of an estimated guess imo
Refer to VW 2008 infinity squeeze for some context of what it could look like
13% is not a short squeeze cmon man
Do you think buying at open i a good Strat?
This is not a squeeze. A squeeze you'll see a green dildo the distance from earth to moon. This is only to mount everest
Sold, Palbro. The IV and theta is too high.
You\`re on ur own now son
<----- Slow claps
Just took viagra. Its gonna go upppppp
It's heading to the moon.
It is currently up 3%
Its gonna make half this sub even more poor than they already were.
Thatd be cool
I just called 34 
Commenting to save and hopefully not call you a retard
Lol humans control the news to push narrative
Vaccine news that gets recycled every week - its hilarious - they need a headline to justify the algos and all of us buying everything we can so they just make it up now lol
I hadn't seen this, appreciate it.
So reactionary
lmfao thats what im sitting here contemplating
If you don't buy 18 now you'll be buying 20 later.
Lmao, this thought fucking passed my mind. Guess we in FOMO territory now.
A ton of it too
Bought 56 shares
Same dilemma here lol
Half of it is newbs asking when the market open etc. we are not back
If it gaps to 35 Im Audi
$35 to $250 in an hour damn 
Knew I shouldnt have doubled down. Smooth brain move :/
Pls pls pls

Keep it up. Im closing my eyes until tomorrow
This is the way
yessir
Elon put a fucking rocket in my pants. This stock and this dick are going to fucking Mars.
Hold and buy more every dip. This shit too sexy.
Bullish AF
FULLISH
I stopped caring about things like "fundamentals" and "profit" and "sustainable business model" and "does this company even actually exist" about six months ago and have made an absolute killing ever since.
Not sure why i found this funny...but it made me crack up
Lmao what fade its up 14%
People read way too much into premarket open movement. It's rarely going to hold those levels up or down.
Fuck there go my calls
Nah
Yeah
100%
Just came out bro,

Moderna: Vaccine Efficacy Against COVID-19 Was 94.1%; Vaccine Efficacy Against Severe COVID-19 Was 100% 
$MRNA
The comment below yours is a vaccine update haha.
me at $19 :(
i think we all know the answer to that one bud
Jump ship before WSB. These guys ride hype trains to the bottom
Pretty much PSTH for me. The idea is solid and although I don't understand this pump and think if it's on hopes of a stripe deal then it will drop again. It's my one long term hold
Tesla forever!!
Pretty loyal to tesla for time being. Else we husslin over here.
ABBV has been a good play for a while now
Amzn, msft, aapl, ba, rtx, cvx, jpm, v , sbux
Thank you
Man, i cant fucking relate more.
Im thinking Pfizer might be a undervalued move though, everyone has a boner for MRNA cause its Dollys
Bruh Tesla been doiin for a solid week. I regret not buying *more* calls
TSLA over 600 to start the week would be amazing.
P!!!!

The vaccine news dropping on Monday was riced in
Sir this is a truck stop casino!
Fourth Monday morning vaccine news in four weeks. The manipulation doesn't work anymore. Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, now Moderna again? Sorry, old news.
because vaccine pumps dont work any more. it is bear time.
F
This is the way
literally cant go down with all the coming vaccine pump.

Portfolio
There's shares too, you know. Imagine them as endlessly dated 1x leveraged options.
Buy shares, fuck shorts.
Why didnt you jump in like a month ago? Do you like bag holding?
either way youre buying today
I never buy such volatile stocks in the morning. There is usually a dump......pltr has been stabilizing around 11-1, sometimes it starts mooning after 1 tho.  Generally I buy between 2-3.
Wait for a while I guess, but just fucking buy it. Better to buy it at 30 than when it reaches 100.
Do it...or dont. 


You might love it...or you might wont.


You might be rich...or you might be broke.
DCA in
Premarket if you can is better
Wait til EoD, will be testing $23 by lunch
No shit. The idea is to ride the wave
Old Buzz Killington to the fucking rescue.
True but it's good in the short term. ACB has the dumb meme energy but the company sucks. Works good for momentum calls and puts.
dumb money out there to burn. smoke em if you got em
so no point buying $APHA non-expiring calls? (stock)
$50 easy
30 atleast
Yes
arent they still red
imagine buying NKLA
you mean 29?
I need it to go the other way best of luck, have some silver.
Absolutely. $10P, maybe lower.
I would not be surprised
My 12/18 $23 calls are happy
I took a long call into JULY.
Im in ICLN for the long run, its on a tear right now.
Honestly thinking of selling at open and buying back in later
The week and monthly chart don't support buying on a gain like this
And 5 years from now Ill still be buying calls at all time highs....shit never changes
I bought puts on nkla last week.  Blood bath coming
price and dates?
Dang, sorry
ouch!  Vaccine plays are so tough to negotiate though...
Its waiting for the bitches to show up at open and then its gonna 
Mine were down 90% really hope they finally pay out
Him and that Theranos bitch are gonna do a Jeff\\Jizzlane deal.
um for  what?
Just keep averaging down. It's day will come.
Yes!
Make sure you long them. But yes.
When used against my enemy, these are wise words
Puts or short position at open is the play today
Cuz  r fuk
Its not. Only WSB holdings are up
Because next years gonna be better than the last. Good news abound
How do you know me? Is this Bob, from the mens room?????
lol I remember that story
GME your 10k will be 100k
GME / PLTR dec calls

PINS / ETSY / DKNG / PTON jan to april calls
PLTR Jan 2021 calls.
GME stocks. All in

Mine stays dark
Daddy Ackman rules - SPAC up nearly 40% without a deal announcement!
Selling some NVDA to ride this wave. NVDAs been so flat lately while TSLA has skyrocketed $150 in the same time frame.

Wondering the same thing. Might not be if a squeeze happens shares could easily hit 25-30$
30 by EOW so probably not
Not by a long shot
No
Only calls can make me money
tendies steaming
Yes
This is the way
makes sense, easy profits
Of course
Please dont
how old are you
No you moron. Diversify. 

Draftkings is the meme stock here with the clearest path the massive growth, it has giant brand recognition and will be fast to market in every state to legalize sports betting. Buy their shares or leaps in addition to whatever dumb memes you pick.
Always have been.  
YEH BOIIII 
LETS GOOO 
We're going over, wait for it...
Those MMs voting illegally probably

Do it again with half. Take the rest and try another ticker or save.
Agreed LOL
come on CRSP


Supposed to do shares bud

 

 
Where did you bring it from?

its not over yet soldier
Lets gooo 
If I would have gone in on every meme stock this sub has suggested this year I'd be retired. Instead I decided to do "DD" and carefully select just one. I doubled my money on it, but I could have done that many times over.
It makes no sense and Im too tired to the depressed about it
i swear if i would of just thought puts? and not CRSR is going to rise again .. if id be fucking rich by now
it kinda happend to me friday when I moved the limit line on a chart thinking it was an alert..oops

Just throw it in and close your app for a few days
It's definitely both but when it goes tits up just blame it on the risk management department
Yeah, it fucking worked retard
Did you see a post on here saying careful fomo into ?

Dude same.
Oof. PLTR was always garbage stock but atleast if you hold BABA you will make money.
Momentum to the ground. This rocket is stuttering
Done!
Yup! Diversify folks. Buy shares and calls.
1300%. And you should not be acting like that happens a lot cash it
lol
i say anything over 1000 return you fecking GET THAT CASH, or flip a coin.
Hold till NKLa gets delisted
This is the way.
tsla really taught me to just roll shit out, got rid of some 500c awhile ago, now I wish I rolled lolol
Just got in this morning. Well carry this up. Its still got room to grow evident by this morning. It was trying for 610 but sellwall was a little too high since it was powerhour.
Why not both?
Retweet
like a beach ball at a nickleback concert
Shakin out paper hands.
Yes

Thats cause its 10:25 you fuckin idiot 
What does that mean papa

Because all their cash tied up in losing calls.
I sold my cost basis plus a little more, don't get too greedy too fast!
A man of culture I see
Exactly
IV lol, buying shares was the play today in GME
just be patient. its been an hour
DCA. Plan ahead to DCA
Same except I own less GME so Im retarded
Same... Glad I jumped in on the GME train
Thats all we need bois were gonna own GME EOD
... about the same here.
This is true.  If something is down big, it will keep going down after open and probably all day.  If it's up big, people will take profits at open, and you're better buying that dip.
ya learning this lesson the hard way... although just started dipping my toes in 2 weeks ago
PLTR will rocket
Which vaccine?
Which stonks
Wondering this too
Everythings down today... Im still green on weed bees but it hurts to see it down. Diamond hands 
There's a sale going on.
It's down half a percent rn while the market is crashing
What about the bee? The bee is bleeding
It wont in a month
Its dropping like a rock. Ive been buying the dip for like 3 straight days.
If you dont know it cant hurt youm
Same
wish i waited for it to dip this far, but at least i didnt buy the peak.
I did the same. Hoping for a rebound.
Bought more again in $24
Thanks for doing your part.
thank you
Thanks!
No
I bought more at 25.60 and at 25
Damn straight.
No friend no
Im barely green on the day and will probably end the day in the red, but I agree, this day is pretty good
Do you currently have the shits?
Positions?
same. on PLTR calls
fucking same
Ya apex, the Bee, GME, PLTR. Everything tanking.
Yeah Im down from 140% to 100%... oh nooo
YAS KING
I bought at 24.67, I can't believe that fucking worked.
I sold all my PLTR, bought puts and am very bearish on the PALANTIR, PLTR STOCK. Bad sentiment. Bad feeling, PLTR bad stock.

    take that, algo :p
This is the way
it is but it also feelsbadman.tiff
You get it at 24?
Plz
V shape recovery ftw
You should quit thinking on a intraday timeframe. So should I. But you should too.
To be fair that was a spookyass fucking rugpull. +8 to -12 in a heartbeat lmao
Lol gme is not going to grow quick. It's a long game. Most have been holding sideways since March.
Hodor! Hodor! Hodor!
I only own one dido
Why aren't you buying AMD????
Tha real MVP
You are a retard. Welcome sir
Nah will trade in this range until '23
Yes
Honestly, NO. You have look at how agency view them and not following internet meme.
.. yes? Thats the entire reason for its meteoric rise since IPO lol.
What do you mean, your job is trading options
My man
Like the recession is done or we're done and the recession is here?
Fap, post nut clarity, then decide
Have faith stay strong and watch some 
buy cheap calls
Buy it dumbass
Go enjoy a hobby

I mean, it was following the same trends as most other tickers this morning. Bought the dip
Lmao that was quite a dip

PLTR 12/11 30c 33c 35c all bought
Shes hot af so yes I will
is this something I should do, been looking at ICLN
Id love one from her
Still takes balls (and having cash to do it), I had both ready and pulled the trigger.
We need to open an investigation into the   s
The best part is my calls were still positive cause IV jumped so dam high
Yeah thats the last dip below 30. Once it crosses its never going back
Please be correct random internet stranger
It is amazing that even a single person is shorting Tesla right now...

great broker

What a name
The mobil app is garbage. (I just use the browser trading platform)

The full desktop app is 
Only retards..
Damn it. I missed it
Yeah I would imagine a lot of stop losses triggered on that dip. Like who the fuck is selling TSLA below $590, you had plenty of time
Not just the iPhones, but the AirPods and the MacBooks, too

#120EOD
iphone 13 announcement next week
That's what I'm thinking. I'm not too confident on GME at all but this support despite a broad sell-off is really good.
that warm cozy itch
APHA is the next cash cow
If you cant afford $18 shares of GME, you shouldnt be doing this.
$18.24
This is the way.
Lets fucking go $10c 1/15
Wow wonder if theirs a conflict of interest there
McDonalds Bullish on Many Burgers, But Downgrades Wendys, Burger King, Five Guys
No... they were cashing them. Lmao
Maybe you should learn to play the market instead of being one sided bull. I'm a bull but still made a quick 75% on IWM puts.
What a tease
Its truly a fucking rollercoaster that makes you have motion sickness
of course you did
Idk but Im glad. Its been trading in the same range for the past few weeks.
Come to western Washington, its dumping here
Im in Breckenridge CO and its poppin here
Global warming has no scientific proof. My Qanon group showed me.
Especially after their fierce competitor NKLA had that sudden drop. What the hell happened? Did gravity stop working? I dont understand this world.
Loaded up on some 12/24 8.5c and 12/31 9c this morning! Im ready 
I'm scaling into this bitch. She ain't done yet
520p's here.  At least one of us will be right.
Someone must have dumped about an hour ago, crazy how fast it rallied back
Every stock has done that today. FED buy limit got activated..
It is like a 2.5T stock so 2% up means like 3 PLTRs
Lol
Calls won't help the squeeze at all, free PS5s for share owners
buy dip fgt I guess. NKLA is a shitshow
Ouch. Buy them back?
Never heard of it. Is it like CORN? Whats the market for apples like?
Or if collectively everyone legit bought the same stonk
Rotate back
whats the BA rumor?
Whats the BA rumor now
Tomorrow and rest of the week green
yes he does
Is this the way?
that IV though... they need to go to 0 to pay off.

someone bought 1000 12/4 5p though...
facts
The holds on shares are extending through April now though, so time accordingly for a sell-off. Plenty of time for a repeat of the last dip and wildly climbing valuation when TSLA announces they're partnering or some bullshit
Lol please explain
Why?
Why?
h c a c.
Just stop caring and start slacking usually it gets better after that if you have the mentality of idgaf if u fire me
what kinda job is it
2 months but it was my first job after high school doesn't mean anything. We got fired because the employees threw their trash in the in parking lot the owner just blamed the 3 students who worked there
Find a new job before leaving your current job. Problem solved.
Just leave it off of the resume and put Day trader in place. Win win
<1hr
I did like 8 once. I was a valet/bellhop at a hotel as a college student. Got no respect from the front desk. Just try to do a 2 weeks notice and leave kn good terms even if there werent any in the first place. I fucked up by not doing that.
6 Months isn't the best stop gap but it's COVID. You can mask it as a 6 month freelance/contract position. 

But that also depends how the field is now where you are and if you believe you can find something. Start applying now and see if you get any feedback.
I own 500 shares lol wish I had more
Wait, who are they merging with?
What's the ticker? Let me in!!
welp you never pay us in the first place, you get what u paid  
Why would you set a stop loss.....
I just sold CCs on my shares, we will see if that was stupid or not
Want stonks go up more, but can't? Let them go down first!
$68 here sold at $52 after seeing douche ceo on fast money. Yes Id like to meet a nkla $90 bag holder if theyre still breathing. They gotta have a sense of humor

If we behave ourselves this sees $95 by wed
Yes. Is called life, being played out everyday.
On Thursday. Just sell a day before lol
yep, yep, you betcha
Yeah look what happened in Canada
Its definitely passing the house, Im not sure when the senate vote is but probably not for a while.
Yes
not wiped but feeling serious pain.
lunch time
I'm good. Just kinda not much going on. Got either red or moderate green, so I'm mainly hovering between -1 to 3% on the day. Kinda bored lol
My baba calls got rekt, but other stonks are doing good
If not then it will be after Thursday 
Hate that as a APHA holder too...
Bro... do you even meme economy? /r/MemeEconomy/
APHA $12 EOW

Book it
I have my calls primed and fkn ready
won't help that stock is already shorted to oblivion and yet still rises.
I just picked up 12/18 $45 calls before this jump
been trying to tell people to grab that dip the past hour
100 contracts of 1/15 10c 

500 contracts 1/15 20c
Keep holding brother its the next meme.
Yeah
Hold em tight
Those are not leaps lmao
If you've got skin in the game play in the game
No
NEVER, 60$ EOY
It was at 50 last Tuesday
I haven't seen one person post a PLTR put position. But for all these assholes it's not enough to win, they also need to make sure people lose, even if they are imaginary.
The bears were all pretending to be bulls until the stock went down 5%. Then they showed their true colors.
I just shorted 200 shares. I hedged with a couple protective calls at $40 strike 
I hope so Im so boooooored
I feel you..Ive been right about pretty much all of them for the last 3 weeks. Even bought NIKOLA puts 3 weeks ago. But Im a bitch that wont risk buying too many contracts

That wall at $16 has been killing us all day. Need more hype for it to breakthrough
For real, lets get the retard strength back
Month
it's consolidating on high volume, this is certainly a very bullish sign
MOOOON
It's under accumulation by the big boys, it runs up when they decide they have enough of it, train has more stops north of here ;)
fucking hope so!
only reason i still have it around for the yolo trades
E*TRADE has the same thing via transfer from a bank account
its not that simple
bzzzzzzz
rip
It was 600. How do I know u ask me? Bc I fkn bought that at this price
>yes
What price did u get it for?
 ftw
Weed stocks or actual weed
lol sure why not
Yes its going to sky rocket this week
I'm in heavy anticipating that it will at least break 20 on the earnings run up this week
Yeah BUDDY GO ALL IN 100%
Explain
the what now
400k shares and they are getting bought up..
So dumb. Itll hit 130 by next week regardless
Music to my ears
no
LOL @ Citrus guy
Cant trust the Chinese gov. Thats why I dont fuck with it.
Thats oddly specific friend
Theta won.
Hold on tight buddy
It will
Average down. Do your part!
post proof =\
27 is a good price for consolidation, I think we'll start back up at a less meme pace after a few weeks
Broke out of the wedge at 119.13
Not too late. I'm thinking $135 by EOW. Been posting it since $117 this morning. Manifest it!
Lmfaooo
So why not wait to execute?
Exercise and sell the shares?
Spoken like a true retard
I had puts back when Covid hit and couldnt get out of my position for a whole afternoon. 
Never again.
to the shadow realm with you, Jimbo
shits gonna tumble
It always feels like that doesn't it.
You just bought now? Lmao
Ooooh just like that Timmy! Just like that!
Probably gonna happen just shut down schools in the Midwest.
Yea imagine being smart and not waiting for them to crash like always.  I wish I could imagine that. :(
maybe they need some play money for the arcades
Bullish
Thank all the moms trying to find their kids and "xblox" for Christmas.
no it isn't
Boomer company
 I have $11C for 12/18 that are slowly climbing back into positive %, slowly but surely.

Boring Monday?

You must not have followed Tim Apple to the promised land
I see you out there grindin
flatter than my gf's ass
I am too, feeling like $27 has been a solid floor today
I saved you a seat.
Tomorrow it is going to move 10 percent one way or the other.
No options volume
$320k position strong here 
Its about to dump hard and fast
Positions?
If it ends above 600 ill give you $100
That would mean TSLA spent all day getting back to the first fifteen minutes of the day.
....again.
we got this my man
Good luck my brother!  Same, bad run of luck lately but here's to hoping it turns around for us both!
I also did that same call on that same day!
Interesting
it's weird, isn't it? Check out PSTH, flat as fuck.
Like.. Eskimo brothers ?
Eskimo brothers
ALL IN BABY
Gawd damn beauty
this is the way
Is this like a copypasta at this point?
Do u think apex is the real deal....bought some in my ira last week, thinking about buying more
If youre holding a very low volume option and someone puts a high bid in, the price will reflect that. Happens sometimes
Lmfaoooooo
Must be. I somehow managed 9.6% one with my entire portfolio being PLTR. Definitely a glitch.
SQ to 300 by 2022
Monster recovery today
This is the way.
You will be rewarded.
So 1 call?
IV?
SPACs move up overnight.  will really take off EOW/next week into the 20s and 30s
I bought a few calls because I knew the news headline would lead to a spike. 

Was I right? Yeah. So why will these expire worthless? Because the news came out in premarket

You win some, you lose some.
Oh no this bitch is flying this month. Im mad I didnt buy more on dip this morning
I thought overbought and took my tendies out
Overbought but Im in it for the long term. Keep shares.
Honestly, hoping for a dip back into the 7s or 8s to climb on
Your calls are fucked my friend.
god i hope..
Yesssir
Hahahah lifee
Same but +20k and -15k
PLTR
Gme bro
APHA we should all buy it so i can make bucks
Weed stocks
So, since you cant spell Stanford, the bar is not set very high?
IPOD opened today. Look at SPCE, IPOB for ref. 
You can get in early or wait until people are tired of NIO 

Check out the cyber monday specials on NIO and PLTR calls
RKT (not pumped yet but with two stellar earnings calls)
XLE: energy sector is still beaten down relative to other sectors.
ULTA: one of the few Becky stocks that hasn't fully recovered yet. Earnings call on Thursday. I reckon it will hit $300 after earnings.
Patience and millennials do not mix.
Everyone has weeklies.
Opening at 9 tomorrow
Will get it after hours
Ban
Should have trusted
Id cream my panties
Gosh I hope. 600 shares @ 12.60
I lost a bunch on 40c weeklies this morning, but caught the falling knife on the 30c weeklies and monthly and made all that back and then some already.
Up 80k in 30 days and it's like whatever
go spend some of it so it feels real :)
what's the actual ticker for this stock?
No one cares if you bought calls idiot
your posts are going to be the reason your calls expire worthless

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path\_sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence)
How low do you think it will go? Ive avoided shorting it because idiots over at r/NIKOLACORPORATION keep buying it up. Seems the sentiment over there has finally turned negative on the GM news
Uptick rules bro... only reason why! 

Expect a major gap down again tomorrow
And clucks here think PLTR which is a real company with real contracts and a real product is gonna tank.



PLTR 
Share lock up ends today. Tomorrow will be the real dump.
Bullish
Bean dip v shaping imo
Shhhhh
strike exp
Best losses maybe
What happened to the pump? I'm sitting here with fat red numbers
i agree man fuck that piece of garbage. killed the momentum
Expose and short a few legit scams, when you get a few of those under your belt. Start putting random ass PTs on legit companies then go short. Sheeps sell based off your reputation. Boom, stonks.
Profit taking from weak paper hands as well
Perfect launching point to $30
What does that mean if anything
Yup 12/4 expiry has a massive OI at $30 strike
What about buying weekly zoom calls right before earnings? After losing $8k on PLTR today. Am I retarded?
  
Buy the dip, bunch of sticks
Oh my
Legally making money off of weed from my phone; what a time to be alive.
people with call options
WTF
Yoooo...
I got shook out. That thing looks like a death wish rn
Best description i've read all day. Calls rose into close when the stock dropped so im not mad if they can turn it around in dong kong tonight
Yee
I hope we moon tomorrow

Been extremely boring being a bee past couple days
Guys Im starting to worry we wont be doubling our tendies
The bee does its best work in the dark
Recounts netted more Biden votes for millions of dollars XD
Congrats good sir, welcome to the WSB hall of fame

Bro stfu
Better scream louder then.
Calls ?
I write articles at citron
Money cult keep bangin
We'll be one when the guy eats shit while we chant PLTR in a circle around him.
People are like three fucking weeks late at this point. It sucks seeing people fight the original DD, a chunk of people make absolute bank, and then people at the end are fighting for scraps after fomo and calling anyone who is getting out with 30k+ a bunch of paper hands.
Can't wait for open. Going to grab 1,000 more. Total 3,000
Source; Trust me bro
what's the chances it hits $40?
More like 20
its over.
Im bullish but damn 
Trade on your phone in a meeting. Im working from home in a zoom conf call right now. I got pornhub and WallStreetBets open on tabs and trading on my phone. Loaded up on Tesla 12/11 calls in the dip. Fucking best day ever. Its up 15 since the dip
You'll get another chance at it in a few minutes.
Yeah, Microsoft always has to be unique.
Go buy a HyperX headset they're cheap comfy asf and will not break
Positions or ban
Uh... tell me how you did it?
Positions?
Im up a little too. Mostly Apple and PTON. And big NVAX.
Lmfao
Positions, now
$700
What's this rumor I keep seeing? Well not the rumor I guess but where is the story coming from?
My price target is $30 by EOD, $36 by EOW.
I couldn't imagine what that would do to this sub
These fucking paper hands are unbelievable
No return policy
Sorry. You and I have both been scammed
I am
Yep. People care more about some lemon fund than they do fundamentals.
well since half the tards bought weeklies at 31 they're just gonna get theta raped, hence the selling.
It was like 3 weeks of hell. Retard echo chamber to the fullest extent
Us capitalists are ruthless
This is how you guys react after a couple down days after a massive run up?
Too many people in this sub have paper hands
I cant give u an upvote. But I can give you an upstroke
Fuck yes my dude!
This is the way
Bought some short dated calls from paper hands this morning and easiest gain in minutes
Literally have my entire acct in it
Low quality post from a mod. Not even a sticky. Ban yourself.
It would be really cool if you guys could let us autists know how you define low quality submissions.
Mods ban this guy
You must be bored
mods are gay
Jannie jannie clean it up
I see you sat on an XL BBC this morning 
Any plan on a backup for the site when reddit pulls the rug on this sub?

Reddit keeps taking the ax to subs endlessly and subs think it won't happen to them right up until it happens.
Thanks dude
well done

you're still gay though
What qualifies as a low quality submission? Spamming tickers like its a horse race?
Look, just because I appreciate the janitor doesn't mean I'm up for hearing him brag about about all the shit he scrubs.
DD banning spree? The bottom is in! All in on anything!
There's been a noticeable bump in comment quality. Thanks, mod.
Thanks.
Doing the work of the lord
You know a simple fix is. Raise the karma minimum value for posts.
Doing the lords work. Thank you
Thank you!
wow add on to their wound

Submission meaning in the subreddit a literal post or in the daily thread
This is just related to posts, and not comments, correct?
That sounds like a nightmare, thanks for the work
How about doing something about those low quality robes? Every time you walk by I have to check myself for fleas.
I like fast and hard
Better have Muhammad Ali diamond hands
I bet most people invested in PLTR have no idea what they do.
Same guys that bought Pizza with the 50 bucks they made with TSLA a few month ago.
Bro why do people try to convince others into buying. If you want to buy go for it but spamming the thread with rocket symbols is annoying as fuck
Weed 
Thats my new bitch 
All my homies hate Citron
lmao if gme dont print imma be sad
HahahH
Lmao if those people could make money off your suffering they would do it too. 

Stop acting like you have the morale high ground you sad cuck
NOT FUCKING SELLING


HAHAHAHAHAHA
fuckin retards, enemies of the sub
The shorts. Diamond hands brother. The fire rises
Too many sellers unfortunately

Give me confirmation bias on clean energy stocks plz
!emojify
Honestly, your comment is okay except spce. Only literal pieces of shit try to get people to buy it on here. Its worthless, people don't even put it on your watchlist.
C O N S O L I D A T I O N
Pick the up direction ty
Do I ride down to -99% or sell soon 
Im holding calls but theres no chance of that
You sound like last friday. Eventually you'll be right, but the later you are, the cheaper i can buy back in and get a second wave of palantir goodness. Thanks for hodling ma dude.
Bought at 12 
That just redirects to brokebitches.com
more more more more more
We fall in live with our winners instead of taking profit and not looking back.
Exactly, let it cool off a little. Then to the moon boys. 
MORE MORE MORE MOAAR
at least youre not the dude that convinced his father in law to drop 200k at the top
U lost like 2% from friday's dip
Did they put a gun to your head too? Take responsibility for your own retardation.
smooth  
Ive got $40 12/24, say a prayer tonight
$30 12/04 gg ez
2 months ago at $9
Best we can do is 10% if you have original packaging.
look at the volume.  The ticks down have all been on weak volume and the upward ones have huge volume. This is great for later this week.
GME short squeeze has been a story told for the past 6 months that has never happened
It is, 5% up is still a MASSIVE day
Fuck yes.
Hear hear!
is every EV spac / stock a pump and dump? the answer is clearly maybe
Gme
GME shares, save my calls
ATM DISCA calls for Wednesday
CMPS buy the dip at open
the down thing or the up thing
Actually it touched $20
20 actually lol
Happened last week with PLTR and I bought in (my 3rd so its not too bad) but it dropped that day so careful now
such an Alabama move
When does the merge happen?
Looks like Tesla is back at August stock split levels who cares
my April 25 calll is happy is happy to see it
Spacstic?
$694.20 EOW
Bruh it is basically at 600 rn.
Strike and exp?

Dec 2nd
Should be later this week
This week, can't really find a date though.


Easily over 500 today
Shhh 
Tesla is not in the SP500 yet. I think its getting added in two tranches, one the 14th and the other the 21st
Yes
Deeeee-troit baaas-ket-baaaaalll!
Bid/ask isn't updated for options after hours genius. IV is very high though you're right. Best entry for options is after earnings on the 8th.
Seriously
isn't TSLA already part of the S&P?
Been bagholding since $13.  
Shit is heavy yo.
Thanks bro
Whats going on with DKNG?
I dont invest in gambling.
short squeeze gang
Hype, FOMO, circlejerk popularity, expectations
Not too late to jump in.
Might load up some just in case, super cheap
How? Looking at an ATM call.
You spelled yolo wrong
BABA getting gangbanged by 3 different countries. Idk how it will survive
you're not alone
My state 6-7am is reserved for the old and high risk lol
WMT midnight shopping runs are the best

usually empty, but the people that are there are pure [people of walmart](https://www.peopleofwalmart.com) and its a good time
Someone give me a play for tomorrow boys ready to Yolo $1k!
I wasnt even here in June and I feel that vibe.
My only problem is I didnt buy enough
yes
no
Buy CRSP they will
Count it as an early Christmas gift for the call seller
There's always hope.

That's what I'm telling myself, at least. I also have those.
I got 35c down 30% you might as well hold it to see what kind of gains you can get back.
You ducking degenerate
There's hope. Just hope for a week of back to back 10% gains
Probably not. Theta's going to burn extra hard on that one. Probably need it to trade flat and then suddenly pop to $34 in power hour.
I did too for 12/11
Ya not going near anything Chinese right now with US government threatening to delist if they dont start sharing their tendies
Its a meme stock what do you expect?
GM said GTFO
Pumped on news it signed the deal with GM.

Crashed again when the 'GM gets equity stake in NKLA' was not a part of it lol.

The original plan was to be live in fuck buddies. GM changed the agreement that NKLA is just a booty call.
Were on like week 3 of non stop good news
i love confirmation bias too
Trillion dollar valuation in 5 years
One of the main reasons Im invested.
694.20
694.20
Pretty sure he fled the country already
Be thankful and buy the dip we   for the real gains
Most here have sub 10k accounts and want to buy options that aren't 5% of their account value. Honestly only rational.
Can't stop.
12/15 25C on ICLN they looking good
I feel like this stock is relatively slept on. I have 2 long calls and I'm here to make money
This will be my first etf
Me first!
I sold my shares the day before they announced the S&P inclusion 
See ? This is why the squeeze won't happen
A tear downward maybe
Tomorrow he can
Lmfaooo equity raise last minute
Isn't that months old?
My friend is a PLTR dev out of D.C. Seriously the smartest guy I know. They hire the best.
Holding NKLA calls I see
"BuT THe us HAd the highest single cases" stock market don't care about common lives
OPEN
Half and half
Buy puts
It might actually run to 2$
How is your week going?
Pfe isnt bad. Hold.
Just hold Pfizer
Wait until end of day. I feel a sell-off coming for Moderna and Palantir.
buy bntx and not pfizer. why nobody understands that bntx is the vaccinemaker not pfizer (logistics).
I had 1000 shares of RKT that I dumped for THiCB
Why shouldn't it go green? Milton wants to sell right?
**655**
Yes but it shouldnt be
BAN
Ban
FOMO go all in!
If youre buying stock go for it
Limit orders don't affect whether brokers lend shares. In margin accounts with uncovered margin balances brokers will lend shares. In cash accounts you can tell your broker to not lend shares.
the limit order thing doesn't work
Limit sell set to $600
People still believe this BS? This was debunked years ago lol
I'm bullish af just because the word Quantum is in the company's name
They have 3 years before a product release so there will be time for an entry
Loving it. Probably going to sell at open and buy in latwr
Got $30 puts last week on the up Im ready to cash them out
Jelly, prob gonna enter some right at open
Sort by hot and scroll down a bit, theres a thread with a bunch of websites that track wsb trends
They already did it's called $MOON
Paltry is what chickens are.  Chickens are what make tendies.  Tendies=good.  Im down!
i've got $48 allowance i'm trying to YOLO on a buying a call option what do you think i should buy?
An actively managed ETF of the top 5 meme stocks? Dont want to diversify TOO much.
Ofc DKNG. Its free money 
Holy shit. 4 months in and they've done fuck-all. Lmao. Why did this thing move at ALL last week.
BABA is a boomer stock now
Which broker are you using that doesn't have an app or website? o\_O
Happy cake day hoe
hold
You make sure they're not made of paper
Im in on 12/4 10C on APHA
For TSLA wait till the 10:30 dip
50-50
Shares, calls dont help the squeeze
Shares
shares, shares do much much more to trigger a squeeze
Shares, otherwise the short squeeze doesn't work
Both
shares. bc of the squeeze. calls not the play
Ive had a $17 call on standby for about a week now. Depending on how much it shoots though. If much, buy calls. If little, stocks
Calls are expensive. High IV
Been in APHA since $15 :(

But my bags are getting lighter :)
You very smart. I'm about to get in soon.
Hop on
Nope hasnt popped yet. They are keeping pressure under 18. After that breaks straight to 20!
50:50
Buy, you really wanna watch free money print in front of you? 
buy
40EOW
PLTR. Dip is creating good entry point
I've had both for a while
Wait for a dip on PLTR
If you put in a market order will that go through?
Buy at open
Open
Mfs really out here defending NKLA??
I'm also crying
You playing options or just shares?
nice move man you are doing well , keep killing it
My favorite part is when you realize the ticker is actually CRSR and panic
I would suggest CRSR instead
Samsies
I second this fact
Thats how I start every trading day lol.
Can confirm that is weird
me too. call me an autist but are you gonna wait to sell or do it once it peaks cause of EV?
Mama mia
Why? :o
IKR. Got some outs aint printing this week
Smart man.  Put that limit sell on now to help the short squeeze l.

Watch that guy eat shit.  Thats all I care about.
I sold so many weeklies calls now worthless haha
Lets go! You get shares or warrants?
Death
Ditto.  WTF if wrong with this thing?
I hope so
I found the idiot bear.
Reminds me of sports fans who lose their minds when their basketball team goes down by 2 points in the first quarter. Fuckin nerds
Hold on there boy you telling me you made a whole 50 today! Impressive
done
I did too. I put 5k on the line. lol
I did my part
nah not even

atleast nothing like what a squeeze would be
Sideways for a while now.
How long to hold GME?
You mean losing money
I to like to buy at the top
It will PUSH DONT WORRY. Shorts are shitting their pants rn
Yeah wtf is this shit
They had 10 deep green days in a row
Our day for bankruptcy once lockout comes?
SO you saying this may be a good opportunity to buy?

This stock trades on news too damn much tbh
Its also down on a Bloomberg article last night than Ant IPO probably wont happen until 2022. But also not a big deal.
I wonder why that is? Seems like everyone market sells 30 minutes after open and then it moons again
Youre welcome
In a good way?
Y
$500
I WAS HOLDING FOR MONTHS AND FINALLY SOLD TO BUY MORE PLTR

FUCK MY FUCKING LIFE
Thems too low
Big brain
ball-istic? 
testi-calls?
SPY calls are more retarded than anything right now
I feel you brother. I took a byte of both and while spy was sour as shit, gme couldnt get any sweeter.
Aint no one got shit to sell, over cover lol
Institutions doubling down on their shorts. Will only help the squeeze
GME
This is the way
Everybody else is dumping
When its spammed by everyone and anyone, you know you missed the boat.
Na man! First sign of green in the market, this train going non stop to tendie land.
Yes
look out belowwwwwwwwww
Right? LOL
No no it's the right way! Needs its downtime before blast off
The fuvk chart you looking at?
:(
Don't do that. Don't give me hope
At this point , I wish I did. Lost half my portfolio since Thursday from not cashing out early morning.
Bro same
It will
market overall is down today. Wouldnt sweat it unless you have calls that will expire in the next 2 weeks
Be strong homie
Tomorrow green
Don't pile on to a meme stock after it's already been pumped into the stratosphere retard
Hold mongoloid
lotta of the market is red rn
Quit looking at the numbers and do something useful. It's only an hour into monday, jeez.
B O G G E D

what color lambo you gettting?
You can't afford a lambo with 13k retard. Thank God you put it in gme cause by eow we can get matching aventadors
At what price did you get in on gme lol
Let me introduce you to APHA
CASH GANG 
Lmao retard. Me too
This happens pretty often. Definitely not a big drop enough yet to be a correction yet.
A correction is when people take profits on a stock that's had a massive run.
Cold hard cash momma
This is genius
cash gang feelin great right now baby
what little cash I have left after my BABA calls got butchered
I lost so much money today
Are you enjoying that IV orange crush?
what about now? It's down -12%
wiping out the retards
F

LOL
i'm with you brother! what date you thinking?
Please dont play gme 
Nice going
Shares should be alright, right? We can baghold for a year
Right wtf
Lololol
I would but it dipped so low my stop loss was triggered... :(
hell no im out of that shit
gay bers and cash gang celebrate
*tumbleweeds slide into frame*
New players welcome:)
it's a system that cleans itself
Exactly
ATH. Time for another correction.
Same learned my lesson trying to  Friday and GTFO
"buy the dip" lololol
Hey that worked!
Thank you for your service.
doubly retarded, they cancel out
Boomer stonks down too, though.
Amen
No shit man me too. DKNG and BABA punching me in the dick.
WSB and P&Ds in the limousine
We are having a FIRE sale.
why would you tell people to cut losses on a very red day? that advice is absolutely retarded. You buy on red, and sell on green. Just in case you didn't know.
You mean Puts Love These Retards?
NOW
Life in the big city they said
tis a blessed day to buy thee dip
Fuck no
YES. I would but everything in my brokerage is already in GME
Lets goooo
Tendies aren't always on time
Thank you for your sacrifice
yo, thanks dude my pltr calls started printing
Firesale
rising covid cases?  it's what ever is the flavor of the day. NYC almost 5% positivity rate.  and also bitches panic selling
We dip after you put your hands up on my hip when I dip you dip we dip
I'm wondering too wtf everything's red
MACD positive now as well
Same??
This is why everyone preaches don't paper hand
What did you sell
yuh
 Remember stonk always 
 There you go buddy        
More u go down, higher u fly.
can I be part of that religion that worships Stonk Jesus?
No what?
There are probably a lot of people with close-to-expiry calls on PLTR here, so it was probably much worse than that tbh.
People here have portfolios? I thought it was just buying options and thats it
market can feel like that sometimes but I assure you, you are not that important
Top is in
Stay frosty, this ain't over yet
Whens the announcement though?
Yeaaaa hope this merger goes thru today AH
PLTR intraday can either make you rich or poor depending of your entry point if you spot trading. crazy fun stock.
who buys shares ?
Sold on the way down, bought at just past the dip 
The only people who havent sold are ones who have been in since 15. They will never admit this though. A lot of the people who bought between 25-30, im sure have paper handed after 2 20% swing days back to back..
fucking pussies

this is war not green soldiers running when its hitting 30 thats crazy
Not in it but this might be a dead cat bounce
I want to get in but will wait probably till end of day. Overall market is poor right now
Thats what im learning
smart
>RIOT

Ya it's insane - RIOT is printing so much fucking money for me right now.
already up 40%
Bought that tsla T shaped dip baby, 600c 12/4. Free money
The bottom
Nice catch

Could be something to do with the suncore/syncrude deal
saudis bought a yuge stake in that in june
This is the way
Yeah I was like 'eh' this morning, and then it dipped below $18.00 and I figured how bad can it be.
They wont win
both
Its unbelievable they cant stand one red day
1k is nothing you can DoorDash/Uber that in under a week.
 100x 10c
Here.
Yep. Bought some FVRR stock because a year ago some guy recommended here and its like 900% up. 

If I had paid attention I would have sold at 2x returns
All the time lol
Holding till Friday at least
Same in the South
I ended up buying Feb21 $30&40 plus own 200 shares and sold weeklies against. Took some
Gains I to options oh insanely high option volume weed stock which cannot be mentioned here. Rhymes with s&dl
VTI/VXUS
All the ARK etfs and QQQ.
IWM
ARKK seems to be popular here
RSP
I like renewables, TAN and ICLN are good
ARKG, genomics is going to fucking explode as the COVID vaccine turns us all into mutating zombies
I like ACES (Clean Energy ETF)
Arkk
Shhh dont tell them
What a rollercoaster this morning has been lmao
Boring? Lmaoo
If this was boring u dont know what your doing to be honest
it's going to continue, it's one of the most shorted stocks ever, volatility is nutty.
Given how volatile today for has been for PLTR the net result really isnt that bad atm
 USA USA cant go tits up
This afternoon has been so boring compared to the morning.

Shit was popping
& I just bought 50. It isn't much but it's honest work
BUY MOAR TO MAKE IT SOAR!!!
Its just Biden injuring his foot. It would have gone to the moon. 
Me too I piled on during the dip lol
o7 Im doing my part!
Where were going - you dont need luck.
I like 12/18s sector wide  with hope for a bump on 12/15 when Mexico decides to legalize.

No. That is evaluating it like a software company. It is a hardware company with low margins on its core business PC components. The peripheral business is more profitable but that is less than 18% of the business.
Tell us why
fuk x2
Whatcha get for your wife's boyfriend?
Lmao you are poor

My wife bought the $99 shoe rack because we are rich AF
Yeah especially when dollar is going to shit
facts of life
thic bitch for sure its just getting started
THC boi got news coming on 3rd dec so...
WeedB votes this Thursday on the extension, GME releases earnings next Tuesday after market.
Yes but should print
ICLN is one of the safest plays on the board. Its a long term hold and good place to store your winnings.
Shares are going to be a better return for your investment vs calls.
Great long term play. Steady gains through 2021 in my opinion. I picked up some April 25c last week. Not flashy, but smooth gains every month for the last few months.
30
25 realistically
Yeah theyre like a bipolar bitch that doesnt know if she wants to fuck or not.
Whatchu got?
Literally only worth it to day trade. Buy EOD and sell at open. Cant hold anything.
Weed is green. Bullish.
Whered you find them?
Yeah where wtf
Calls or puts
which?
How?
Yeah where??
you could have just said Dontstop
Man them deals dont last long :)
What is it ?
Sir yes sir
Locked and loaded since $22.30 
I just got an email from them asking for an interview where I give them feedback on their app/tools, should I do it and blast them?
I think the idea is shares because its not clear when the squeeze will happen, and shares also encourage the squeeze itself
shares can net you 3x easily
Depends on your definition of bigly. But you probably won't make a ton of money on purely shares. You won't lose a ton either though
Do 12/18 calls 17-20 range. Keep close eye around earnings (12/8) and sell week or Monday before expiration
Shares for safe play, options for gamble
GME is a very long term play, were talking years. Even 50 shares 10x would be nice profit. Any options play should be very long term (2022). You could go for some short term lottery ticket since WSB might spike this thing.
Up ofc just take one hour and read the basics about their business and do some research about BigData Market Potential. PLTR is a nobrainer like TSLA.
Bears not letting it moon. Need back up pump
im at 71% and im not concerned so you might b smarter than me
if you were down 30% earlier, then you should be happy with a 10% loss
Its price target is 30 for a reason. It is a hardware company with the bulk of its products with low margin (p/c components).
My 7 year old nephew plays it, I'll ask him. He's bullish on IPO though, that's for sure. Says he's betting his piggy bank on it along with 1 ice cream sandwich and a stay-up-late card on it.
my 10 year old asked for her allowance to be paid in robox each month.  she wakes up 30 min early to log in and do her daily whatevers for in-game money.  

any dope can make a roblox game of any kind, the kid's characters hop in and out of them, and dollar signs fly around.
So I was certain that there was no way it's bigger than Minecraft but a cursory Google says I may be wrong, Roblox apparently has around 150m MAU as of this year, Minecraft is a little lower I think (130)

I'm very surprised, Roblox's largest demographic is <12 years old. Something like 50 percent of the players are tweens

Edit:

More cursory googling, if Roblox seriously has 150m MAU, which it looks like it does, it is over a lot of shit I'm familiar with

150m MAU puts it over Apex Legends, League of Legends, and I'm pretty sure Warzone only has like 75m total players

Idk I'm pretty shook right now

https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/roblox-jumps-to-over-150m-monthly-users-will-pay-out-250m-to-developers-in-2020/
Yeah, I saw their gift cards being sold at Food Lion in redneck SC, calls at IPO
The memes are better here
Interest lost
This is why you buy shares
Dunno about that man
Why
Im feeling the same way. Tf
Waste of my sleeping hours. I work overnight

Bought at .25 sold at .6 twice in a month. Clockwork.
Merger with who?
Theres a merger for sun dial? Been looking at it.
I know 1/15 is actually a short term play but relative to most gambles here that is downright responsible
Up 94% this month, do you really see it going up much more?
Sell at $30
The second I see a 20 on the screen Im out bruv
gonna exit at 27 when it runs. dude just look at qs another ev battery maker and chill out. what ur selling here, im buying is all im sayin
if you sell immediately after merger confirmation you're retarded. that's what most are waiting on before they buy in
yup
My friend had 3k shares for like a week and sold last Tuesday. RIP.

Buy more
Youll be fine but those dips are annoying as fuck, 50c dip in 1 minute like wtf
12/24 9c get in
1/15 15c 
1/15 9c 8 contracts
pltr this morning was crazy
Why? It has done nothing but tanking since I bought it
I put 2k, and it instantly lost me $110
Holding
I bought some calls, just for shits and gigs
> Sundial

Foh with your bullshit penny stocks
Easy
GME if you want to be part of something, or APHA if you're up for a risk.
GME is the WSB yolo play currently
APHA $20 calls.
GME hoe
Are you kidding? Why haven't you bought $TSLA calls yet?
TAN calls. Red days like this are a rare blessing so you can load up.
Amd calls
are you - me? 

SPY PUT 350 12/28
RMG
fuck that epstein company man the name brings bad voodoo
Hoping people load up now before we're speeding back towards $600.
PLTR put holders =

Infinity SQUEEEEZZZE
No volume
Dude same thing with me lol. I was hoping it would stay red till tomorrow
Whats crsr
I did my duty!... but also bought ACB.... lets hope this shit pumps more! (Shares on margin) calls are fucking expensive lol
Bullets expensive af. Spent like $200 just in bullets at the range last week
Learned that lesson back in april
Long time
no penny stocks
why 
Because it trapped me into buying at the top of the rally 
To dump to bag holders.
$95 by wed
Bought the dip perfectly today
Oh God my Amd leaps have been red since early September.  Will they actually print?
i FOMOed in at $43.
this is same pattern when it hit 500$. just ppl selling at 600$ gonna pump to 700 EOM
Yerppp $APHA 


Dad, this is your long lost son...
Whats going on with CRSR
Ankle weighted donkey kicks my boy
Yeah not just you. I have at least a month on all my calls, but I think I'm addicted to the adrenaline rush.
lmfao i feel ya. nice that theyre usually green tho when the rest is red. which ones u got?
Ditto
You wont be able to taste the gains
Damn hoss...what's it feel like?
Trading with covid blows. Spent the last two weeks doing it. Hope you have a mild case :-)
get better soon!

This is going back to 603 tomorrow morning
This is the way

librarian fantasy. and she is a genius + autist like us. I'd have her babies any day
Hold till December 3rd
Buy the fucking dip son
Original DD said buy and hold a few weeks. You're like halfway there lol. If you bought and are agonizingly worried about where it's at then you've probably already made 20-25%. DD was to buy now and close your eyes and wait and see a couple weeks in December.
Hold for $QS chart
2day.
Many more dips ahead.
Short squeeze
Where
For what
me too except without the 00,000
Not even a pump. Straight up teleportation.
This is the only possible explanation
It's went from like 380 to 600 in like a month
Just like life my guy
How much for APHA? $7.5 or lower
Flat girls.often have great asses!
open YouTube and type M1
Fuck if I know, just buy
The doctors wanted to short it but as u know an apple a day keeps the doctor away so they left and now its mooning
All aboard 
One of these is different though

Blockbuster didnt pivot and died.

Netflix pivoted to streaming and thrived.

Question is, can GME still make a move to keep it alive?
It does this like every week itll be right back in 2 days
i do belive aapl has been oversold, and should def be above its current price, i got june calls so whenever it surpasses 134 is up in the air but i def believe it will go above that point
Hexo hit the $8.40 with Canadian legalization, it can do it again. Thats a lot of room to run. BUT, they have a reverse split coming to prevent delisting, beware.
25
25
I think 50. If it gets really crazy might go to ATH
I would be a millionaire if this happens
Feels like APHA hasn't moved in the last 4 hours. I need something to start happening here.
really think 20+ eoy? seems like 12-13 is more likely
do it we gap up tomorrow

No? Dont do it lol
Possibility it still goes up over night. Id sell it tomorrow if you bought
Get an end of December call on AAPL for the Christmas runup
AAPL doesn't have the power to move like that anymore 

if you want to yolo yolo into a meme stock where you have a chance of making your strike at least
Youre dumb. Its gonna consolidate around 119-120 next day or 2 then move higher past 121
130 too high for this week man
I would buy some PLTR stock and sell a covered call or sell a few cash secured puts on that or GME
hell yea brother
Thats just the game nowadays... great earnings, great company, strategic growth... but the MMS gotta eat too right? Just buy the fucking dip retards, look at Elgatos product line and all of your favorite streamers who use them. This company is going to the moooooon
yeah I bought the first dip Friday morning, 44.20 average, not sweating it
Way long
Long schlong
Nope watching it like a hawk to buy puts on it
scooped up a couple shares last week
Inverse this youll literally print
Where we headed?

Thats literally what I did
sorry we rotated into gme
Which one
Its all about the final 10
Green tabasco sauce hopefully 
The bull in me likes this
This. It's because it's the least expected. J. Pow talking should cause a bump, got a feeling it doesn't and the market has a 2% day across the board.
If we see a 50+ gap up Im screaming.
I say we go with electric blue
No moves was the move today
Got calls till January 
After a day like this it can only moon
It hit $1500. Hopefully you had your order in to sell. It plummeted to $4 almost immediately after
No quite the opposite. If you bought at the top 18.90 like me, you have been cucked like a piece of smegma
It got rescheduled until tomorrow.
Not sure. Starting to think the "squeeze" was a misinformation campaign to get us to buy their shares at an inflated price.
Oh triple? I meant to stay the shares would trifle. As in, these triflin-ass-hoes.
Theyre literally shaking off the weak hands
i should buy an tesla car instead
I mean 5.5 million

Today was scary juju. But I didnt sell
Lets print!!!
How do you think homelessness happens
That means youre still up 67%
What were you in? I am about flat all told.
Been seeing that too

Dont lie, if it doesnt moon youre gonna let a shemale hooker pound you anyway
MODS
MODS !!!!
So you bitch bois don't come for me, anything above 10% is considered a moon for me
It...  
!RemindMe 10 hours
The definition of mooning shall mean going up at least 30% from the previous closing price. Mods!
I know a shemale named Citron.
You listened to us?

This is the way.
Dont fucking sell bro you committed

I mean its pretty new on the scene in terms of hype. Very well could be the best it gets
nah nah hes breaking up anyway
Easy money
Till the end brother
I pussies didnt buy MORE on the dip
I refuse to believe this is real
Expiry?
Yeah if no one sells

AAPL is my only put. 
I had a buy limit in for 24. It bottomed out at 24.11. Heated
Youre missing GME
Missing APHA
no GME?
>CRSR 

No, 100% PLTR is diversified, since they own the world anyway
they did exactly what I expected: sky high open for buy, then a drop, followed by panic

Lets fucking go baby
God Id nut so fucking hard
God I fucking hope so
Down seems more likely
comment if youre retarded
hold
PLTR 40c weekly hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Holding 
GME catalysts - 

overnight - more margin calls arrive in short sellers' inboxes, short covering continues

next 8 days - runup to earnings

Dec 8 - earnings call should include positive updates on cost-cutting and holiday sales so far

mid-Dec - more consoles become available for sale
If every other comment on the daily is the same play, you already missed the major upside. 

You may still benefit and see light from the star, but it already supernova'd and it's only a matter of time until the last photon hits your eyes.
This is WSB
Oh gosh
It appears nobody has, its in free fall.
PLTR lost it's position as meme stock.  
Now Thick BEE is my best friend.
Paper hands bitches around here going dump more prematurely than I ejaculate
If PLTR would go down a little that would be nice so I could buy in. But I'll probably just sell some OTM puts today. Either I get payed for waiting or I get assigned at a price that I feel is comfortable.
i was like wtf have i done after putting over $6000 on shares on friday
In the year fundamentals died everyone still believes in the mechanics of a short squeeze so it seems. Im a newbie so Im just here for the show baby
Did you really think money would come that easy?
I sold for 50% loss and picked up cheap Apple calls and NKLA puts
We will have our day. I hope you bought for out enough.
Think of this pain as life experience. It'll make you strong.
PLTR is a dude?
lol
This is the way
Just buy GME
Who's forcing you to be here, whiner?
This is what i did! Bought 14 of em and only lost 30$ so far!

But i'm here for that SQUUUUEZE!

there are way to many sellers, not one buyer? RIGGED
If you feel like you will, you probably will lol. Its also one of those things where if you buy in itll crash. If you dont itll skyrocket

With you there
best strategy indeed
does this mean I have to downvote you
Hahaha

Sold out of PLTR and got 12/18 630c. Elon is my father now

I bought that dips boys
Just needs to get passed $585

Wtf you talking about the gains weren't as great as nio

Oh, so thats why my trades have been better recently

Doesnt look like it tbh, but id be happy if it does

Did the piece actually come out or two trading days after just the twitter blurb? But I'm long too. Sold some puts.
30 too easy. lets go for 35
Regularly
yes, lumps all over my body. But can't get diagnosed if you never go to the doctor
Found the guy who bought at 32
Thank you
Yes
No idea. I love buying junk from there
Because eBay itself is trash? They sell all the parts that work (PayPal, in Germany also their platform eBay Kleinanzeigen, in other countries probably similar). Ebay gets used less and less. They focused too much on commercial sellers. But they are going to the Amazon Market Place nowadays instead. A lot of stuff went wrong there. Look at their website userinterface. From time to time you still find stuff thats still in the design from 15 years ago, no joke. Riding eBay stock is like riding a dead horse.
ATHs today
Are there more ratings expected this week?
Why? Isnt it up 2% rn?
Oh damn, that's been creeping back to green. Didn't even notice!
94% effective for the 2 months that we had trials. Then in month 6, you grow a penis from your forehead. No from me dawg
Their marketing is abysmal I s2g
It's like synthetic CDOs but for vaccine news. The same information that was already priced in the previous rally, repackage it.
... and travel goes green again!
Don't forget a 1% day gives Bezos like an extra 10b

Cant find any news but a bunch of youtubers made content on PSTH over the weekend so could just be FOMO
They expect an announcement this week.
I was about to say this, I want my tendies and my calls not looking too fresh rn, aside from the 560 one
$30 minimum
30$
Yes
Hey boss. Looks like there's movement at the gates! Must be this week.

Fed vote on Wed.
It just had a pullback last week, today seems like the right time to get in. Holiday season digital sales should be pretty good.
How did you miss it? What a rookie.

I bought in at $20 and sold after it gapped down to like $13 on a random day in August.

Get rekt.
Its going to 500 by 1-2 years
the random $10 TLRY call I picked up last week is very lonely and wishes I had gone all in on it
Nyet! Canadian weed stocks are garbage.
PLTR
Whats the most lucrative out of these?
I bought multiple weeklies for those companies last Friday when I saw that spike. I'm liking where it's going so far.

Smart play is shares. IV will destroy you on options.
Shares and calls
Shares
Judging from past meme stocks itll rise quickly this morning
buy instantly
If it's not  within the next 1-2 hours then this is allready the dip. If unsure: buy first half at open and other half with the next dip whenever it is.
Normally it runs up at open and then dips..... but I honestly think this dip to 17 in AH is the best entry.  I think today is the day that the fomo goes nuts.
If youre going for super short-term gains I make my scalps a few minutes after open when the limit sells and swings sell off and I see it losing downward momentum and longer tails/buyback on candles. But Im just autist not an advisor
Which stocks 
What does your wife's boyfriend think?

Big balls.
I can't decide whether to load up today or hope that it does what it did last time and moon after earnings and then immediately collapse the next day.
What happened?

They're at the cusp of being bought up by S&P index funds at an unprecedented market cap with one catalyst after the next lined up to keep the fire stoked

Haters gonna hate on this one but I'm definitely getting in at open
How much further can this thing go.. its been on one hell of a run. I cashed out 10k profit at $8 thinking it was done back then.
It already jumped 50% on Friday. How much farther do you anticipate it jumping at this point in time?
Isn't today also the day he can sell off all his shares? One last pump and dump. GM probably in on it too.
The vaccine news like Moderna only being a week behind pfizer for FDA approval?

This is 100% accurate. Going to be at ATH very soon
best brokerage that offers leaps?
Happy kek day!
$20. Im just shares though
I'm getting out at $20, but it could moon up to $30.
Feels awesome to be above PDT requirements 

Or so Im told 
NKLA? Ya it's about to have it's face ground into the dirt.
Thoughts on their price today?
They are drilling hard right now. Wonder if its a trap or it will just keep tanking.
Yup. Literally transferred the last of my cash to my account to buy more TSLA & PLTR.
Watch it at open, Tesla usually pops in the first 5 minutes then jumps back down a couple% then itll continue to go up the rest of the day (if it goes up).
Prolly gonna dip first.
Its a swing until the 21st
Pay it forward

It always seems sus tho
It's a meme but there is truth to it.

Going to be so sweet rolling a wheelbarrow of worthless paper up to my bank to pay off my mortgage though
Im buying 100 $18 12/04 calls at open.
$100
Higher than you can sell it for 
It depends when you think the short squeeze is going cause GME to skyrocket. If your timeline is within the next 2 weeks, can't really go wrong buying in. If your timeline is over 2 months, you can probably find a better entry
Chinese risk off
Its up like 2,000% this year lol
Hype left.  


We cashed out and moved on to other stocks
Were unlikely to see more face ripping days unless something big gets brought up, but it will continue to be a slow burning rise. November delivery numbers will be out soon which will add some fire
Its still good, a lot more steady. Everybody just dropped their NIO toy for PLTR.
Good fuck them
Buy the rumor, sell the news.
and add an extra one on the end
Wouldn't be surprised if we get one 2-3 years from now.
it's falling to 15 today and below 10 by end of the week.
dude thats been over for a while. move on.
Dont give up too easily check their insider trades, the ceo bought a shit ton last week
such blind hype and sentiment I love it. those guys are missing even more chromosomes than this sub
He cant, still has to wait until tomorrow
Wow. Both are idiots.
But also don't forget to get out when it looks like things have peaked. We've seen this song and dance. There may not be time to catch the falling knife.

But for real I'll take an ACB moon to $25 or something.

Short story about that.  I worked in the Grocery industry for years.  I thought I was being funny by forcing a fart in my Manager's office in front of him before leaving and shutting the door.  It was a disappointing little pewt.  And then I was walking back to my department through the frozen food aisle... and realized that I had in fact sharted myself trying so hard to leave him a fart.
Tesla is not part of any indices so Tesla can drop even 50% in one session As it is trading at 1100 multiple of future earning 

US Probe on over 130,000 Tesla car over safety that is one quarter Tesla sales 

Thanks to Elon for everything
Wonder if still worth jumping in and out real quick
This is the litte turd that couldn't. I'll probably be saying the same thing in a few months when my March $25 calls are -99%.
They don't just sell CD's, they buy them too
Haha i feel that. The only moves ive made money on are to inverse whatever a normal rational person thinks. And to stay away from options until you have savings and arent throwing your weekly check at cheap ass calls.

When is that IPO, again?
Is it too late to buy in now?
none of is as autistic as we all are together
One can wonder who the real retards are.
It's like throwing pennies in a fountain for good luck
It's probably the mods
When you got dudes with 2k account buying calls worth 5% of their account value this is what you get.
There will.
Are you saying be careful going all Into tbe Thicc  ?
Watchu mean
When are you selling these calls? Or keeping them?

already free rolling that position, I hated having to buy into this pos but oh well
Shit hurted
They announced today they are actually beating their projected financials for the year. CRSR goes down.
EOW???

Right there with you bud
fuck this stock man it goes up like a morning wood and right when I decide it's time for me to get in, I get shafted

oh? where are you getting this from?
Sell low, buy high, thats the strategy
Dont think there was already a squeeze with the 34% raise in the past week?
Oof
calls on headshots
you got fucked in the ass by a bunch of baseball players in gym class?
Probably general China stock worries with trump adding more to the dont do business list and also this week House voting to delist Chinese stocks

Also I think Ant IPO got shelved till 2022

Gonna be painful
Nah, GME is a longer play, trying to trigger a sqeeuze after all.
Fax ?
$700 EOW
Dude it is almost up to FBs market cap. Buyer beware
Not even a dip lol. TSLA has been green all day.
Dilution. It'll work itself out in the next week or two.
I bought around 595 for 640c. Down about 200 but not sweating. No doubt this shit rockets all week again.
I only put $800 into puts last week, but already doubled.
Was shorting it at open but PM beat me to it.

Its a pos
What happened with their giga drop over the weekend. The dip is tempting for sure.

Edit: never mind they dead
APHA hasnt even seen the pre-earnings pump, legalization vote on Friday... its only Monday

Sell now retard

Nah buddy, you might be making emotional trades based off fomo or fogb (fear of going broke). Take a step back and use that brain of yours. Next one will be a good one. Draftkings is tasty still. 75c for Feb or march
Looool thats a very common feeling around here, what it is the algos got incredibly evil smart to cause the most harm to the autistic gang by sodomizing as many of us as they can. Well fuckem and fuck citron.....the key is dont get too greedy, if you want it all you will lose it all.
This happens to me every time I buy weeklies. If I buy weeks or months out I get blessed. For some fucking reason I'm still drawn to FDs
Needs to do something, been teasing me all morning.
Same. Even my CSIQ and QCLN are down today.
Eh, looks like a red day overall. Fuck.
Green tomorrow.

Buy PLTR
i got in at 15 im fine lol
Lost 9k but got out with 2k gains.
Yup, got fucked with both of these and still haven't learn my lesson....I need to keep my day job...or make an Onlyfans..decisions, decisions...
WHEN TO SELL A MEME STOCK? WHEN THE FRONTPAGE IS FULL OF MEMES OF SAID MEME STOCK
A plot device?
The seeing rock?
Yeah the fuck is up with that. Perfect timing.
MMs sweating
Exactly. This shit sucks to look at but my calls expire in 1/22, I can still make my money back and then some. Market is red, wait for positive vaccine news and PLTR do their role in that. Maybe they will drop some spicy news this week too. This separates the men from the boys here. Just not going to look at it for the rest of today.
Im not so sure that dip is done my friend
NGL it's annoying being at 86% on it instead of the usual 100% gain :/
This lol. People freak out as if its dying. It shot up a crazy amount
Loba main here 
APHA is carrying me so hard
This needs to takeoff cause my pltr has me royally fucked
i got out, tomorrow's vote is gonna motivate short buyers to get out bc of how far away the merger is, also theres a bunch of ppl with new accounts posting only ab THC B , it seems like a pump and dump to me
Bought a call before the fall 
First
Fuck them.
See you tomorrow
Based
Same. A ton of red
Sadness
TBF the entire market is down. Its to be expected some investors are cashing out gains. My guess is others will see this as a buying opp so Im gonna put away RH for today and not let the dips bother me; I bought a few more stocks today but Im ok with holding for a while. Everyday cant be green.
Diamond hands always win long term.
huge rally coming

hahaha I had to go watch that video again. lols
Honestly wait for another dip. Looks like 33 is the floor and well probably tickle it again, only thing is I have no clue when itll start to consistently go green again
Wait till 30 dude. I called that it would go below 35
Exactly my thoughts. Im tryna gauge what the right price to buy in at is. Part of me thinks its going to continue to deflate a little maybe down to 30. If it hits 31-32 around that area Im all in
MJ leaps are free money
just dipped outta PLTR and picked up a bunch of APHA. not planning to hold it too long tho
me too
Sold some nice covered calls.
IT GOT STUNG
I'm averaged in at 11.50 but bro we might be cooked
its not forever dead in your opinion?
Overbought
No fucking clue, just disgusting
Hospitals overflowing in a public health emergency?
Possibly the end of civilization as we know it
its the 730a dump, aint cha knowwww?
Nah not 7% maybe 3-4 though
Buy the dip, we battling the short sellers and paper hand pussies!
Yeah what the fuck
Got more to go
Because its down 8% since the market opened and everyone bought it
will end red. was up 20%
It's people who FOMO-d at 18-19 this morning lol
Ya but how else am I going to buy high and sell low like a retard?
40 seems aggressive (i'm holding some) but a rebound is inevitable for sure
yep there's too much hype in the retail market right now after this sub blew up last week. they are just putting us back in our place. great buying opportunity right here. discipline will be rewarded unless your are holding weekly FDs
What we buying?!
Same.. looking to pounce
And if it went woulda went up you would have been an idiot for not getting in at "that" all time high.
Always buy both lol. Puts were dirt cheap...

But still wouldnt mind my calls printing.
nothing to do with him

whole market is selling off. Profit taking

Dont worry. Just temporary.
Someone should hack his twitter and delete it.
Down 30%
because you don't have the awareness, confidence, or effort to make your own dd & decisions
PLTR is mirroring SPY DONT STRESS, HOLD IT
huh?
Nah this is just the start. Next two months gonna be bloodayyy
1.   Opec  meeting.  
2. That Iran thing. 
3.
You shall be graciously rewarded and in hindsight find your decision most enlightening.
Cringe
K shaped\*\* V shaped is for trump term. K shape is bidens term.
I went all in on PLTR calls when it was at like 25
I want to see the same comment but with NKLA just so I can laugh at it.
Thank you for ur service!
Bottom has yet to come
I got assigned on PLTR friday, and sold my remaining whopping 25 shares today, but added 200 more GME shares at around $18
Just bought more
bought the dip and quite happy about it bro. just wait merger
Youre a sucker
Im sorry little one... I sold you...
Same as ENGee mf always goes up premarket then acts gay all day long
agreed
I was sooooooo close to pulling the trigger...
Same for me. Shares though so I may have to hold a while and maybe DCA if I free up some funds.
Loooool why would u buy CRSR at 50

Awaiting launch
This... does put a smile on my face
Blow right through that shit
I took that L and sold. Might have to sit out but fuck losing money
You can still close positions if you have PDT.... just cant open new ones. Da fuk lol
YAAASSSSS
LEGGOOO BTFDDDD
Not scared of fed meeting tmrw?

Id cum so hard but I doubt it lol. Slow and steady
It hasn't happened yet keep holding on
K Shaped\*\*\*\*
Glad to know I wasnt the only one
I feel a bit dumb buying more shares at 32, when I already had like... 3000 shares below 24 (a ton at IPO)... then bought another 2k at 32, literally completely fucking my cost basis lol...  


But yeah, I believe in this company, when the stock is 50-60 I won't care lol.
GME
GME 
Why not all?
i just got in on the thiccness. still holding pltr. haven't been able to hit my entry on GME yet
I got out of thiccbee after being disappointed too many times 
There's been no official announcement... That being said I exited today bc I already locked in ab 40% gains and I don't wanna keep holding.
Chill its standing strong
Bet you got a shit option bud, how many days to exp
No one tell him
The whole market tanked and is recovering. Don't know what I missed.
well played
No
Diamond handing these calls and shares
I'm just chillin. Losing money, but chillin.
We die with the mothership

Lets go
 
Half shares... half calls. Not worried one bit.
Trevor Milton with his stock lock. He's holding 24% of the shares, as well as all the other early investors. Its why it never dipped under 17-18.
Fuck yes I did
Hahahah fr my calls hurt themselves in confusion
Its exactly behavior like this which makes me lose hope for our bonding relationship
Youll get to the point that it feels more like poker chips than money, and thats a good place to be. Its not that the money isnt real, but that emotional distance is important when youre trying to make money
I threw up every time i shoved a grand into calls... aVreging dOwn..
PAHMP EET!
Who tf is buying?
Yeah, but Theranos never rolled a blood test down a hill for a photo op. See? NKLA *is* innovative.
That's a slow/steady growth ETF
 Im still kickin bbb
Probably algos tbh. Or a stop loss raid.
Fuck that company
First of all.  Why you napping at market open on a Monday after a short trading week?  Step it up rookie.  Secondly, what strike?  We are about to go green and could see this thing pump to $30
no problem bro
Didnt know Tyreek Hill traded options

If youre holding you shares dont sweat over hour-by-hour changes man
Theyll be scrambling to get back in by EOW
Everyone that bought at 30 sold for some magical millionaire maker from GameStop today, I bought more on the PLTR dip bby
mfers still play that? Cold War the new wave bro. Unless u talking bout warzone
He can't cash out until tomorrow. The drop was because they suspended the Badger 'indefinitely' which means never. Just wait for tomorrow.

Yup it is coiling, but from the angle it seems like it would coil downwards or not
I'm too scared to do this but literally same
That's my new plan istg
wait until tomorrow
disgusting, this sort of degeneracy should have a NSFL tag
Now. Or you can risk missing out by waiting til after earnings next Tuesday.

I'm so excited about this too
Its still pre merger? Still a waiting game
we wait, as planned. December 3rd

What do you recommend tho
I was eyeing 12/18 $20p when nkla was over 30 last week and doubted myself and didnt pull the trigger. 
Bought some puts this morning when I read the news. I really don't think there's anyway this stock rises lol.

12/17/21 $40 checking in, i have supreme faith
I'm new to options but why not just buy shares if you're going for such a long exp date? from what i understood, the longer the call expiration the more premium you pay and the contract itself is more expensive.. but again i've never bought an option and english isn't my first language so maybe i'm just missing something.
TSLA just paid for my Tesla.
Good call honestly
I'm not a fan of the premiums for DKNG options as I feel like I can do more with the money in the nearer term, but DKNG leaps have looked like free money.
LETSGOOO
I feel you
Its just a game. Itll be alright :)
Don't do that. Things get worse before they get better. Fortune cookie advice, but uhhh, this too shall pass. Good vibes upon you
It's all good! It's a tough game... i suck at it too lol
Money is material life is permanent it'll be okay man stay strong <3 i bought nio calls at what was the ATH a couple weeks ago and lost mad money, but i've made a couple good plays and am almost at break even. Don't trade emotionally to try to make back your losses. Cut them and focus on the next play, and never risk more than you're willing to lose
Sir, this is a casino.

fine, was better in am
Dont know why anyone is expecting movement before any type of announcement.
Looks like that has occurred
We aint worried. Tesla has been up 40% since the announcement. Now its barely went down. I would say pretty much trading flat for the whole day. For a 40% run up, thats actually pretty promising. And the S&P is going to make an official decision on how to include the TSLA after hours.
I think Im going to hold for tomorrow
Going to sell half, bought near the lows today. 12/18 600
Sold my 12/18 125 when aapl hit 119.5 for about 100% profit. It was the obvious resistance so Im happy with it

Market is irrational. This stock is still massively undervalued. It needs another earnings report. They put out a positive press release today but it's not a popular stock for some reason.

Every major analyst out there gives CRSR a "buy" rating as of today.

This is a waiting game.
does this mean short sqeeee
Is there anyway to see the shorts expiries?
Double down easy
Full retard time
Double down I think
Good loading zone in my opinion. Sideways trading for a few days would be good for the longer term momentum into December.
dead
Bought Carnival last Thursday, but knowing me, Ill get bored of it and get rid of it for some meme stock FDs in a week or two
Idk Im looking at Uber or Fake Taxi right now
i bought in at $294...in too deep to pull out just yet
China/USA relations apparently 
how many times you gonna ask that?
30-45 DTE really is the play. If it moves against you right away drop it for a 10% loss. If it moves in your favor you make 10-50% easy quick. Much better then an FD that goes to -75% overnight if your pick gaps down and then you have no choice but to try and fight to Expiry just to hopefully break even.
Exactly...more of the map to the moon for us.  Uppity up ^up.
Same here I have a 585/590 spread... well I bought 4 of them.
Hubba bubba max!
Stocks cooling down after tremendous green velocity. Just hold your plays
APHA
HYRE calls 1/15.
Th sea 
I went green energy Jan and March calls
Small dip
PLTR!
LMT, RTX, etc
Gme
DFEN
Jets
I played. Not on the dip but got in
I'm just happy I didn't sell all of my AAPL calls a while ago. I did sell my January calls for 80% loss, still holding my leaps
AMD calls on that juicy ass dip this AM, was the play of the day.
AMD took off today as well.
Good time to buy calls now

GE?
WSB is not pumping a $2T company
Apple been stag for awhile. I can see it run up a bit
Whats he saying?
What if its not
Which stocks you buying?

Looking at Shopify and Snow
Zm crushes earnings but has bleak outlook.  Does this support your hypothesis?
But earnings dont mean fuck all right now.
i also only get in a stock after its up nearly 4x
How are you only up 55% if you bought that at open?
Ive been dead inside for years.
Lmao have you read this thru this thread throughout the day? You dont
don't fucking yolo everything on options and make small increments like a good little boomer
Depression
You dont
You wont need to if you learn to buy the dip. Thats literally what separates good traders from shit ones
Did I take profit? Then I have no reason to be that mad at myself. Of course there are exceptions but this game is can be played by anyone, so a win is a win.
Never trade when youre bored. I should take my own advice
Still an entire hour of trading
Passed. Almost Brk.A.
That would be like a 2900% increase
Yeah two analysts raised target to $130...all you need these days to make the market cum in its pants....
Someone raised their price target to $190 or something
I said the same thing months ago.. and its gone up since then
Everyone sold and FOMOD into APPL
not long buy
forever... fuck that terrible company for real.
60? Are you out of your mind? It was at 25 last week. Do you really think Salesforce will pay that much?
This is so fucking retarded I just bought in.
Lmao. This isnt going to $130. Im an AAPL leap holder: this thing is going to fall back down to its $115 to $117 channel
Wonder what calls you have.......
Delta hedging starts at $120 for MM, at that level they must buy more to hedge, at least thats what Im told.
I mean that makes perfect sense. But this market makes no sense so this would likely lose me money. 

Im not jumping in so you may be safe. GL
Bet she still lookin fine af

Chill b we good
130m is higher tha avg
This is the truth
This is the way
So my 364cs for Wednesday are safe?
Whats the news?
Brad Pitt?
Thic
I was gonna help the poor, but then I got high. I was gonna improve peoples lives, but I got high.

Now Im jacking off, to their data... because I got high, because I got high, because I got high...
My average on shares is 11, bought calls at 10
650 shares @ 17.18 (avg), holding for the moon!
16APR21 20C, holding until I can buy a PS5 from game stop.
I bought shares at the top this morning at  $18.88 like a retarded retard. I'm holding it until at least breaking even.
Holding it until earnings. $30c 1/8/21
Shares & 12/31 21c's - will hold till right before X-mas
Whats the move man? Im sweating bullets here

Oh right. The move is hold
you should be fine as long as you didn't get in at 600+
Shorts stirring up FUD so they can cover with less loss :)
God damnit for the 100th fucking time  is going to pay off for sure dude me and a lot of other longtime traders did DD on it just hold the shit for a week or 2 god damnit, whatever its your loss If you have paper hands
Just shorted 20k. I think they are priced to perfection and can only disappoint
Puts.

I'm nervous about my $125 Calls I be selling.
That $190 price upgrade....
Where can I find penny stock f@gs
Boring day after first 30 minutes of trading ffs
Last time I said that i lost 2000$ of profit but yes that is correct
YUP.  Weird too, price going down a bit but my calls gaining value...
Im still hoping for 290 in two weeks Patna
Jesus u r not happy with 50 percent gains u retard
Me with JD exactly.
So has every other stonk. Market is flat AF today.
Debating jumping here but it looks a bit priced up on hype today tbh. Might chill for now
Grabbed one 590 for the ride!  I'm either up 100% or down 99% in the morning
530pm today
Why
Yeah, me too.

Too expensive
Only the real low functioning retards.

Oh you mean you can do things other than options?!?
Today is a great day to buy shares
try not to be always 2 weeks late
[deleted]
Still incredibly bullish in the mid to long on this company. Their products, Gotham and Foundry, are hands down the most advanced data analytics platforms in the world.

hope u did not fomo in at $607  
I just did 
Lol no
Its going back up to new ATH soon chill out man
I was freerolling this one since an early win.

Three things moved against the position this week, the market, ccp allowing Tesla to sell, and the US looking into more oversight into ccp companies listed in the US.

So my plan is to enter again in a week when I hope its down to 40ish
low volume
You'll recover in AH
What the fuck do you think
Only the paper hand boys lost money. Paper losses only exist in our tiny brains.
$248k on Friday, down to $230k at close today

$220k at the bottom today though so im not complaining.
Flat as fuck.
My calls would like that
Not if you are a GME holder!  People that bought at the top are hurting, but it'll go back up soon enough.  GME always goes up long term.
Here but scared. Gap up to 600 would be perfect.
zm is fucked
idk but my sell order on SPY $263 C went off 2 seconds before the market closed
Blame the CCP
RIP. I don't think it's done yet sadly
BABA and Candy... fuck me... everything else was nice and green.. still lost 13% on the day
Me too boo! Sadge.
Same here bro... was fortunate enough to get some good outs but man never touching a Chinese stock again.

Honestly if you think it's overpriced you probably shouldn't. Getting in at a price you don't trust leads to paper hands.
buy shares and wait for +10000% gains
Any buy at market order under 40 is good deal. We going to 90
inverse WSB and buy puts

Time to refuel the ship

Same for me
Retard
You didn't loose money if you don't sell
If only..

*sad account noises*
LOL, that makes no difference to 80% of PLTR owners in this sub. They are trading options with expiration dates. They cant wait it out
Well done mate
congrats and fuck you

Nice! What's your position?
Bought 15 26c 1/15/21 at the bottom, up over 1k
Like a wise old man***
Im hovering over the button. Got stopped out at 24.8 not sure if it will dip that far again
2:30 eastern I heard
Ya wheres that guy today? Id like to ask him a few questions when he told me even $100 a share would certainly not be retarded
Yeah
Thanks
Thanks, it took my mind off of LGVW for a minute.
This is the way
any minute now
Goddam my toilet paper hands. Least I bought back in at 26
Nice. I'm back in after selling everything Friday.

$40c 1/15/20

Better than my 44c 12/4
I love how they doubled down after the hindenburg report, saying that they did their due diligence.  LMAO.
Not if you don't sell like a pussy.
Nope
no, hold
Youre fine just hold until April
Depends how long youre willing to wait imo
Shares? No. Give it a week or two.
dude chill, it will go back up, just need some time
Priced in
Why the hell would he?

Death threats and killing tigers....
This is true
Lmao you havent met Apple before have you? That boomer stock has heavy chains. Youre gonna hate treading that water
I have a sell order for my call at 119.5 call me retarded
Tards have moved on. Autism
Dude, just buy both

Use both the retard strength and actual strength from both 

You shouldn't hate on one or the other IMO
what about TLRY ? I just bought some calls - please provide me with honest opinion. Thanks!

What are we holding til
Right?? Im bored lol
I sold AAPL January calls at an 80% loss a couple of weeks ago. Thankfully I still have my June calls.
here
Might take a small hit if it doesnt pass, but overall no. Undervalued as it is even without legalization. Analysts have a current value at $11 to $12 last time I checked. Good DD post just popped up on here a couple of hours ago as well outlining the bull case. Search for it if youre interested.
No, it's doing extremely well within the Canadian market.
It's decriminalization, not legalization, being voted on.
also my 1/15 20C success 
Theyre a Canadian company, where its legal. This is helpful to its price point but they will still be doing business in Canada and states where its legal.
Its gonna tank now cuz I bought in with all you retards
It's up 9% on a day when the indexes are either down or sideways. Was up as high as 17% this morning. Relax.
hold! dont selll. much good news to come my friend
No
New gaming consoles, earnings upcoming, short squeeze impending.
People are holding GME hoping for a 10 bagger. If you didn't believe in that, why did you even jump on? Everyone said not to buy FDs, this is gonna be a long and bumpy ride to the moon.
Me... but also not me
Came close.
yep im holding on for dear life
People already do this im huge cities. Air BNB doesnt own houses just like Uber doesnt own cars. 
Are you enjoying your Great Reset yet?
The entire reason they have such amazing margins is because they don't have to pay for real estate and the maintenance of it. Buying property ruins their profit model.
Airbnb wouldnt buy homes tho. They have very little incentive to do so. Its much easier to be the middleman between owner and renter than to be the owner and have to deal with all the extra nonsense and liability that comes with home ownership
its like this in every european capital city.
One of the largest downsides of AirBnB is that they could very well get regulated to hell for this very reason.
Airbnb was a huge catalyst over the last couple years for rising prices in major cities due to speculators and "entrepreneurs" buying homes just to rent out. Not the only catalyst, but there's research you can Google. It's already happened
SAB & BTFD
FR
Oh come on bruh why you gotta bring God into this degeneracy.
Yup
Seriously
Nah fam buy the top 

This is the way
Its been going up $1-$2 every day for a week. 20+ tmr
$1B cap and 144% short float, if it gets momentum its a powder keg. Thats why I did, anyway.
Because youre smart and itll go up
Because every idiot and their mother was telling this thread it'll be $500 in the next 2 hours.
Peer pressure
The only bee that goes brrrrrr instead of bzzzzzzz
Saved
If youre still handling PLTR, youre trying to lose money.
Yeah PLTR isn't looking so good right now in Europe
shut the fuck up you gay bear
thats shit abt to take off again
i'm near positive that shit is gonna sink today and probably through till thursday just because that's how citron has ruined several of my short term plays at this point
What rumor
rocket still fueling.  You will know when it launches.
GME just getting started
shut up and buy GME
To be clear, we are talking about a vaccine that already at least 40% of Americans will refuse due to a belief that it contains nanotechnology created by bill gates.

Get fucked retard.
Then get out lmao
Blame yourself for listening then retard
oh wow, I am surprised you're surprised lol
Sorry about your shitty impulse control, hope you get better
If you actually listened to this sub the past 3 weeks then PLTR calls were free money. How you ended up losing money is on you retard
Same, when everyone from 18 year old tik tokers to grandmas were yelling about pltr fomo, you know its time to sell
Chargeeee
V ^all ^the ^way ^up
Held shares, loaded up on 25c weeklies at just below 25

Buy the dip
Buy buy buy

BTFD. You know the way.
BUY BUY BUY BUY
Yes and all the retards will think it went up 400% over a day
Not happening, the momentum is gone and too many bag holders this week desperately trying to escape
RemindMe! 1 year
How you figure this??!
This is the last dip. Hitting 25 this week before earnings and only god knows what next week
Lets fckn goooooo I dumped all my $$ into GME.. lets goooo
Not even close
You dacuck
Watching this is frustrating. I dont know if its retail dumps or shorts manically trying to keep it down. Whichever it is, its effective.
It wont be VW since the majority of the shares arent concentrated at one specific holder, multiple institutions own a certain %
"shorts can evacuate easily"?!  with over 100% %) (maybe up to 140of the outstanding shares shorted?!
when you say "retail" what are you referring to?
I'm pretty new to reading charts, but it looks like on today's bars, every dip has been bought so far? 

Or am I reading it wrong?
      
What stock is that
Question I ask myself about NIO every night
35 at least
you thinking 600 EOW?
Watch it go up now , 1pm pump baby
And nothing much to show for it

I imagine the 120 mil vol was mostly the -10%+ cyber Monday/Citron dip being bought/sold. And also the vol is still relatively low to where It was last week

Poots on the menu
Bullish af in this market
Does this mean it's going up or down?
yep this.
Shares are rallying but warrants are not. :(
Its consolidating and then shooting right through the moons asshole
This.
No theyre not. But retards who listened to them will.
Shorts in panic trying to throw some water to the fire
Im so fucking hard rn let it die until open plz so I can get in
Nope. The squeeze starts when shorts have had enough. That could be $25, $30, $40. Who knows.
PLTR needs to open at like 20% just for most of this sub to break even.
BRRRRRR
I was in gme at $8 but was new to trading. Now I look back and wish I went long on calls it was a no brainer at the time
It will close green thats all that matters. As long as PM remains the same I have no worries

Was literally up 15% 10 mins ago haha
I think that lockup is over today too.
I think he will be fine. All the suckers that bought nkla on the other hand. He gets to dump billions of stock today
If PSTH lands stripe it will be the visa/MasterCard of the internet and be trading in the 200-300s
PSTH bill ackmans spac that multiple billionaires are already pouring into. Theres speculation that they will be merging with stripe or some other company in q1 of 2021. the stripe founders started following some PSTH groupie on twitter after he started possibly putting the pieces together so it added to the speculation.
Its GME 
At least your spread of both calls and points isnt fucked
It's my first time playing TSLA since Musk did us dirty with that AH tweet on Battery Day Eve. I bought 1 600c 12/4 on friday morning. I wanna win on this.
My weekday ritual
Never too late
Youre only 45% up late.. sure thing
Spoiler: It will.
You can still dive in not too late
I know man, SO MANY doomsday fuckers out there.
Not sure if this is a joke due to my lack of coffee, but the stock has been going up in pre-market?
See, NKLA is a meme stock. Complete bogus. Nothing good going for them.

PLTR on the other hand, real profits and promising numbers. Tech & Software.
You got time to get into Ave Point
Lithium batteries for cars. Money from VW and Bill Gates. TSLA co-founder and VW guys on the board.

You know that saying when theres a gold rush, get in the pick and shovel business?

Shares
Na shares or April and later calls
Shares yo
Shares and calls. But shares are a must. Gotta drive the shorts out.
Shares, but remember to put ridiculously high calls on them so they can't be lent out for Puts
if i was a peasant charlatan and only got to cash out on millions instead of billions i'd still be happy. The man deserves nothing-- he's still gonna get rich off of this bs so he should just shut up and take it and hope he doesnt go to jail for nutting on his underage cousin or whatever
Milton going to be where Elizabeth Holmes is in about a year.
What announcement?
What was the IV though?
Buy dont miss. Out
I bought right at 0700
Not about weeklies or puts, it's retarded plays. You gotta analyse and know when to buy/sell. Otherwise you're a retard like the rest of us.

All are welcome aboard the GME train. There is a long journey upward ahead of us.
He's going to get investigated if he even looks at his shares now. It's the other investors that haven't sold a thing that will be truly fucked.
He's going to need the money for all the lawsuits, SEC action, and criminal proceedings he will be fighting off in the future.
Spoiler: Yes.
I'm in on this myself
By looking at their PE I think they are some high tech company with great margins...
I have been struggling with how to play this stock. Makes me nervous.
Fuck I sold my $55c on Friday and it didn't dip enough for me to get back in because I am a cheap asshole and thought I could get the calls even cheaper 
Triple down bro that shit is going to print so hard.

For the guy writing those calls, not for you however
LOL bro that thing is already fucking worthless, good luck finding someone to buy it
Bears only come out when the markets are closed.
it's about time
News came out at 8.
Could be selling to lock in gains/losses and avoid the lock up ending tomorrow.
Which tickers are you looking at?
They always come out of the woodwork at night when everyone else has better things to do. 10pm Bear circle jerk is real.
Kinda like PLTR buyers early Friday morning imo
Hope it continues to die.
Yeah the new legislation won't effect baba, can't talk for less audit-able chinese companies
Called this last night but got downvoted
Yes average down whenever you can.
Oh course.
If I didn't already have some I'd try to scalp a few percent
Who's that?

I think I sold him those puts lol
Yes. Grabbing $250s at open. Zoom beat will cause them to run
Killing me. Im up 59% on my 2/19 calls and about to give it all back
Why did it drop? Wtf happened?
Does anyone know if the Stripe rumor is true? All I have seen is some really good, but still speculative, DD.

The market isnt even open yet
12.56% now!
Sell
I've been seeing it for a while now, I bought 60 shares at 4.74 a few months back. I'm very pleased rn, PLTR on the other hand has been a disappointment.
Ryan Cohen is trying to use Gamestop's image to takeover digital gaming industry. Sort of like Amazon but just for games. He sees that alot of people still rely on gamestop for their gaming needs so he wants to close unnecessary stores in europe that keep losing money. Also Gamestop's balance sheet looks hella good which makes it a good buy in general. Also its market cap is higher than most other comparable industries that have the same market cap but the stock price sits at a lower price because of recent fall from the pandemic.
Yeah boi 
Gme signed a deal with Microsoft to get $ from each online purchase made on Xbox. Thats huge. Also with the CEO of chewy buying out the company soon its going to pivot its growth into E commerce

Yes, my dick is ready

People panic selling because they think of whats going on with BABA affects NIO
PLTR is just getting started
Me too man
CRSR is worth around $30. I have been stating the correction has one more day (today) before it can find support.
Big rip
idk what to do with my CRSR :(
same. what's the plan? do you think it will correct?
Wow, if only there were some way for you to check IV before buying... oh wait
literally bought 1,000 at 18.90. I want to fuck myself but I remember I bought 2,500 at 14.00 so it's not as bad
Imagine not selling after the promotional video having a the vehicle rolled down the hill for it to look as it works, because he doesn't have a single running truck, and never was going to
lol what a surprise
In statements today, GM said it will sell fuel cells to Nikola for its electric semi-truck, but it omitted any mention of its abortive September agreement to engineer a pickup truck for the startup. At the same time, Nikolas shares also plunged after Nikola said it will be canceling the electric Badger pickup.
Time to buy leaps?
If it hits 35 yea
No one
Really trying to pump the highest market cap company in the world?

Definitely bearish

Cfd's? Never done them but isn't that our alternative?
I'm probably just going to hold. They freaking updated guidance. what the hell is going on lol
Support at high 20's, sell now and buy back in.
Sell I think everyone who was chasing the FOMO has paper hands. Most think I can still have profit if I sell now. Remember bulls make money pigs get slaughtered.
Look at you little day trader
What was your exp?

Bears r fuk
I think it's called dopamine, and it why you keep coming back.

Kinda like how you suddenly need to take a shit when you head out to buy a pack of smokes.
Then it all goes away when it stops 5 minutes later
I laughed hard
True but its already been hyped
What stock went down 10% today  thats a meltdown dont touch that shit
Agreed. What are you eyeing?
Just went balls deep in GME $16C 16Apr2021
Morning star gave it a 13$ true price with a 1 star. You cant always listen to experts but if it dives again I wont be stuck holding this loss.
Who are you talking to?
Down 1k. Thought i was buying the dip as usual.
its up 15% what dip you talking about lol
Morning dip after a long holiday. I bought at 595 and have no sweat over it.
Nah we just hanging out.
Literally the most boring stock in the history of stock
Be careful - the Ant IPO may not happen in 2021
But I thought booming economy and don't worry housing is red hot?????
The market is red?
Bitches be sellin
Because PLTR knows you are holding positions and wanted to give you a big fuck you.
Happy birthday I got you some losses 
We moving to GME
Because Andrew Left finished his cuckold session with his wife's boyfriend and decided to slap on some short shorts.
Just a red day in general and slight pullback from citron. I'm just waiting for a good buy in point today. I sold Friday morning
Are you new here?
buncha kitties with paper paws
You need to
Just hold - we're going back up.
This is actually the EXACT day to buy it. I dont want in once its already up 3%...
Wrong day to buy anything. We're at ath

Almost fucked with puts. Glad I watched the prices and was like nope this doesnt make sense
Nah GME is just the new fancy pump and dump

Just hold.

I mean it's still green which is good considering how red the entire market is rn
What should I do for breakfast, and also: where can I find an Xbox series x?
Yeah, Im not worried
Lol I can only take -5%
well....the one stock I chose to short (zoominfo) was up today lol. smh smh. Should hopefully go down tomorrow due to end of lockup period.
tsla!
No
I doubled my position on the dip, first quasi-yolo. here we gooooo
Buy high sell low. It's low now. So sell
Yes, this is a common pattern of first red day. The second is usually a red day as well. Its normal. Relax
No your phone is the wrong way turn it upside down
Look at the indexs...smh
Why
you got it
It doesn't look like a bottom yet...
PLTR is down today probably because of EOM sell-off. Wait until tomorrow to make a decision. A lot of us are still in and won't be leaving at least until tomorrow
Re enter we gotta refuel
both
There will always be a next meme. That's for sure.
My fault, I bought a call today
Lmao F
More sellers than buyers
I mean either becuase its a no-big-deal normal adjustment or its the beginning of the huge drop thats been overdue for months. Either way we shouldnt be surprised. 

Not a bear just realistic
HELL :/ 

Help

I was waiting for the dip, bought then dip showed. fml
Teach me
Been saying that for months. Like clockwork. 
Has spy retraced all the way yet?
You had a whole month to buy GME when it was at \~$11 and you just bought now at the top. Retard.
Yup and they make up 90% of my GD SHIT AHHH 
preach
Just look at the entire market man, almost everything is undervalued now
No, short squeeze won't happen until there's a fundamental change in the company such as a buyout or sustained growth. This is speculative buying hoping for that change that will cause a short squeeze.
It's AAPL, retard.  
Also, Roll motherfuckin' Tide!
Its barely holding on green bruh..
Could you imagine. Id happily lose money to see that
Dean, you speak too much sense at all times. Get your popcorn and enjoy the carnage 
This is why stop losses are a bad idea.
We have been going up for weeks. Correction is both healthy and needed at this point.
Lol market has mooned non stop this was inevitable
could be mutual funds re-balancing
have room for two?
ENPH
Looks like a sale today, anything
The prophet
This gives me so much joy :) No more palantards posts every 2 seconds. Not to mention my puts :)

you only fuck with liquid leaps...
Great now I'm a father
Whats dipping?
Weed is always green
Which tracker for copper you looking at? Serious question
Double down, no way it goes much lower
Institutions is my only guess
Lol look around
The faster they rise, the harder they fall. I knew a start up gaming platform couldn't keep that momentum going forever
Holding
I feel attacked
Everything dipped though? Lmao
Roger, roger
This is retarded advice.
CRSR will be $100 per share by end of 2022, imagine not buying this dip
four lettered word goes with that
I was staring it down too
they released a statement saying they bet their objectives today. it's a  very solid semi long term play. don't sell if you have
That makes two of us, good job.
inverse what you plan on doing from now.  free money
F
Priced in
This is a genius bet. I'm in on that
Buy the dip? Let it slip? Incoming rip?
Whats the play? Im new and retarded as fuck
3 years away, meh
Think youre a genius tbh. Good luck sir.
Username checks out
I hope to one day never think about RKT again
Its just the rockets red glare.
Cuz of all the august bag holders.
Wendys 4 for $4
Uber to unemployment line
Taco bell.
if you really want lottery yolo, you could to weekly expiration OTM NKLA calls in hopes of NKLA doing a proper deal with GM (expires on 12/3)
i bought in at $95.20
No you!
No double dipping!
Every stock had a reversal like that around the same time
Cut your losses!
Needs to turn green today please
i dont feel sorry for paper hands
It was almost me lol, bought my first TSLA option, this shit is crazy
What news??
yes and no
355-56
TSLA ~~green~~ +10% by noon
Plz
Thats assuming a lot like the vaccine works the same in everybody and there isnt a vaccine that does that.  If you are obese, metabolically challenged having an impaired immune system no vaccine works as well if injected into a healthy person.  No one talks about it.
Good job
What strike price?
What'd you get and for how much
They banned me for not talking about pltr
Deadass
Drill Team 6, entry point is open. I repeat, entry point is open
Ouch!
You bought the fear
lmao, Its been on my watchlist forever even though I haven't traded it in months, accidentally clicked on it just now, now that was a dip to buy
lowest of lows?it has barely lost 1 week of gains.
I got shook out of half my weeklies on the dip. Fuck my TP hands.
Yes sir!
I'm still bagholding my AAPL longs from just after the split.  22 150Cs, still down 40%.
Just 5 second boners here and there
What date?
Their dips always get bought up
Youll be kill
I dont even think thats a meme stock. Theyre a damn good company. I only buy AMD chips. Same performance as intel and way cheaper
I bought the fuck out of that dip
Balls deep in CRSR, hope it works out

Edit: when entering the price I did a typo and bought at 39. Idiot.
Woah thats big
The very next trading day after my 86c were forced to sell -80% after bag holding for 2 months. FML 
$ZM puts
Okay name three 

(No legit I have no idea what I'm doing pls explain)
don't you mean bear fags?
Sell that shit and buy shares

There is never anything wrong with selling green
you only have one of them? otherwise sell half and let the rest ride
Sell and buy shares with half the profit
HOLD THAT SHIT YO
Sell it and buy shares
I wish I could keep adding to this company. Long term, huge buy.

Impressive given it was down more than $4 at one point.
Do both its happening soon
I was but then I started making money
yea i fantasize about my mom all the time
Wait, this isnt the femdom sub?
Tim has been flirting with $120 for months now. No movement.
Amd be like I want to join the taste of breaking aths
APHA
Buy BABA
Acb for a short swing
Very bullish on AMD but just look at chart if we break 92 Id be very tempted to load up on 86 short dated puts.
AAPL 120c leap
4 shares of tesla
Yeah never again
Bought a $1 call when it was 30 cents.

I'm satisfied.
Merger might be coming Dec 2nd.
Donnie
$20
So true I was looking at it at $20 and was like I need to cycle back to this ASAP and then got tied up GL

And spelling
Most of the time*
What's that WB quote?  Stock market is basically a mechanism to take money from the impatient and give it to the patient.
Yes
Depends on how much it's shorted. Thankfully, GME is shorted >100%. 9-10x avg daily volume to cover.
38
30 or 20.
$27 in order to fuck over as many options traders as possible. Then we descend or hike up.
Its really volatile right now. Once bearish news is past And People realize the world isnt ending Itll go up. I say 35 to 40 but depends if it consolidates for a bit
Where its at now
Except CRM, fuck
Someone should tell BABA that
Jeff all the way.
Actual cage match or stonks?
Because they deserve it
Dunno. No news.
Needs to tickle 92.50. Could tank after that or break ATHs, who knows.
Black Friday sales?
down 5k on baba calls :/
$180
Wakanda forever
\*Nigerian Princes\* yes
Why wont it stop dying
Same play!
More like stagnant for another 6 months like it did in the 80s
110c
As is Citron tradition.
Its lunch time
Everyone forgot about stimulus. If we get some news this week damnnn
Yes 100%+ insane growth in a week is not healthy, pullbacks are good in the long run
is that a good thing or a bad thing.  bust a nut implies will go soft soon after, so that must mean you're bearish, eh?
Not gonna lie I bought a 20c just for fun.
1/21?  Doesnt exist
Cup with handle spotted
Bought mine early. Up 725% right now.
Lets hop aboard 
3c 12/18 just put $100 on it
Weedbee
My dick is rock solid
Whats the news I bought leaps for no reason like 2 months ago. Forgot I even had them
Where is the ceiling?
Lol I used to bang ts out of Chinese college girls on Momo 
Tengo hambre

Sold some last week but still have one call left. Feeling optimistic
Probably wait till at least after this week, the new Bill House is passing might give it more downward pressure
How far out are your leaps?
why ?
Lmao. I dont even care if my shares get called away...this little bb is the only thing keepin me alive 
400K shares, went from 5 figures to 6 this morning
I dunno but don't Jinx it
Its insane to me that people are not buying Amazon right now honestly.
It's bull
no get in here there still room on the rocket.
No today would be a really good day. IV only rising from here till earnings.
not yet. shorts usually cover on Thursdays, so itll go up more later this week
Girl Boss shits on Intel
they make computer parts. good ones. also they supply ps5 and xbox.
Im all in its next meme deadass
i'm holding
Goldmine!
I sold 57  15/21 95C with a $3 ave for slightly over break even a week ago. Fuck
RIP. Switch your broker man. Buying options without day trades is gonna get you killed
You were up 100% but didn't sell because of PDT . . . . .

No wonder you're broke
Aawhh
Tesla is the one stock I would never buy a put in. Sell your shares and calls to buy the dip sure, but never buy a put. That bull will give you the horns
Who the fuck would keep working if you can make more trading?
Well theres also no red days at work.
If my losses are gains, ya
im retarded what do you think
U think I make money trading?
Depends on the day.
Neither
Trading. So I quit.
I can day trade, now if you can tell me when its gonna go up and when its gonna go down, that would be super.
If you bought into a company who doesn't have shit, and relies 100% on the mercy of 1 company then O don't know what to tell you.
NKLA has no product. Complete sham
My entire life is riding on Dec 4 20p rn...
2022?
Is what I need. Got some strangles, IV crush is my friend.
thats a rip van winkle nap

lol i recall a guy here at earnings thinking it was gonna jump from 8 to 10...ha that would take three years
rumors - google it
No... you did right. Buy first, ask later.
I do also wonder WTF when that happens and then I remember...
How much
I want to know too. I'm up 20% but I'm out of day trades so I can't touch it until tomorrow and I hope it stays like this
Weed stock
They still have a bunch of cash I guess
This. At least list the ex-dividend date
Robinhood should make it easier to track ~~dividend payments~~ literally everything
Literally the greenest industry rn but people talking about GME
PLTR
Apha

APHA. Theres been good DD on it posted.
APHA
Aphria
APHA. Its up but has plenty left to go. Id stay away from Sundial
crlbf
0 days are always theta bun options though
Csrs News?
I am LOL but cuz Im $9000 in
yes, but u can sell, ill buy them!
I sold 12/4 40 because if it hits 40 Ill be happy either way, and if not then Ill lower my shares cost. It could go to 50 this week but thatd be nuts
Sell way out of money weeklies
Sell at a higher strike price. Youll make less premium but youll be safer
Bruh watch a youtube video and sell a way OTM strike.
Do it OTM and with a huge distance out, thinking February
Are you serious? If the calls are covered you already own the stock...
Same, bro. I don't feel so good.
You think itll go down?
All in Tilray!
this
Sold 306s a few moments ago.
I put $1000 on SPY 362p at open, sold a little less than half for $1700 and holding the rest to watch it go to 0.
Yes sir
I got out this morning after numerous disappointments
I'm asking the same... The op who did the DD said that it might take a week or 2 so that's my only hope. So far we're still up but not as big as we hoped. Could be worse...im frustrated waiting  too
Nah, we're gonna sell off now, despite all signs indicating that this will take some time, and then FOMO back in after it takes off.
Holding until I die
Damn, and people loved rattling off "ROKU makes you BROKU" about a month ago.
Complete idiocy. True.
285 to 275 to 288 in 3 hours. 
Who are you?
Why are they down is this China Stock ban thing legit?
Pinky promise?
Easy 8 EOY. Possible double digits.
Congratulations! Quite the climb
Was up 50%. Waited.  EV came back.  Now barely up 15%
Just go short on value stocks. They always are red
It's better to be a theta bear. You never go full bear
yes
i did sorry
Bout damn time.
Not If you are buying these dips. Grabbed 21 contracts on today's dip at 359. 16 for 363 and 5 for 361 Calls expiring Wednesday already up almost 60%.
No, you suck... I'm the best.
thank you for your sacrifice
15 jan 22 C gang
I had a handful of 4c and 5c 2022 calls earlier this year and sold for 50-100% gains.

lol fuck
Whats crsr
As it goes red, lol
and spy will continue to rise...this literally means nothing
Impossible, the United States government would never mislead their citizens.
Isnt that the like 3rd time its happened lol
Will pass the house, dead after that
No way. Mexico might pass, US got prob a year my guess. I got APHA and YOLO calls but no way.
Will probably pass the house without question and along party lines. Near 100% that McConnell will not even let a vote come to the Senate floor.

It will still be pretty bullish because it's legislation that really hasn't come close to passing and would send a signal that if the Dems take the Senate in the Georgia runoffs that they'll legalize pot. It becomes a real possibility in early 2021 if these seats somehow flip blue.

It helps that the whole 'The election is rigged' narrative is leading republican voters in georgia to not bother.
Doubt it but it should be a fun ride up 
Mara raging today!
Same here, IV is crazy low on these.. Feel like small cap tech is a great bet for the recovery. Its been consistently outperforming SPY/QQQ for a couple weeks now. No liquidity is the downside but Im gonna try to get out if we see a small IV spike once my Mar 30c gets in the money
Yes
Jan 15 29c
Applebees has rats!
You must be new here. This is where you come to lose money.
Jwn, PCG
Bought 12/31 50c
You are correct.
Thats just wrong
YEP
Positions? I went 4/16 $26c
They expecting to smash it?
Theyre going to crush. Im excited for them to have a chance to sell the purchase of Slack to investors too. I bought some last Thursday and am tempted to buy more EOD today, but market doesnt like the news as of now so i dont want to pretend like Im know something it doesnt....
He's the guy at the party that nobody really knows how they got invited, and everyone else assumes he must be someone else's friend. Nicky will eat the boot at the end of the night, no worries.
bought a shitload of 20p. If Milton sells off tomorrow it's over.
Too much bad news on top of bad news, I cut mine loose for a 30% loss at open, would have been more if I'd held
BABA wont be okay until mid December. I learned that the hard way two weeks ago
MSOS
-96 so you dont get to -99
-3000%
thought we were always yoloing
I need to start taking profits at anything higher than 50% instead of waiting until it expires
just took my baba calls at -99%
Hold a bit longer, especially during the first week of December
Hold on to em, till EOW atleast..
Wait are you serious or trolling ?
Hows it looking?
That guy is a fuck. Its the decision on how the shares will be bought.
can confirm.
Yes January the earliest, this is what shouldve always been the move
Why RIOT
Look at your portfolio
No. Do it
DO it
Congrats on the 2% gains? See u tmrw when GME goes up another 10%
$20 is going to be a step stool when the squeeze starts.
Sure are
Fruit is healthy, doing it for your wifes taste buds
(Dec 11 282.50c) u think we fucked bro?
If you have calls sure. But shares on margin? MSFT always does this. Flat for months and then moons. It will catch up to AAPL one day
T A H I T I Arthur
Picked up two jan 115c w my tsla earnings today. Gonna just hold em. If you think aapl aint breachin that ath sometime soon, then ya aint black!
12/31 140/145/150 and Ill let them ride.
Its being a wanker today, flat line EOD
This sounds solid.
why u say dat?
Still going mate!
Do it
Bro, do it. 
What's the ticker?
Open ur mouth let me breathe my stinky Cheeto breath into ur lungs
Glad I sold puts instead of buying calls this am.
Why buy low when you can buy high?
It's being suppressed and trying to shake out weak investors.
The original agreement was just for them to take $2 billion in stock from NKLA. At the time that seemed like a good deal. They wanted in on that sweet EV startup money.

I don't think they knew it would blow up in their faces.
Ffs finally. I swear MMs are just bouncing between which stocks they wanna pump
Worst play ive made in months
 :(
Just feels right
I see we have the same strategy
 AMD and Apple are doing pretty well
Dont bother trying to help these idiots let them buy at the top AGAIN
You got bailed out, just whatever you do dont keep it below 100 again
Ride for a little longer Imo, apple is showing strength

Lol APPL?
take a wild guess based on your last comment
FROG gonna print soon. In too deep.
Whats your Qs position? I just bought some 50$ dec/jan calls.
Do you think QS is gonna pop again soon, or is it more of a buy-and-hold stock?
It's been artificially held at $27, net positive accumulation by MM using either side of the sell - meaning the brakes will be coming off and this thing will be going higher.
PTON or the forbidden 
PLTR
Apha
let's go where?
Ive got 280s Im holding
Yeah I got some, they are currently dying 
Genuine question, for APHA, if the vote doesn't pass this week, the stock is pretty much dead for a while no? - so why Jan?
We don't think APHA is peaking a little bit because of election hype? I can see calling for July, but not Jan.
Yes buy as much as you can dude
More stay at home orders. hold off on oil till this little bug thats killing 1% of the people goes away.
Youre telling me you sold literal hours before they make an announcement regarding S&P inclusion?
I was at a red light with my gf the other day and there was a GNC a two Fords and a Toyota and I asked her when was the last time you saw a Tesla and she said she didnt even know what a Tesla looked like and I told her Tesla is worth more than every car company at this red light and she didnt give a fuck
Yeah so wholesome
Something about cathie woods leaving the fund blah blah

Go for February / March calls brother
Yeah the hourly candles look like an incoming moon mission
I'll be the happiest if it goes for $20 lol.. BUUUTTTT PLTR taught few ppl a lesson and it is impacting GME a lot now.. Someone should post a meme on running after GME over PLTR to get your dream power hour pump
Not happening I guess..
Lets hope buddy

I know, what does this mean?
makes sense to me I'm in both haha.
Happy Cake Day!

Same here, good bet I think
QS calls. This is the way.
Two words, FOMO
My only hope
 
I bought 1/15 and 06/18 30c
And now it's rolling over for a swan dive.

Maybe next week.
Some say that the variation is still separating

Nio day coming up, its still going strong and will soon moon up with some more news
Its not over watch.. we close at 362
Tuscan Raiders ready
12/18 are fine, this will be over by friday the latest.
Hm no. Im long, got $140 Feb calls
they'll be worth nothing by that point
What's the play, few week out calls?
WHAT CALLS?

Dude no they are not..... you are probably too high.  Better shut the RH for now.
So 96% of the sub then
 
Wait
Beat your meat and go to sleep till tomorrow morning

Me too, late Dec/Mid Jan exp. just hold  
PLTR wont rocket like it did before but it will be 35 by end of year

Zoom idiot
DoBoth
What kind of business
Sir this is a tendys
No I didnt quit my full time job. I also have a real estate business making 6 figures. But I keep the full time job to fall back on
Just deposit more in the profits section
I own part of Zoom.
Last earnings if you bought $100 OTM you still made crazy money. I wonder if it can still be done for this earnings.
Lol u play zm earings and go broke
No doubt.
I thought I was the only one worried about it not mooning yet
end of month
Jan
Yeah, youve got a month and a half. People expiring soon need to make a decision though
Yes. Still lots of time
I honestly would 
yes
Yes
yes
For sharks
Ive already done it and I feel pretty good rn tbh
I sold calls up the wazoo
If you wanna make money, ride the wave
Hell yeah. Im in for 12/4 11.5c. Let's go
Bought 30 contracts on the dip Friday. Sold 10 of them for 130% profit today. Letting the other 20 ride. All 1/15/21 expire and majority are ITM now

It hasnt been up that high since earnings, has it? But I hope you are right
console release year 

Cyclical stonks
Lockdown.
You just dropped 20k on them...bruh
Bitched out of Apple, the swings in short term options on cent changes fucking scared me and I realize why I stopped doing ultra large caps
Thats a bit too much.
Should have bought some ramen with that. 

Its going to be pinned at $20 till April.
Nice you should make some money
Just be patient shit is garunteed to moon
IV increase
iv increasing because of the s&p announcement
Volatility
IV go up and you may have good a good bid ask (12% seems a bit high but possible I guess)
IV leading into tonight's announcement
Im literally up 1.25 lol
$11k in calls locked and loaded daddy
Because Diamond Hands arent given
It's only 200$ calm down, it could have been much worse
If nothing comes up during earnings then I'm pretty much selling my shares.
my buddy is balls deep (life savings deep) in apha and he's holding

&#x200B;

edit: he's also a lawyer and a partner at a tech start up so he's fine if it goes south. felt i should mention that in the interest of honesty
It'll probably be $30-$40 but we haven't hyped it up enough yet so it'll likely hit $60+ pre merger the consolidate
Why does it do us like this 
I recently added some OTM puts a few weeks out to hedge. Recommend.
*rifle salute*
Yeah this is the bond in my portfolio... it will return a 2x might take a few months
A tease of whats to come AH when it goes to 30
No. Just try to sell before they are removed from the market
So?
My wife tells me I am.
The real play was selling GME 20c at $19
they saw me buy calls...
BABA was a sick joke made by nazis to fuck over anyone who buys calls or puts
Not this time
I joined you, lets ride
We ride to Valhalla brother
BOLD NESS
Moderna begs to differ
My puts cannot fucking wait
Yes please
I was until about 5 min ago when TSLA started dahmping
Im green on AMD
V v Green
Yes
EV bro, Batteries and shit.. Automatic driving etc
Meme Str, and it has a retarded cult following. Combine those 2 and you got Fusion.
Investors are projecting 100 years in the future. 

BTW, fundamentals don't matter in this market, hasn't for a while now.
Hype, charismatic leader, actual cars on the road for a few years now, forward looking growth since they're new and sell direct to customers vs dealerships that take cuts like traditional car manus. FOMO cycle as every time something comes up, stock goes up, and more FOMOers pile on
You cannot justify it. Its complete FOMO, hype, castle-building, whatever name you want to give it. 

Just look at what happened to NKLA. Company had no revenue and was pumped to the heavens because of hype. Musk should honestly unload a disgusting amount of his TSLA shares if hed like to maintain his position in the top 50 wealthiest people in the world for much longer
Absolutely
news is way overblown imo
Headed back to boomertown
$120 is cursed for 
Goes up $1000 AH
I seriously doubt this will be the case, and Im guessing thats why its dumping right before close. Hope Im wrong
SPY ATH tomorrow
A sell off of everything else to make room
It goes up pre market
Going down 21 smeckles. :/
If you bought tesla at this retarded fake made up number then you shouldnt be in the race.
Boomers
2 650 12/4s, were in this together broski
Optimistic.
Same
No shit, that was a beautiful dip
sshhiieeet lol
Same
Tuscan Grogu raiders mount up
Low volume trading
IV doesnt affect my equity boooiiiiiiiiii
It was a pretty nasty iv crush but i just kept doubling down cuz fuck it
Rotating out of calls and into shares/selling covered calls. I think this the play here on out.

I really wont be too upset if my shares get called away at $55 in February lol
Have Calls till Mid March and recovered some but still down 16%
You get till 415 on spy calls.
Is this really a thing
16.96% down
Lost 12%
-25% for me , weeklies can be so much fun!
14% ;(
Up 8.8% somehow. Today was a goddamn rollercoaster.
6% for me suddenly doesnt feel so bad.
Would be very interesting to see the revenue stream from corporate accounts. The last three companies Ive worked at has either given us a seamless or a grubhub account for our lunches/dinners. Obviously with WFH thats stopped
Youre a paranoid mofo
Why is zoom kill
I somehow got a GTC sell order filled today for 488 premarket.  
I dont even know how it happened, it says todays high was only 486.83
Ive been saying this all fucking day and today being what it was showed me bulls are going to enjoy December. Everything will gap up and moon starting tommorow
I picked up 2 of those right before close. Hoping that was the right call
u will be rewarded tslanian
I decided to buy stock for once and that 5 second dump just wiped away all of my gains from holding it for a month lol
RIP
Me2
Santi clause got run over by a model s

Theyll understand
Bought 1 590$ weekly call about 1 minute before the selloff. Rip.
Big uppies or big downies
Yeah I was thinking this too. Hit -10% for like 10 seconds then elevator up.
I bought calls because of this
just checked the price, the way people are freaking out and shitting on it i srsly was anxious thinking it dropped to like 23$
I like the way you retards think
Even better, if everyone buys calls the market makers have to buy the shares as insurance which drives the price up
Upvoted but also shut up new guy
Gave me a chance to sell my calls ahaha
Not everybody
Tbh, Im only down a net of $2
My 12/4 calls. :(
Its certainly not guaranteed that stocks will recover, talking from experience 

Some tickers just lose their hype and thats it, but its difficult to tell till after its happened
Fr lmao retards act like its the end of their stock goes red for a day or two.
we ready for liftoff 
thiccc  gonna take us to the promise land
i guess your memory only goes back 1.5 hour?
I use it purely for the nicer UI design over gmaps. They recently added speed limit, traffic light, and speed cameras, but still missing offline maps :(
Your wife when she goes to her boyfriends house since you dont use Apple Maps
I do.
Its so much better on iPhone than Google maps.
For real
For general driving around to frequent places (like Wendys) and ETAs, works just fine. If I am going to someplace more specific or even more remote, Google. 

I am from Puerto Rico so some places have shitty roads and I dont trust Apple Maps enough for that yet.

You were doing it for free beforehand, we just taught you how to turn it into a side hustle.

They've been 'brewing something big' since March :D
Even though youre an idiot for going all in unless its not that much money youre lucky because those are actually going to print and I can tell you with 100% confidence
why
I straight up am having a good time
It's a lot better than advertised.
Lmao...love me a good pee soaked carpet
Carpet in bathroom?  You belong here :)
Im still short NKLA
Energy, but not worth it when I can be balls deep in APHA MRNA ENPH and others
get your penny stock market astrology out of here
Hey brit imma need you to chill 
It is a casino with winning chances quadrupled, unless you are paper hands
I'm holding these 25c til it hits 30
God, that is beautiful
And that has passed? So gtfo
At like 3:30 they were $19.90
Its....$17.40.
$30c weeklies I bought at close on Friday. Praying
Dec 4 29c
15P exp this Friday. Probs will sell half today and hold the rest to see where this goes
Lol shares rn. Options really expensive on PLTR my guy
Tendies are tendies.
Look again
Low volume
Lol you can't be serious, this is a joke right?
Should do it, tesla is due for a correction anyway
dont you dare, Daddy Elon will reward you diamond hands!
At the top
Same
thats it? only up 20%. I want more!
Barely even started. 10 min pump or dump.
You think so?
LOVE IS NOT ONLY FOR THE BLIND!!
Im trying lol

Fuckin hope so
That's the power of meme stocks, they don't follow the market on days like this due to the sheer power of their autism
Wym?
Yeah, we will break through eventually, just have to let the paper hands fall. Not a meme stock if it has solid numbers and projected revenue growth.
Earnings run up
Short squeeze and cyclical console sales. Ain't nobody smart holding past Christmas.
Not big dick apple
End of month profit taking. Buy buy buy buy
Look at the chart(any nixed chart, really doesnt matter) and ask yourself: is all this justified by any real value that people want to keep in the market? No because you can make a quick buck. The dominos will start to fall
thats me im broke boi
Same I'm down 80 percent
Its a long term play. 10% down in a day is some rough turbulence but it will be back up... unless you have callls then rip
Same
Who's laughing now
I've definitely learned my lesson haha
Oh the "I sold at the top and was exactly right" guy comes out
GME has no top good sir
Yes sir 
Wow that's gonna print hard
Bought at 28 last friday dip and still holding because I am a greedy retard
Jesus how did you snag that
Try sitting through that as a contract worker on a fixed price project 
Ha
F
Paper hands 
Lmao this guy
warren buffet iq investing
I've been saying this for years... why do bulls and bears gotta fight each other? If we work together, we are unstoppable!
Literally this. Its like the people here dont understand that if we all hold the rocket goes up.
Is that not what we've been doing with Tesla?
Who are we buying from?
OK but then how do we realize gains
too many chickens
yeah if anything we should all be buying the "amazon of russia" OZON !!! This will end well.
People won't let their portfolio fail.

Great in theory, but at the same time, when people start thinking the top is near, people will sell. And problem with WSB is that people get spooked at a 30 minute red period, so the top will be when too many people paper hands that bitch.
This sub in a nutshell lol
december 3 is the scheduled day for liftoff 
Hold through the merger in the next couple weeks
wait until merger announcement
I replied in a previous comment. Unfortunately after numerous disappointments I decided to part ways with Tuscan just before/at the start of the drop.
I bought 200 and I am also confused lol
Dogshit
Hell yeah brotherrrrr
i yoloed a few calls in case
Yeah nothing but up
Noting is the new PLTR.
Jupiter thots 
surfing is awesome, hang 10 or hang yourself
I've been holding since last week. up 100%
Every post I saw explained that GME is long, yet so many people are losing their minds that its only up 10% rn. Its unreal lol
Unfortunately finally got in near top today, may average down on any major dip, but planning to hold.
Vaccine news has been repeated 10X every week and finally ran out of steam lol Don't worry tomorrow J 'Printer' Powell will talk and make stocks moon again
I dunno either. Maybe markets are spooked over the assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist?
GAMERS RISE UP
You got the like with waifu body pillow
You had the whole of wsb screaming to buy the dip.. you only have yourself to blame
TBH there was no way of knowing it was gonna bounce back the way it did.
I sold all my shares this morning avg 28.50 for some profit then got right back in at 25.50 avg
I still have Advanced Money Destroyer ptsd
What stocks I like covereds too
What CC are you selling on?
What CC?
Ive been selling calls on these big PLTR spikes. Been making like 60% returns and funding more buys intraday over the last week. My luck may run out but then Ill just sell puts
this is me
Wisdom right here
This is my entire portfolio except like 5% EV
You have a better chance of seeing Jesus.
Whats crsr
Most people here take losses
not nearly as many as get to write off $3k every year for life
Nope, nobody realizes their gains here, we diamond hand them until our calls expire worthless.
going to be a slow bleed up 3-4 days in a row.
Still has some gas. Im not sure shorts can do this every day.
I think GME held up pretty well today, looking for larger gains as the week goes on
Think you could, I'll go for a mix of longer calls and shares though
Now bulls will be fucked big time
isnt that old news
In Buyden we trust.
Theres a dude up over 2million in gme on here bro
What did you expect? Im riding the weed gang, and made more than I ever have
What those be?
>high yield growth stocks still in the market 

AVGO and who else?
When you make accusations like that, you got to back it up, or wait you are a retard
Man you really attract abusive relationships.
yep, thank you
That $18 area is so ready
yep
Theres literally no way to tell. If people knew that answer wed all be billionaires. 

The stock is still undervalued and thats all that matters for long term holding.
No way. Today a floor was established at 26. 30 PM tomorrow!
Being that I can see into the future maybe
But It is so fucking annoying that volume seems to mean nothing. 25 Mil and we are acting so similar to other days with like 9 Mil wtf
You buy at the top or what
Buy high sell low
Dont sweat it, youll be up bigly by EOW at least (tomorrow Probably)
I have NFI
Got Jan calls last week that have been slowly gaining, today is a good day. Im thinking theres little downside over the next month to Apple.
Its been stuck in the range of $110-119 for a while. Ripe for a nice run up to test ATH
Streaming service getting a boost, the new chip in the macs, iPhones, iTunes reconstructing streaming payouts for artist, Christmas time.. I mean .. it was already too low lol
I dont fuck with apple but youre honestly not wrong
I want to believe, Ive just been sooo soo dearly hurt before

But yeah, this is totally reasonable
GUH
i thought 4x margin was for daytrading power only
no I'm very retarded
im not kinda, im full blown retarded
The same bears didn't realize VIX is still tanking like Titanic.
Bears are fuk
When is the squeeze happening
Down at EOD, up AH, then some weird thing, then open green, small dip, then new ATH
You don't deserve to make it tomorrow.
PDA?
Is it confirmed to be Thursday?
Yes
I'm already up bigly from buying at 10.50, if the DD comes trough it will reach 20 or so...pre-cumming so hard right now
I would straight pee my pants
Pahmp et
Holy shit I heard the same OMG
Lets fuckin go GME 
It's a fucking bot, it filters out the pure dogshit and then it's up to you to do the rest.
lmaoooo. 4 months is all it takes to level up from retard to pinned autist
Ya probably Alex Jones 
Who cares? The stonks that are pinned almost always go up in the short term. Get in, get rich, set some $$$ aside for taxes and get out.
Lots of pumping and dumping going on now
Are you mot entertained?
Doing the lords work
Honestly. 300% in 3 months and people freak out when its sold off.  Weeklies get clapped
Yeah I bought a bunch of their shit today for Black Friday I dont know why the price is falling
Because you wanted to make money by taking risk.
no, we are smart
Im scared
Honestly this is funny asf
HAHAHAHA
Ah yes. Brick and mortar game store in the age of downloadable content or the algorithmic warfare company in the age of algorithmic warfare.
Which would you hold for long !
>2 hours into market day 


>1% drop

>thats it boys thats a wrap
Volume doesn't come close to covering the outstanding shares. You realize this right?
these kids got paper hands
$30 by EOD will make all the salty bear bitches run back to their caves.
Swapped to LEAPs last week and have been buying and selling the dips on the side is all.
Who isnt 
Youre dumb asf if you dont think Apple will be greater than 2T
mac computers are going down the tubes. Their only money maker will be phones and ipads unless they tap a new product
They cant even break through $120.
100 by EOY scrub
who wants to wait 4-5 years for a measly 300-400% return on a little part of their portfolio (maybe some dude promised on an autist forum)? Especially if I can make 10% monthly, swing trading and holding nothing.
What rumor?
whats the rumor ?
Shocking
then wtf is it

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/pWA3x794/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pWA3x794/)
Sheeeeeez hits different haha
FINALLY GOING ZOOOM
Pathetic 
Yea sell out of a massive tech company for a dead brick and mortar. Makes sense
Retard
PTLR I MADE BANK ON. GME IS NEXT. TENDINGS ROLLING IN I BOUGHT FRIDAY
same smh
Alright boys hes in, take it back down to $4.
it has to get to 22
Gotta catch 'em all

Poketards
How did you compile this?
Are you a bot?
That would be amazing. Imagine being the ceo of the company that powers half of all of the internet and youre beaten out by a guy who makes meme tweets about weed
That won't happen, but I do believe Muskrat will be the world's first trillionaire
Rather he be rich than boring ass bezos
yeah me too. just happy to ride the waves but in truth I sell nothing lol.
meme power will return tomorrow
exactly. sell long term puts. buy them back in a month when volatility dies
IV makes the spreads extra cheap.

Give up liquidity, make a bet that its above a more realistic strike; Like 12.5-15 spreads are still stupid cheap and easy 2x baggers on a 6-12 month time frame. Lock some capital up you dont need, its free real estate homie.

No way PLTR melts down to 15; if it does, buy shares and hold. Move onto the next meme while your spreads bake.
Its (SoCal especially) actually a shit ton of fun in normal times.  Live there with those housing prices not so much.
Why?
Yes, I want out
+15%
-1%
[deleted]
This company is basically a private sector DHS with a new government contract every day and Left thinks its a penny stock. Fucking pathetic.
Good technology, bad business model. Palantir needs to use their software on their own company and identify why they haven't been profitable yet. Work on their own problems instead of trying to solve others.
Put a price on your data and then multiply that by the number of people in the worlds most powerful countries and their governments, youll scratch the surface of what its worth.
RIP
Id kum
lmao i wish
Should I sell at $5 and then buy back in the dip? Is that what people do?
how stupid do you have to be to put people in nursing homes and then write a book about how great you handled it 
For real
Ban political
that guy sucks dicks and so does his gae brother
Theres 8000 volume right now just wait till 7
Was really low volume, fingers crossed we see it spike back up later
PM open priced mean very little. Volume is super low, orders haven't been put in yet.
Don't worry, CRSR is gonna rise again
Its a doozy
A gogurt because Im a child.
Coffee and fomo
Thanksgiving leftovers. At this pace I still have a week worth of priovision lol
Haven't had breakfast too busy jacking off
Tendies
Coffee and waiting in line for a covid test.
This is the gayest breakfast Ive ever seen.
Ate pussy for breakfast
morning sex, havent gotten out of bed yet
What brand tea?
dumping my jan calls at open n cutting my losses
The volume spike is great to see.
What entry price do u think it will dip to?
Up 16% on it already

I think cause it got mentioned way to much - it hit some sort cap on how many times something can be mentioned.
Whos quiet about gme its literally 20% of the posts
Quiet as a Frontier flight to Orlando on the children fly free day maybe
The bags are all of the worthless contracts.
My banned weed stock has shotnup 60% in 2 days. 

Cucks gonna cuck
WHICH BANNED TICKER BROTHER.  ?
there are so many fuckin banned tickers
Which one?
What's the banned ticker?
Which one
Free money
Government regulations
That'd be great but PDT is a Federal Govt thing not just a Robinhood thing. I'm sure RH would love to let you place more trades
If Palantir hits 50 EOW I will buy you the camo cap
All my homies love dystopian machine-learning-enabled surveillance technology
Thx retard
ez
lol, I ran with PLTR from $19 to $28. Enough gains for me.
Literally does this all the time. Well see new ATH in about 30 mins. l
Shut up lmfao I cant w people like this

Heck yeah
Probably me

about to go negative for the day... WSB about to jump ship and tank it even more
Saluting and sinking
Im back here right now bro there is no clientele 
when the dip keeps dipping
Just buy more
How long. Got January and February and these paper hands are shaking
12/31 here wat do
Was up 15 now down 25
First time watching opening bell after a holiday?
Someone should be arrested (idk who)
Theres better dips to buy
what today isnt dead bitch

besides my sweet sweet amd and aapl boomer stocks
Everything is dead
Were still under mango
14 probably
just refuelling
PLTR is lower than the Earth... hell maybe?
And then back to the moon by eoy next year
If it makes this sub shut up, I'm all about it.
looked away, ignorance is bliss...
Sold at $26 for slight profit, waiting for the dip to bottom out
Hi!  Feeling kind of meh.  Might be the weather.  Might be the losses.   Still up from the gains I took last week but thanks for asking.
Goin great everything green but dont check ur phone to see if Im right
until expiration? sounds like a great idea
BTFFDDDDDD
God I hope youre tight
Edit: typo
weed
Still here
Next time I go positive I think I sell some off. Probably half

100%
THE SQUEEZE!
people thought the squeeze was gonna happen today and got salty.
this is the way, retarded and overleveraged = green
$35 eow
Maybe in a year or two
The people in NKLA subreddit
[deleted]
lol found the retard buying puts at the bottom
[deleted]
I did, was not easy but it was fun.

Scalped it back and still rolling with a smaller scalp.

Have not touch the LEAPs, they are all free rolls.
PLTR at 42 eow?
#rekt
Lol theyll all be out by EOW anyway
Bro what dip
get out of it and get into GME son
lmaooooo
Wait is that whats gonna happen or you just memeing
or will make $100 instead losing everything.
I dont get how people dont see the potential of this company down the road. Idk, maybe not autist enough.
Youre supposed to snort them not draw them
if i see 135, i might just quit my job
Sounds like you were drawing a penis...
So tired of AAPL being a pile of shit I have held on awaiting its redemption 
Thank Timmothy Apple
Why? so we can catch a falling knife?
Have shares but why is everyone now on Apple?
They have the same chart pattern but APHA doesn't have the 1-115 spike. Both seem fine for the hype run up. They've both retreated similarly since then.

Not all price action needs to reflect on the company.
Hold youll print soon
/s?
Bruh that's literally nothing. Hold man
same brother, dont know if i should sell it or not
Im guessing you didnt buy puts at the top like I did. Because that shit printed today. Already sold lol.
Biggest company in the world but sure a meme.
$AAPL is the OG meme stock.
Lol I got in on that drop today at 555
ill bite, what news
i got in at $460 2 weeks ago
Puts
I just bought one on top of my other two. I want to ride or die with yall
Sold my 33c. If it hits then oh well. I knew I shouldnt have played with FDs Ive got paper hands
MONTHS
Maybe but it still overvalued and it's meme energy is lower than tesla
AAPL +$4: ripe for a run

AAPL +$1: boomer stonk
Perpetual 110 to 120 to 110 to 120
Not a chance. I'm still bitter bout the last time  raked me over the coals and took all my monies. Still was dumb enough to hop back in with 3 calls
Whats the news?
Retard
Actually?
Retardz.
The shortened form is always available
Did you get banned for it?
Your accountant is going to vomit.
Bought that dip on Friday 
agreed
Why you think that? 

I mean youre definitely wrong, but I wanna know why
Only if shit moons like +100% this month
Very gay, not cool.
the bears say every day of every month since march.
Zoom is tanking
You shouldve read my comments
Same!
Smart man
Do you think itll gap up AH?
Dont do something stupid
Both.

take ur gamble
Por que no los dos?
I think its just paper hands. Its not a straight drop so its not big money moving it. Just a lot of people not wanting to hold.
We are the smart people  
We are blessed lol
Riot?
Where did you see there will be an announcment
Same
I picked up a vert call for a pump, heard about the AH news coming up and grabbed a set of OTM puts as a lotto play

Thoughts and prayers
Hot potato of the week...

Smart move
Diamond Hand PLTR
> now  
>  
>Just got two coworkers to buy PLTR. 5k each. This dip is the time to buy!!  To the fucking moon!!!!! 

lol they are about to hate u
how awkward is it going to be when you have to explain how 5k disappears out of thin air
how is this a dip when today is green?

I thought everyone bought this like a year ago
Dude... I hope you're just shilling for a slightly better exit.
Theres been like an hour of trading mate it could literally end up closing at evens today and your dead cat bounce would look like a flat line if you just zoomed out a little
so ur saying it will go down more?
Being retarded is one thing but you're literally making shit up.
Then sell ya paper handed biotch
Will it pass?
counterpoint market looks very bullish at the moment
Market looks dead, not bearish not bullish just dead

End of decade?
Asshole its tanking
13k shares and 10k warrants baybee lets 
up everyday the last week. merger announcement soon. new highs today...my warrants looking good.
Literally the stock dragging down all my mooning meme stocks :(
Indeed, seems to have bigger potential thas some of the other hot shit flying around.
Welcome to my past 3 months... but going up
Shoulda spent 5 bucks on gold membership and got instant deposit ... nerd
Same with all brokers. Instant deposit on Robinhood is fire though
Lol get insta depop
Who cares; just buy calls
Fucking SIR_JACKS_A_LOT /s
PLTR to 40 easy
January gme $30 calls
Should I buy?
Dangerous play. I got puts when news dropped about, you know, not having a product and look where we are now
why? they raised their guidance today they should moon
Nope, It will readjust when market opens. Better of with shares for the squeeze anyway.
DKNG was all over the fight on Saturday. A lot of good PR.
Why bruv
Im happy this stock is rarely talked about on these boards.

Less chance for WSB weaponized autism to ruin the gains.
FOMO
I bought 10x 12/4 10c right before close on Friday. A little ambitious but fuck it.
That ticker is just pumping like crazy
Lol
The ticker is literally weed.

Lollll
It's not over $1bn in market cap.. yet

dip or correction?
You going to sell before the dividend (usually around Christmas)?
One year from now you will be more than happy you got in now
If you want to make a little money, you can still get in. If you want to make a lot of money, look for something else.
Yes
The dump before the GM breakup news

yeah, i'm not touching NKLA, slimey trevor will be dumping this week
Why not
That's absolutely brutal, wtf
Fundamentals bro - thats all it is.. Price based on sales, revenue etc nothing to do with market manipulation.
The computers who buy and then sell it real fast without deluding themselves into thinking it will moon further
Ex CEO dumping probably lol
Idk could see 200+tbh depending how these next couple months go
Covered calls are just about the worst idea for this stock. The retard strength + short squeeze could give you many headaches in the future
Yeah I'm pretty stoked on this. I also know well enough that you have to time it right or it's gone in a blink.

Just for kicks I loaded up on 12/18 expires for 15/18/20 strikes before noon on Friday. I may take my profits and go if there's a pump that extends beyond this PM activity.
Look at implied volatility
Are there shares to borrow?
Some stocks are just hard to borrow to the point it's not shortable. Lemme check on Charles Schwab
500
Not if you just check the price
Priced in
"General Motors and Nikola on Monday announced a reworked, smaller agreement that keeps the fuel-cell partnership intact but eliminates an equity stake in the startup for the Detroit automaker as well as plans for building Nikolas electric pickup truck."

And it's a non-binding agreement... basically GM wants nothing to do with NKLA
APHA
Apha easy
Im in APHA, look at the 5yr chart for ACB they dilute their shares for extra cash. No reason they wont do it again.
HEXO
Worse shorted it. Lmfao ironic *Palpatine voice*
IV too high for a good price
dates and price?
post gains pls
It was at 38 in premarket wtf is going on
It's 5 bucks. Don't be a cheapskate.
Only if you want the instant deposit ($5,000). Other than that it doesnt really do anything. The market research they give is not worth it either
Yes
The data is useful, if you cant earn five dollars with the data you probably shouldnt be trading

Morningstar is full of gay bears though

Fuck them
No.
Yea it is going to fomo up like crazy at open.
me too, but now at -14% from -8% in the last minute

going to open at -25% at least
Yes, multiple have posted they got rejected at interviews on past daily threads
You'd probably have to agree to a blood draw as a condition of employment so Thiel can see if your blood is high enough quality for him to inject.
You have to qualify for a top secret security clearance through the DOD to get on some of their projects. Theyre hiring post college grads at a 6k salary for data science/analysts, and reviews from people on the subreddit are that its an amazing company that they really believe in.
Palantir hires the best of the best when it comes to devs.  Other companies like google and Netflix are always looking to hire people who have worked at Palantir.
GM decided not to acquire
Its a company whose only profit was installing a solar panel on the former CEOs house?
GM dont want no equity deal, Badger basically ded, Milton selling his shares this week
GM put out a memo that said we still cool
[MOU not acquisition](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nikola-signs-mou-with-general-motors-301181397.html)
Where were you when NKLA is fuk
Neeekkkkkoooollllaaaaaa
NKLA
What was the news?
What, you think they are pressing the "stock go down" button? How do you think this works?
In
including me
If you believe in TA its coiling just like TSLA the last 2 months and getting ready to breakout.
17.38
Are you looking at premarket volume on those sell walls?
Just wait til the gamma covering happens

Exp? If your playing baba you need to go very long
Date?
I just bought in last week.  This is my third time buying in. It just seem to never stop climbing.
Never.. just go a month out
Get in GME, 90 is coming
I thought it was at 500. Now I look like a dumb ass hole idiot.
I'm getting into some TSLA stock today, really seems like a safe bet. Idk why I haven't gotten into it sooner but I've come to realize that any day that I didn't buy Tesla is a day I wish I had bought Tesla
Were fucked time to issue more stock to dilute existing shareholders. Lol
Robinhood screwing up is exactly how Robinhood works.
Yes they are confused because of shortened market Friday.
PM doesnt start till 9 for rh
God I'm so glad I switched to Tastyworks from RH and I wish I did it way sooner
I think its showing it as if markets closed at 1 on Friday. Like thats why half of the chart is cut off

I'm a bear but like 80% of my portfolio is in GME so I don't give a fuck about what happens in the market anymore tbh
kil
Can only lose so much money before your amount goes to zero
New share offering
Sept crash was worse than March imo
Nah itll hit ATH before then
A good way to fomo on any earnings runup is buy puts.
FedEx earnings wont include december peak season financials. If you really wanna make money off of Christmas, hold FDX until UPS reports december earnings in January
I sold at $15
FOMO
earnings 12/2
GME
Inverse RTLP, make tendies

Bought in Friday, once the house passes the Bill it will peak, senate wont pass
I remember contemplating buying it at 87 and decided not to
careful , never go full retard
What were you thinking
Me, probably
No debate
Not until they are in the money.
Gonna be mooning all week
Why tho
Why
Got the ipo lets see what she does
Dont buy leaps on leveraged ETFs is my opinion. Just buy leaps on KGC or GLD.
that's the thought... unless they try one more pump with some fake news, but see no reason this should even be a listed company
Get on puts now.
What is who cares?

BABA is a joke.
It's never too late for nkla puts
Lockup ends today and 160 million shares are free to be sold tomorrow of which Trevor owns 85 million. Today is the selloff part one, next week NKLA will be <15 dollars
Is it at $0? If not, then no
Awwwww youre cute
*sigh*
Sorry about that.  I have some ocean front property in Arizona if you're interested though
If it can't go up on cyber Monday and a vaccine approval then it's dead to me
Wholesome af
Smaller deal tho
Why does NKLA even have a $10 billion market cap?
Because all the deal is if nkla ever actually make something gm will sell them the parts.
along with a massive offering
By not accepting the 2 billions stock deal, gm basically said - we have no faith in nkla but we are just helping our buddy the ceo of nkla so he can get out.
Smaller deal and a share offering
I cant believe this thing is an ETF.
Lmao
Did a put get exercised?
Your puts expired last Friday, how tf are people this retarded not even knowing when their options expire and still buying. 

Love this sub
Lol this guy fucks
Is this in play?
You think so? I could just mean extended runup
Trolls
People overreacting
people here have the emotional stability of a bi-polar ex-girlfriend.
That's why I sold them puts haha
Dumb
But those of us who bought shares will always win
I'm so nervous, I'm wearing diapers.
Yup if theres no good lore behind a play then theres no point in playing..

The lore for psth is excellent
liquidating stocks and im in bud, roughly 2500 worth by closing today
I have 600c exp Friday that I picked up last week just before close =D
I bought 200 shares at $453 and I'm just riding that and selling covered calls against it. Seems crazy to buy in now, but there's so much FOMO, who's to say... might work out.
APHA

TLRY robbed me like four years ago of $1700 so APHA
APHA all day

Im holding TLRY calls right now
I wouldn't. I'd go with $MJ or some other tracking fund. If one moons, they all will.
Same
Nope, short squeeze won't happen until after we see what Cohen does after ER on Dec 8. This is just ER run up hype
Rip
I hope so, but youre dreaming
tendies fresh hot in the oven
Lol it won't be talked about until you see another rally
Died after JP morgan
Long term still solid. But at around $50 it's probably trading where it should.
doubtful they report monthly delivery figures this week

Apha heading to ath soon
Pumped too hard and too fast, ran out of steam and is correcting. Makes sense, its a great stock, but there literally wasn't a red day on it for 2 weeks.
Wells Fargo loaded the boat with GME shares as well
You overestimate this sub, there is 4 million volume on GME 7 minutes after open
Did you not hear about the whole online thing?
to be fair GME is profitable again and trying (and somewhat succeeding) to pivot to ECommerce, there certainly could be just a little interest from Institutions.
CCP hates ur optionz
Just sold all my BABA positions. Sick of it
Drilling to China.
Lets gooooo 
sigh...third day in a row...
:)
at about $420.69 i'll think about selling
I was wondering the same thing
Soon baby
Been holding since September !! Almost sold last week glad I didnt
y u do dis
It actually is in though. Nasdaq going red too. The only thing that might hold today is WORK where at least there's a pending buyout.
Yea whats up
Will be a green week for sure, just a bit of a panic sell because of house decisions that dont effect nio at all
lmao the selloff
they really do. 1/8 $7 has me feeling cozy.
How do you find out about these??
I finally save enough to buy exactly 1 share a few months ago and it hasn't budged except downward.
:( biggest anime betrayal 2020 = cursor
I should have sold my calls last week when it peaked.
WORK calls are easy money
Yeah since February... 
Will get bought back, again.
Begins with a P and ends with a RICED IN
Stocks super undervalued. Time to sell car and put it in 2023 calls.
After it shed like 10 percent Friday lol
right now I'm gonna wait for a dip or contraction. Then I'm gonna keep it, Sony has said that the new consoles are gonna be distributed during December or late month and said to look out for retailers store. 14th December IS the date where GME's gonna skyrocket for the moon.
April
GME was always a longer play, that wasn't it
doubling my portfolio
Yeah except its in December and not tomorrow
I lost 65% on my baba calls this morning. I am fuk also
I've been holding it for 4 months now, all it's been is that month 20% up, last month 20% down, this month 20% up and on and on
Not 4 me. I haven't entered any trades but my account working
Fr, I have a couple shares and all it's been, oh hey you're up 20% in the past month! Oh hey, you're down 20% this month!
Always had uncertainty in Nio from it's past moves, glad I skipped this time
wtf just do market order.
Tendies crisped
ive got no idea. always starts at a high but it is still positive on the day which is a plus
Always has a morning sell, just chill and if u wanna dump wait till right after open
the DD post said it would moon next week give her time
I dont know either its upsetting :-(. 2% up now... like wtf
not the top, could very well go up to 25$ imo
Good question. Ive lost 21% on this POS
that's what I have told myself twice this week after losing out on hundreds in profit
Not worried at all. Cute morning dip.
Just went in 1,200$
Where did you come up with the $18 stop?
hold retard
9:45 sell off
My calls are up 140%
Wish my dick was that long
Clearly you bought in to the wrong tickers

EOD
Didn't see that but they need to go full fed and hand out $15k and let things fall as they may.

Right after my $18ps expired
They updated to a better outlook.
nope hasn't even started yet
The long awaited one
it hasnt even started, when that shit goes off you will know... you aint gonna be asking "is this the short squeeze?". that bitch will moon so hard it might scare you
its the next meme pump and dump, which is in part, yes, a squeeze. but not that retarded one a lot of people are staking their lives on
This is 3nd time :(
Imagine not owning PLTR or GME
Well can i have some then?
Wait until you have a big portfolio. 

1k swings are a joke bro.
Lol same
You shouldve listened to Cramer
IM RIGHT THERE WITH YOU 

I dont even know if its worth holding. Are you selling???
Yes. Ive been burned jumping in too quick before, I usually wait till 0930 cst now
Same
Made two trades, sold at the mid price instead of my limit which was higher so I guess Im sitting out the rest of the day till they get their shit together
Why indeed 
Damn thats risky. Tesla was in the 400s like a week or two ago
For GME?
went from +30% to almost flat lol.
i cant be any more dead
PLTR bro jesus
Tesla would be a good move as we get closer to inclusion especially with it just redipping down to Friday after breaking its 600 resistance for awhile
How so? Planning to buy them back before the deal goes through? 

I got 100 shares and sold a 12/18 call, didn't know selling LEAPs would have been better?
yes
Is it a vertical line down? That happens rarely but it'll correct.. hopefully
Eyeing this baby hard to get back in
Sold Li and it kept going down.
Its got a fuel leak cause Elon didnt build it
Like my love life
Easy fix. Dont buy weeklies and buy LEAPS.
I feel you bro. Fuck this bitch
Pltr is clapping my cheeks rn 
Same, my guy. 10 contracts too
Honestly same. Im down half my gains from my $17c GME 12/4 bro
What did you buy at?
Monday happened.
ya does appear to be a good entry to play earnings
PSTH is the way easily over 30 EOW, grab some PTON too headed to 120
whats your NLS position?
Probably
feels bad but I had to dump my BABA calls for -80% because new articles released on Sunday trashed it.
Wtf sell immediately.
Time to buy.
Youre obv not in GME or APHA.  Be better.
Good thing you have months yet to expiry and are holding shares and have cash reserves.

He didnt betray us. Also he argued so hard for his research in the comments.
it fought through the early resistance and is now going to break 20 today!
Silence baboon, this cuckold clearly babbles. GME, ride the wave.

Welcome to the hotel GME. You can come any time, but you can never leave
yea same im trying to BTFD here as well
probably not nkla
Baba cant get ducked
Got on at open bro! Literally going to space lol
You think its going to?
Been selling calls on that thing against my leap for a while now....
Loaded 700s
edit: gay automod deleted my comment cause I mentioned K*** stonk.

I was in it when it was K..C..A..C.. I'm up 100% on my stonks and my Warrants.

I have 30 warrants expiry 2027 (but I can exercise as early as 2025) with a strike of $11.50

So that's $100,000 gain at if QS is trading at $45/stonk by 2025.

or another way to look at it is I'll be up $3000 for every $1 in stonk price.
Hes stupid enough to make it work
Im down on my 610 call at open. 
Thats what i was planning on 10 bagger secured
Literally just algos thinking it's oversold and people making a stupid bet on a bounce play without realizing that they just destroyed any bull arguments you can make this morning.
Pulled out at -91%
paper hands. stay out of the market if you cant handle seeing red
He's never too early early nor too late
Bro commas man

Get out now.
It blew out CRSRs kneecaps first on Wednesday and Friday :(
Me too, cant login on the mobile app
yea WTF I feel cucked 
It's down on all platforms, fucking joke of a borker...on a Monday at open. Luckily i opened my position right before it went in the shitter, but holy hell this is infuriating!
Whats your expiry, I went 20P 12/31

SUMO
I'd buy more PLTR if I had cash rn
To whoever bought at 19.70, congrats.

Just APPL
Yeah on GME and ap  xt
On GME, hell yes
UVXY calls and SPACs. Yes.
GME!!!!
Red? Are you looking at mrna and nvax?
It's only 10:30, PLTR can still get back up to $30. I didn't buy in NIO but watched during their Citron thing. Why does everyone act like every second matters instead of panning out?  Is that what an autist is on here?
its literally down 2%
Its never too late below $20
Yeah couldn't get any better
Wait until after Congress-China drama clears up
today could be the perfect day to get in :D
I got in today too. Its a good dip and the whole market is down so its not just this. Lets shoot for the moon!
Is that a Titleist ?

Just a pullback, no reason to panic unless your in weeklies
It just seems like a correction.
Me too and it's not feeling good...holy fuck i'm bleeding from all sides and i don't even know exactly HOW MUCH i'm losing!
what news caused the rally?
Everything on sale! Well, except NKLA. NKLA is kill.
Yeah, it got fucked hard today. But I'm still holding, even if it's for years to come.
Wait until EOD or Atleast next wed/thurs
Bruh, make it a spread. You clearly shouldnt be trading options

I have just made this promise to myself as well lmao
Yet you know youre 35k down?!
BTFDDDDDDDDDD

Is it?
Get a margin account
Did you do a deposit recently?
you know why... WSB idiots all holding the same shit
Meme stocks strong together
Everything is going down rn. Its not just those two, its the market.
AAL over southwest?
No shit, my expiration is this Friday. Cant hold after this week. Duh
I've been holding GME shares for 3 weeks and added to my position this morning. But also selling calls for that sweet premium crush.
I caught a sweet profit on that last week already, should have held longer tho
short squeezed your nuts lmao goteem
Nobody said it was happening today.  Every single post about GME has been buy and hold stock, or purchase april calls.  What part did you not understand?
you mean the short squeeze that everyone who's long GME has said isn't happening today? crazy that it didn't happen today
are you joking
margin call notices go out today, 24 hour countdown to tendies. Should be slow and steady, but upward trending.
always buy the dip, a bundle of sticks   
Not a lot of movement
Dead cat bounce ?   anyways, lets FOMO
My man
I bet it correlates with volatility.
I bought one at $23 and im in the red so take that as you will

Basically market manipulations

The best is when you lowball the bid, pick up some weak hands calls and already profit 500-1000
Haha same bro, it was up pennies so I just sold it off
Calls?
okay bear
When you're tired of making money
If it's shares, I think you should hold.
Get out while you can retard
Never
Hell yea brother
I have Nikola puts. Should I cash out or wait until next week? Until lockup expiration
other countries are more fked than us lol
[deleted]
Looking that way, but with a 91% institutional ownership, it makes you wonder how the price dipped so fast.
Its a correction after the massive rally it had. If it stabilizes at this price point, Ill jump in
It's real undervalued though... so i'm well confused.

Boomer as fuck....like yahoo finance pro
I sold some covered 21c 12/4 this morning for 1.25. that's insane for something that has to go up 15% in a week.

Good man shits crazy
Wtf
Its not about the money.  Its about sending a message
You need to say the magic word
Needs to hold at it's current level so my GE and F calls can recover and I can roll that cash into puts before EOD.

End of Lockup is going to destroy this shitcan company.
Thought there would be one giant sell off before the end of the year before JPow ATH+++. Perhaps that was it.  Not giant & barely a sell off.

No, that was just an anomalous blip.

Why do the mods get to decide what we talk about? THC has been fine and other SPACs are allowed ro be mentioned, what do they have against it? Or do they have positions and don't want us touching the stock?
Tesla
If anything, the lack of availability probably helped them via all the social media BS. Just artificial scarcity in full swing. Theres like...1 new game out for both of these consoles? 

Their lack of supply is making it seem like theres a lot more demand than there actually is. Which in turn might...Increase demand?

Making a public statement like were sorry there werent many consoles available would destroy the illusion of a successful / in demand product.
im diamond handing this shit
lol did you bet on a chinese company
Lol what? How is it a pnd shits got gov contracts
Wait for IV to settle a bit before (and maybe miss your entry) then do the other half after after ER if it doesnt pop

Yes, they are aware of the issue. Their web trading system works AFAIK.
What's the support at?
GME for sure
me.
It did go down.
It does and is going to drop for a couple days with the rest of the overbought market.
Stfu it was down for like 30 minutes. Its due for another rally
Probably not? Lock in your tendies man, 40% is nice.
sell most of them, probably have an upswing tomorrow because of reasons.
Powell speaking tomorrow. Maybe sell some and hold some to see what happens, set stop loss for remaining to prevent going red.
what dog you got
Ive been holding Aurora cannabis for months and Im still down
I never have an issue.
Sell.
Sell them and buy back later

Word, I tried egg nog in mine this morning.. did not disappoint
Quietly.
Buy in not to late it wants to moon
me too
Are you telling me we are crashing soon? You swing the other way of something. You can come out of the closet, we wont judge, you fuken bear.
Was hoping it would dip down to $27, but it still has strong potential if you are just gonna buy and hold shares. Technically speaking it was being supported by the 15 minute 50 period moving average (never dipped below that) on this entire run from the mid teens up to yesterday's high above $40. Today it dipped below that support, so we could see an extended period of profit taking.   


If you take a small position now that's probably fine, I'd hold off on buying calls for a few days though until it's clear that it's resuming the uptrend.
That was so last week
APHA
What a champ, I dipped at 575 and then had to work so didn't see where it went.

Edit, FUXK

Horrible mindset to have 

You will lose and lose and lose with that mindset
I bought a lot at 39, it will take a week or so to hit 50 again, just be patient. It is a red day in most of the market.

ARKK ain't boomer, if you went something like VOO yes
Those of us that got it before The public  hype knew this would happen. Institutions have been bag holding for a long time so they where selling regardless. Just need more retail to jump in and it will continue to push higher through earnings.

Hasn't moved since July. Low energy!
Yup. Boomers own gold/bonds 40%, I own MSFT 40%
Today is the perfect day to buy it tho
Not when youre the dip
Wish I would have seen it under 20. Anything under 20 is a buy. Sell cc on it to bring the cost basis even lower. Will get up to 22-25 during earnings can sell and buy back at a discount. 

This thing lingers at 20 so can wait for another dip or buy in anytime around here and be safe.
They just had the M1 launch, let them chill a bit.

I heard there will be more M1 stuff later in 2021
Upgraded to Buy, today
There's supposed to be a surprise announcement in December

Broke out of the rectangle
I figured holiday shopping season would boost AMD.  I bought some back when it was about 50 and it's paid off but frankly hasn't done much since hitting around mid 80s.  Told myself I'd sell it once it hit 90 but now I'm thinking it'll reach higher fairly soon.
As in dow chemical? Jesus, mate, thats good luck
Don't worry it'll sell off soon

Yeah, I saw that too. I assumed it was a glitch (it went up to +.66% on the day), but I see the daily high is 3228.39. Was that an actual sale?

Google Implied Volatility.  IV crush is real.
IV (volatility)

Implied volatility - the options market already priced the underlying stock improving into the price of the options. It needs to exceed expectations above and beyond what was already baked into the price

I fomo'd in some more at 27+ near open, feelsbad now but im sure it'll be a rounding error in the long term
Yeah honestly probably not bad in the long run though

I added more today as well

But moving forward always buy spacs midday they always dip
Honestly would take the gamble. If you believe it's stripe, the difference between buying at 24 or 26 won't matter.
300k can make you a decent living from home
Imagine not buying 0% down

I dont understand why they are opening IPO at such a high price. If you look at Uber, its less than what DoorDash is going to IPO at.

No thanks, ill pass on it.
Uvxy is so shit I lost so much money on it I would say stay away, so many other opportunities
No. Bad idea. You will get wrecked doing that
Not a bad hedge for long portfolios but definitely is not a play in itself
I occasionally buy a few hundred dollars worth at EOD if I'm feeling paranoid but never more than a day or two
until they bring their delivery times down, institutions will be on the side waiting to buy in
Volume too low for my taste. Looks neat like MJ tho
You mean most boring way to play weed stocks?? Ok boomer

I think this is to decide if they add the shares over 1 day or 2.
Figure it's just a formality?
I believe just details of how it will be included, involving which ones are being dropped.

Pretty sure its inclusion is confirmed though
It's  a decision on how/when not if. Some people are asking for them to do it in stages to help volatility.
Thanks, it's indeed about how they will do it.

Ronald Reagan had it right - abolish capital gains tax. No such luck yet.
Can you link whatever made you post this
Might need to go to the low 300s with Friday expiry with that. But I do think they'll tank hard enough to make you green tomorrow morning for a fleeting moment.
Idk what that will get you with the premium as high as it is.
5-10% is fair
100%
im happy with .5% , everyday? doubtful
You need to be making like 2-3% everyday to cover mega losses on bad days.
On long term account:30-40% yearly.
On yolo RH acct: prob 80% per play (I'm not trading everyday if the setup isn't good)
I dont have a specific goal which is probably why my all time is -95%
Depends on the amount in your portfolio. 

Large ports:  2-3% 

Small: 5-10%
If you mean what % of the original do I aim to have my portfolio at by the end of the day, usually I aim for 10% increase but I am really aggressive and Im an opportunistic investor (I buy the dips mainly)
Got some tickers I can burn money on?

RMG, APPLE (duh), MNGI, PLTR, and PTSH. Oh and AMD
PSTH
well, unless something drastically changes in the next 35-ish minutes, WSB going to be a lot of "R MY CALLS FUKED" "I LOST EVERYTHING BECAUSE OF YOU ASSHOLES" "LONG ROPE" "DIAMOND HANDZ" "GME GANG RISE UP" "WHAT HAPPEND TO THE PLTR ROCKET I WAS PROMISED"
Bought 500c 12.4 and regret it soooooo much, thought it would have earnings run up
go on...
Positions?
Wtf are you smoking?
Wtf is profits?
Profits cuz its not going any lower
Looks like market is stabilizing, Id take profits.
It shoots up after I sell for an 80% loss. I should have held. I held MSFT through 90% loss in March and ended up making monies.
Whats the news youre waiting on?
fuck that, buy 2k worth of GME shares and then sell when the price doubles in a month, THEN buy TQQQ (btw i hope ur not actually intending to hold TQQQ for decades lmao)
Technically the past for ACB is diving to the core of the earth
Well if ACB is anything like the last pump it's going to die in PM tomorrow before we can sell lol.

But the price action today is a shit ton healthier than it was during that pump. Plus the news it's pumping on is two catalysts over the next couple weeks so has some dump protection.

If it tanks tomorrow then GG but I'm going for the moon on my calls.
coulda had it under 100
No plz that will delete my account
You know every other stock is like that to right ? Lol
Bitch, AAPL still ain't recovered from Sept 2nd high of $134... which, of course, I bought at.
My point was market open today.  I hated to do it but that stock drives me crazy.
Depends on how long you have to wait and how much capital you have tied up in it.

I am about $160k in, 30k of that in feb calls so I have no choice but to wait. Currently down $16k so that sucks but what can you do, orange man and his minions love to fuck around.
Damn I wanted to get in on that more than once and pussied out. kind of surprised it didn't pan out.
bought 10.80, sold half at 16.75

chillen on the rest, fly baby
What is their CEO's name?  Go ahead.  Middle initial and all.
Intel is garbage. It's weighing down my portfolio
Intel hasn't made a penny for it's investors in like 3 years and all their products suck right now. They've dropped bigly like 3 earnings reports in a row.
fuck intel
NVDA
AAPL has been overdue for a run up.
I wont even theta that right now. Atleast PLTR is a real company with real products... and GME.
Ive got 12/11 180P, so bloated
I've made a small amount on IWM puts but it's stubborn
My balls say no.
No youre not!! Tomorrow the fun begins
fuck shoulda listened
I did.  Wish I bought more
pls dont buy tsla puts for ur own good lol
If you hold options expiring this week you could be pretty fucked.
Hold NIO idk about PLTR
Its up baby
!emojify
Go home Chimpu
To the moon brother
Get rich or homeless amirite??
Lol I was just about to do this. Best of luck to you if you decide to send it
2nd December is the merger news
APHA
APHA
ACB
Its not a one day play?
me too wtf
Its a nothing burger, the news is on whether SnP funds buy TSLA shares over one trading day or two
The percentage split for being added to the S&P 500.  All good news...people are just worried (for no reason) - hence the short term sale off.
God bless Vincent Kennedy McMahon
Somehow got a fill at 488 today
bagholding shares and 25c march
ARCT
Those premiums are juicy
Can confirm, quality worm dirt
Wednesday but they have 3 years to comply. Wont stop panic sellers
That would have paid off today. You missed out on that chance, except maybe on baba
Was so close to chucking a grand at Tesla to test the waters, phew
UPS
Buy it on GME
SUMO
**HOLD THE LINE**
his tsla calls <-- WTF --> my tsla calls
 Always    like a true degen
My LEAPS are doing extraordinarily well, always saves me on red days
method for adding to S&P
I sold all mine but I also read the BABA CEO said they would comply with any ruling they need to meet to stay on. Just sick of all the negative news and delay of ANT ipo
god damn... BABA looked like it bounced of support well.. then this shit... Can't win them all I guess. :( DIamond hands calls for 2021
:(
Moon moon
People panic selling for no reason.  Just hold.
Its moved 200% in 3 months
So institutional buyers don't cover as price increases?
Sorry man. I finally decided to dip my toe in after 3 hours of it being flat and it immediately started tanking. Fucking POS
market needs to take a nice shit once in a blue moon
I mean it's been pretty euphoric the last few weeks. Have to think it's just a correction from that
Lol less than 1% is not a cliff.
gladly
What u pricing the calls at?

Same
Better be because I picked up a number of calls last minute
Got shares
Insiders buying for stimulus pass and vaccine
Think ACB might print by end of week, really depends on how far it pumps off vote in next couple days.  20% drop wont do you much good if its from 13 to 11
GYNA is assho
You got no idea 10$ maybe even tomorrow
Yea imagine being able to afford rent
That is a cliff not a dip
I bought March zoom $300 puts lmao
I wanted to buy 1 5 minutes before close so bad but it would have needed to move like 7% down for it to be worth it and it was fucking 3k for a single contract. Too many of these earnings have resulted in like 4-5% movement either way making THETA gang the winner.
Itll get bought up probably. Idk tho Im retarded
Patience
Not watching that garbage has helped my trading so much
Yessir
I needed this optimism ty
Inverse wsb
Most people buy far OTM calls with 1 week expirations
So you are saying more room to fall
A true winner
Noob here, what ticker is that?
POS ticker
If you have weekly FD then it's not going to work but this stock is a solid long term play
ATH is in the 60s ya fuckin retard
Short it then, bunch of you guys talk shit yet have no positions ffs
We make the rules now buddy
Hertz went up 100% in a single day
worked for HTZ, KODK lol we just want tendies we're not boomer investors scrub
  bears are so dumb they dont even look at the 5y chart, nice DD
ATH?? Are you really that dense??? ATH is 60+ you autist
Lol their restructuring. Just bought back a ton of senior notes but apparently that means BK. Cohen is in for above 9% and transitioning this to an online play. But if you wanna rag on us then dont be mad when we moon.
Bought some after the citron report just so it would crash and shut them up
GME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It hasnt even popped and you want to leave?!
 ain't gonna short squeeze before earnings
Leave would be pretty dump considering the pop is coming literally ina few days
Yes boiiii 
No, that's super bullish. When everyone talks about it is when MM's shake off the paper hands.
Looks like all spacs across-the-board are up around 5% I will wait for dip
Up all the way to the moon friend. This is just the beginning. Check out the daily volume.
hey wait i know this one

Jumped on 300 shares baby
Nah
dude, it's fine. hold
Bro its up
Proof or ban
It was down on Friday what are you talking about lol
not too many tiktokers here haha
Thats why we have 
look out for this high roller
I grabbed 100 at $18.53.... right before drop. It's how I roll.
good man do your part as wsb degen autist retard group
Huge mistake. You done fucked up. Should have bought 10x that amount.
It was. gme = blockbuster

Dang!!!
Pre revenue, pre product,... what do you expect?
Nobody can keep them on the shelves lmao
console sales won't be on the earnings since its q3
This would be much more compelling if it was previous generations where they had a monopoly on this space. People arent loyal to GME for their consoles, shit Kohls was selling the things and people still ate them up. Maybe theres a case to be made for peripherals but its so early in this gen, there really arent any.
No one can tho, right?
doesnt gme make money off trade in tho?
Hmmmm
Bruh fair market value is 13$.   I cashed out at 30$ on my calls and Im not playing with fire.  So over inflated it aint worth half of what its currently trading at.
Stop being so gay
why would you do that
Coming from someone who lost 14k on spy puts in April, just buy calls. 9/10 times it works and as long as you dont buy FDs youll survive the 1/10 times it doesnt work
You dont have to stop. Just stop gambling with puts with short expiry. It is so easy.
See you next payday
Stop trading 0dte options then you dipshit and go long term or just shares it's seriously not hard
If you're bearish by nature and can't bring yourself to buy equities, I suggest that you buy TLT calls (no earlier than Feb) instead of trying to call a top. If we're going down in some sort of insolvency event, TLT should perform well.
[deleted]
Now is the time.  You don't buy on the runs, you buy on the pullbacks in between.
Who touched ur butthole this morning?
This. 

The best advice I ever got was to set a profit goal and exit when you hit your target. Dont doubt the vibe and play your strategy and youll make money money.
Have you ever made money on a meme stock?
SQUEEZE
It green home boy
Lookin spicy for sure
Either sympathy moon or speculation moon
there was an interview
i know we joke about being retarded, but you must be legit retarded if you cant figure that out on your own
Shares ya goof
we're still here. gonna wait for the rocket
I tried Etrade for like a day and closed my account and switched to ToS
Cancel it and get RH or webull
No dip today just buy
Im waiting for a dip personally. If there isnt an obvious opportunity before noon or so though, Im just gonna say fuck it and pull the trigger.
Yeah definitely
Im gonna buy some premarket , some an hour after opening
Putting?
Trippin
It up 1%?
duh
Yes. Buy buy buy
Gme or PLTR...
i have an order for open on it!
It was 20+ premarket in the morning and then dumped heavily. Buy at own risk
Still time?
Yes. Set multiple limits and wait. See how far up the board they get filled.
$40-$70 is pretty realistic imo down the line
No one really knows because the amount of shirt shares is unprecedented but 30 is definitely on the low end if it does pop off
Cause the actual price keeps dropping
Whens the expiry?
Yup. Expires this week?
Hit the mystery box and get a ray gun!
29 not nearly as bad as 33 on Friday. Maybe scale in 1/4 of the position you want to take over a couple of days?
Fuck it dude, I joined this sub yesterday, did about 2 hours of personal research on my computer and made PLTR calls, retards to the moon 
If it makes you feel better Im holding 12/18 QS 17.5p
How the fuck are you down on QS
i aint selling, it would be a great hold
Itll prolly go past it today lol.
It's GREEN today.
Every damn stock is red today and they think the problem is pltr. And then they're surprised if they lose money
No its not you autist its up 44 percent in the past 5 days Hahahah. Grow up
@27.818
Everything back to 10$

10:42 was the best time for pltr calls
Ban
buh red is mor sexy
That just means its daily price action is dependent on wsb autists.
That shit still payed next months rent so Im not mad
Are bee's the new Meme now?
Bro you had months to buy it between 10 and 15 and you waited until it popped to 19?

You will be fine just hold through earnings. You might see an initial dip but if the conference call goes as well as we know it will it will moon in the few days after.
bruh its still up 9% on the day. This things gonna run

u talking about thic bee?
Still holding brother! Whats with the comments about the vote getting delayed till April ?
Also, what other SPACs u got ?
everyone is at lunch lol
Is this true
Lot of hedge funds and portfolio manager hold GE so not surprised.
I'm not gonna lie. Im so retarded I haven't been able to figure out what  is lmao.
Once there's some actual movement, there'll be a lot of FOMO and hype. For instance, there was minimal hype about PLTR when it was cruising at $10.
Eow, its all youll hear as it soars 50% in one day
We stay silent while u guys miss the opportunity
Haha, they are announcing merger in the next week. Chill out
We cant
PSTH
PSTH 22.5c 1/15 really cheap

WSB being wrong about something? shocking
Never enough loss porn tbh

99+
Ain't selling PayPal-SkyNet. Tin-man Schwarzenegger will pull them from my dead body, literally.
Shitron almost succeeded but now they can go fk themselves
Free money, bought more at 24.70
Until 4/20
Leading up to Jan 15, hopefully good news on cannabis and federal legalization will pop the market.
never
Yes
Doesnt matter theyre over growth is going to be reaching new tops than 29 . 

https://investorplace.com/2020/11/why-bears-must-not-bet-against-pltr-stock/
This. is. the. way.   You'll be kicking yourself later if you don't hold.
if we can pull it off it's gonna be fucking nutty
that's actually insane they're still doubling down
The shorters lost $127 million today... I can only get so hard
English pls
Fantastic.  I'm hoping they stick around until Q4.
Yes we just have to believe
bro be patient lol. buy some shares and chill
No, optimistically it'll be at $15 EOW.
Heyyyy its ok its ok come on in well treat you nice.
they have an interesting PE
Its up 7% still and about to rip into the 20s calm down
HAH THEY WILL WIN THIS IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF
I bought in at the dip of 18.4 cuz it looked like it found support
Lol Spy is down half a percent lots of people should be
Haha I barely scraped by NGL. Shoutout to ITM RKT calls for clutching the reds
I mean in regards to BABA, is anyone really surprised? she just loves edging us
EV bulls didnt get fucked we got a discount today lmfao. The only people who got fucked are the ones who didnt buy the dip
BABA bulls are kinda used to it by now.
Boring
How do those two things even relate to each other, retard
Gme
ZM. It will either smash earnings and rocket to the stratosphere or miss and drill to the earth's core. The challenge is guessing which one.
Accumulation. Ask yourself why it hasn't dipped, because it's pinned at $27 and each share under that price is getting bought up by funds, retail and your local friendly spiderman.
Algos tryna kill the 12/4's?
Its just taking a nap dont worry brother
Penny scalpers
Idk but its hella annoying that certain blank check shits are out performing PLTR
Hold
Yes
At least wait 'til a few minutes before close. PLTR fixin to break up or down any second now.
no
It really is. People are silly. We rise this week and then finally when they announce tracing.. PEEEEEERM 
Nah, everyone dipped into GME and TCH B. After that GME paper hands FOMOED into APPL.
Yep
Get in
Gonna need a hell of a drop to beat out that IV
Teams is gay like you
Market sentiment today bringing it down, 600 ah
Its garbage and it got pumped up for being a meme.
Thats hardly a yolo, if its almost guaranteed to hit

No
Store credit only
It's been one day dude, earnings on the 8th, I have no idea wtf is gonna happen, but it's been one flat day
Idk bout you but I've made a fuck ton of money off gme including today on shares and calls.cant stop retards being retards buying at the top and quitting on the first dip mane.
All you need
So buy the morning dip? Got it
Not a bear but couldnt agree more
Good fucking luck
100%
Rumour confirmed. Moon mother fucker moon
Please dont

Don't like actually do it though
So if it opens at 21. Youd still do it?
You shut your whore mouth
Cant wait for the meme tomorrow with the guy checking out gme instead of pltr and pltr being jelly
Confirmed
Yes
Not at all. GME is only good for a short squeeze play. PLTR is a not dying company like GME.
Lets do it , I did my part in 355 shares
It will 
34.99
Oh big dick theta gang will gladly tell you
shouldve sold at 33
27.40
Been saying this.. paper Mario hands out here are crazy
Because I want you here, friend. Please keep your chin up. Better days are ahead.
You aren't losing if you have a job. You aren't losing if you're living. Life is an opportunity full of a series of opportunities, just keep moving forward friend.
Chill out dude. Go to the gym and get big. Play the stocks and get rich.
Buck up buddy. Youre not a loser. Youre autistic
because for there to be winners, there also have to be losers. Thank you for your sacrifice.
Join the union they said...
30 today
I think youre going to be fine. Might hit $30 today
Lol, this company was literally dead a few months ago. Its just a pump and dump. Great if you can time the market, but be ready for huge losses if you cant time.
Yes
Ofc
Please
Facts
Wait until the vaccine starts going out and it rockets
Long way before the end of the week though
Please translate what does this mean
Wtf are you trying to say?!
Last week I looked like Frodo, today I look like Gollum.
Only went up 15%+ today i know right damn, where is the 1000000% gain

Patience my son, the shorts are starting to cover... why do you think it jumped $3 at open on ridiculous volume

We will burn the shorts alive
When +10%  are disappointing its time to take a break and become less over stimulated.
Itll be a few days yet
Kinda is a bit of an understatement
12/18 calls printed. 

I sold near the high this morning and put my gains into shares.
Dude this was a long call, relax.
That you wish you would have bought more Tesla?
Another stock split. I agree
That youre gay??
they are going to offer more shares
what
Guh?
It popped
Its up 30% since Friday morning!
lol what kind of rally are u expecting u pos?
lol AAPL hasn't been relevant since the split
Get some groceries
  
SEC whistleblower hotline:301-887-7306
Looks to me like its going to remain flat as a pancake for the foreseeable future. Im all in on it and nervous
Yeah we need to rocket I am fukt so far
Doesn't matter as long as you buy lower and sell higher
https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/

Certainly feels that way
whose doing the p&d ?
Nobody denies it but why not riding the pump
Thats dedication 
Where you off to?
Yes, just may take {god forbid} a few days
Yup.  ATH by EOW.
I'm selling for a loss EOD. I don't want to get IV crushed.
Yes.
Just fuck off already
Again and again and again...
Sounds like someone missed out on some tendys
yeah its really bad, holy shit
They're all in super deep denial right now. And this is coming from a former PLTR bull.
delusional
bruh what its fading hard
Do you post these things in hopes that people are wearing a blindfold when they click buy?
Yup should have bought dip buddy
What news lol
Bro... bullish AF!!!
Hard to say but I think it could be.. Im debating whether or not to get into Nio or XPEV this week
From read that was his father's name.  named it after him.  feel for them.  That said Bears R fuk.

Peanuts
yeah it's just laggy because of the fog
Lets all buy then Bois 
AAPL?
Still below March highs but yea
Yo fuck aapl, all my homies hate aapl
Feel like Loafed to the tits was a missed opportunity
ath is 62$
Not at ATH
Buy high sell higher
Now that there is an end in sight there is no stimulus. End of story. GOP is gonna find their inner deficit  hawks that have been hibernating for 4 years.
Probably tsla again
PLTR
Gme duh
FSR
Yeah, I can afford exactly zero of those contracts
that premium will shoot up once markets open
There is nothing responsible about trading it. You either buy and hold it, or you are gambling like anything else
I remember when trading spy used to be irresponsible
SPY is basically AAPL.
Why aren't you doing that now?
you will kick yourself if you miss the squeeze cause of covered calls
Betting against retard strength is a risky game
Risky
You must be new here
Short squeeze
Do you even read bro
folks here are convinced it's going to squeeze this week
ALEXA PLAY RUMBLE BY EXCISION
GME at open
GME calls at open. Short squeeze
Let it dip then 
May want to see what happens before jumping in
30 12/4
Do 12/18 30c
It's today. That's why it dipped. Don't spread misinformation.
Based on banned ticker evasion you have no idea how many panic attacks you set with that comment.
You and I, together. Death to zoom.
I might. Trying to get weekly to play earnings, or looking longer?

Buy now

YESSSSSS SIIIRRR

Till 50
Forever
It only does shit during pre-market and after hours
Lmao!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bruh, it's all about the merger, patience.
Yo cards are basically stocks, Im doing the same right now. We can always rebuy when this hype dies down in a year or so :)
What is the short interest?
son, were in the early stages. I bought Friday at 15.86 and just doubled down at 18.30
Buy the dip. Everything is about to explode up
too busy getting cucked by CRSR instead
Just you, literally everyone else already rotated out

Truly shithole country? 150k usd is probably plenty
300/month rent, 1.50 a day for eating out, and you need a higher opinion of shithole countries and a passport worth more than dogshit.

Depends which shit hole
Best comment of the day.
You got until April 11th you good
Holding
Right? What the hell am i supposed to buy now?
IV crush, and depending on your strikes it makes total sense.

They will learn to roll out using their winnings, it takes time for the new ones to learn is all.

Bought puts!
AMEN brother, I sold my 90 average 21.18 shares at 29.09 and my 1/15 $21c that I bought for 1.40 for 10.40. So fucking glad I got out.
Next on TLC:
NKLA is worthless fugazi. Not even the kind you can make money and run from anymore, the hype machine is even gone.
GME 
Last week was a strong FOMO...
Rinse and repeat
Yea this was pretty obvious lolll
If you think Citron has anything to do with this dump I have a bridge to sell you lmao
Heck it's the only green ticker on the map. Solid hold / buy!
I can lose it all in under five minutes no sweat
This.
DIAMOND HAND GANG RISSSSSSSE
Well not only did I diamond hand my calls I fucking bought more 3 times in the last 15 minutes.

CRSR is a great company, everyone not buying now will regret it
It was going for like a month straight before last week
Did you have a nap?
Did you miss it when it was <25 just a few mins ago lol?
Strike on pltr?
Could go even higher tbh 
Agreed
Listen to it all day same song on repeat
If you sold calls shouldnt you be in good shape? Or are you saying you bought some and now you sold them
Yes
Sounds like we should El-Erian the side of caution
at least you have a source
lmao

so i guess they did their D-DD
Blowout sales on what
keep them there, dont want them overcrowding my calls
sector rotation from a big MM? idk someone said this time of the year the bond stakes increase so that couldve caused the drop i guess
GME because itll inevitably die and no one here knows what PLTR is. Its just a meme.
GME, ass company running on earnings
Pltr - as I did before shitron posted.  Pltr game is quite long, GME is Q4 earnings (much sooner).
Gme
If you are actually holding 12 months you will be bless.
UR FINE BRO
Answer this question, do you still think AvePoint is going to merge with Apex? If so, hold. If not, sell
It's up 10% and the run began 2 trading days ago ya tard
Hold the holy cock out of it, 3x-5x play
wat. it's up 10% today
what do you think?
How much did you buy for? If you just bought at around this price it might stay somewhat stagnant for a bit.
sell and buy GME
Probs not
Theyve actually made me money. Cant complain.
About what?
Long leaps on good companies. Hold and print.
Those dont exist
Tesla
Facts
Fuck it. I'm in with 975 shares. Consider it a donation to you tards.

When it pays for your tesla
I made 10% in it today. In and out in 10 minutes. My wife is very jealous
AAPL 12/18 calls.. 
Do you like APHA?
Lmao did you read like 3 comments?

>House voting is huge

Except it's DOA in the senate... imagine not knowing how Congress works and advising trades based off that ignorance
if my understanding is correct, i think its short share holders selling calls against those short shares.and the answer is that they are already so deep in this position they might as well go for broke
Ur so retarded you think MMs are the one who sell calls
Shut the fuk up.
rumor is they will announce a merger wednesday...wonder with whom

im guessing amazon, but that's just my bullshit guess
Fuck yes!
No kidding thank god
i'm still down 30% on my 12/18 45c :(
Still way down from a few days ago..
You know what that means... 
More than just that my friend
Im definitely a passenger on this 
MSOS
inclusion news after hours

&#x200B;

me thinks big uppies
If it ends today above 588 then PT for tomorrow is between 605 and 650. If it ends below 588 then calls are probably boned
what is supposed to happen tomorrow?

Could inclusion be rejected in any way?

Yes. Only lease German cars or they will cost you in the long run. Dont get me wrong, love bmw, but I wouldnt outright buy one.
its a 9 year old european luxury car, what do you think?
yes. make sure you have lots of tendies for repairs n shit
Seriously, it hasn't done anything since earnings.

OvErVaLuEd MaRkEt. Spy is going to be under 300 in the next 2 months
Today was a good day to take profit on monthly calls and rotate into shares + selling covered calls. Maybe also some leaps once IV comes down a bit (90%+ IV is still a tad high for OTM leaps imo)
Idk, it actually looks like it might recover tomorrow or wednesday. I'd be worried if it kept going down instead of coming back up to $27.
Nice timing
You're in good company.
Who had this kind of power?
Nice I joined at like 3:30

Lets go
What was the premium on that? I see they just crashed hard.
It will moon just to fuck us...
Who said bears were supposed to get a big selloff?
Be wary of PSTH, has a brutal history of pump and dumps
PLTR market cap is too high for revenue, but still an amazing investment long term, but this is wall street bets! Gamblers go!
Which one is more likely to go up 25% by end of week?

If you're going to buy in to the meme hype you're also interested in maximizing your dollars. If I had 10k and could only choose between GME and PLTR this week I'd put it all in GME.

I may actually be doing that and close off the rest of my TGT position which is just shy of 10k right now.
Invite them here so we can flame them
APHA GOING TO THE MOON
 
Buuuuuttt...PLTR is up PM? I no understand.
Thats wild
enough with the percentages people, we want to hear about dollar profit (loss)
Imagine putting it into gme
Yeah that is what I said Friday, probably death of meme stock. Lost it's will to live.
Idk man it worked out for a long while if you werent greedy
Yes I'm very sad I was extremely excited and was just pushed the perfect direction to lose money
We are an hour in paper hands.
username checks out
I mean...hindsight is always 20/20 but for PLTR it was so easy to see the top was in. I sold on Thurs and I think that may have been the peak? Its hard for a stock to go up when everyone and their mother who is interested in buying already did.

Edit: Wed not Thurs
Dump*
often read this about TSLA a few month ago xD

TA is dumb lol
Nice lines so stonk go up or down 
It hit +24% at one point
GM backing out of their equity stake will do that to a fraudulent company.
For me its NKLA weekly puts, PLTR long calls, GME weeks calls, NIO long calls
short NKLA, long GME & DISCA
GME
I think so. I'm all about it though.
NKLA rolling downhill now
Pretty sure its a 100 million share unlock, 90 percent being Trevor miltons, so were bouta find out if its a scam or not if he dumps his shares today
GM deal intact but they basically said "Yeah we are in business but we have a new deal, and its way smaller. Also no equity stake"

Basically GM says, fuck you NKLA and Fuck you Trevor, you dipshit
Gm no longer taking a stake
No GM deal
They are all over the place like a yo-yo, Id like to buy here but dont trust it
I love to see hyliion go down, that sub is full of fanatics and shills.
Hopefully it goes to 0. Tomorrow first day they can sell the shares or today?
They have convince most, but not all of the institutional investors to hold their shares until April. Dont count on a rapid decline just because of the lockup expiring.

That's what I thought on friday. bought 12/18 $35 calls at the top anyway. today I'm very happy I did. YMMV.
Bro its been monthsl
Its a short squeeze waiting to be triggered, and lots of DD posts confirmed that if enough autists bought in with shares that it could contribute to a short squeeze that could rival VW in its intensity. Well see what happens.

Calls on literally anything
you missed it already
Honestly... for $300..  Maybe a weed-stock call

lots of those stocks made moves last week. might be cheap enough premium/share prices to get an expiration 2 weeks out or more

I have a TLRY call that expires soon I got a few trading days ago for only $52, up 108% and I don't think its anywhere close to done printing
On what?
Pretty sure they do up to $1,000 instant deposit availability and I think up to $5k or $10k if you have RH gold.
Settled lol, you were able to buy with a unsettled deposit because they gave you margin lmfao. Why do you think you have day trade limits? Because your on a margin account not cash lol
Idk ask me last week when I bought the dip and it was the first of four. 

Its cyber Monday and its taking a crap. 

Seems like a strong buy.
i would wait for a green day

Shares
shares help the squeeze, long-term options aren't a bad play as it's genuinely turning itself around as a company, though shares get you in on that too.

Correcting probably
Buy the dip
why? what happened?
i personally believe its time to diamond hand - disclaimer, i have nothing to back this up other than blind hunch - this just feels to me like a healthy sell off, which for real people is normal, but for WSB is FD extinction.

After you lose enough to get out or have options expire and then watch it reverse.  Its called Max Pain theory plus the pain of seeing the reverse after you are out.

edit: The pain also occurs in bullet time
that's the spirit

Bought puts at 21 and it dropped 20.70 almost straight away.
Thats what I said, they dont want to have to buy Tesla at $700. Remember the higher Tesla market cap is the more they have to buy and at a higher price per share.

Im not allowed to say.
DM me for my venmo
Shoulder climbs into another head
Not locking in when the other 2/3 tanks.
I saw your comment and can confirm
SPCE has always been a gentlemen to me
Depends on how you think New Mexico lockdowns will go. If they keep Sierra County locked down, they can't do the test flight.
GME and INTC are rocking it!
Not to mention Chinese EV credit news
Not
just bought it, 100 shares it will moon 
up 3% already, bought in at the bottom, dont miss out idiots.
Depends, would you feel more stupid catching a blatant falling knife or missing the obvious recovery?

Bought DKNG 60c 5/21/21 @ 6.50 on 11/18, holding strong
Got 50K worth of shares holding until Superbowl.
I guess you had puts?
gave me a chance to reload some calls for end of december
Any EV if you're playing long term
something called palantir
Right
You just missed the bottom...
See you in 5 minutes.
Did you see the start over button? 
Let me know wed when you come back.
till it continues again. Jpow says we need stimulus or the stock market cant hold. Looks like his words are coming to reality since spy has reject 364 so many times.
Mines been in and out randomly along with RH. Shits fucking gay
For some reason this reminds me of The Last Samurai:

Soldier / Farmer: "...ss..ssamurai come!"

Tom Cruise: "Don't worry, son"

...entire regiment gets slaughtered and Cruise gets captured, learns dope sword skills, and hooks up with camp hottie.

Beeing poor is expensive.
Not selling AMD at $90 was the wrong move

I just bought more tho, not even sweating it for Dec 18
You should have seen SPY in March. $10 swings in minutes... insane.
Paper hand shakeoff and cyber monday flash sale?
Losing money wbu
some SQ, some of that CRM and some sweet sweet IWM dip
GME and PLTR shares
Nope... all good
same here man, crsr timing kings 
Its going to tickle 33 at some point today
After 2 month in coma, Tim    finally decide to wake up  
Doesnt the price go down even if it hits on the last day?
LOL same. I got buy restricted from buying back $24ccs on PLTR last week so its literally PLTR or nothing lol
You only lose when you sell
THIS IS THE ONE!!! PIC IS BEAUTIFUL

What do u do how bad is it
Probably one of the reasons suicides are at ATH

Random Money Generator.

I'm in
GME, PLTR
Just buy them. I think tomorrow is going to rip if this turns out to be an honest to god red day
puts bro puts.  
Was bullish af about GRWG but I sold my 12/4 calls before I could start bleeding. Still feel pretty bullish about it so may pick up 12/18 $35 calls
$27 18DEC picked up for me
Buy calls now
when was it not safe?
Same reason everything went down. Absolutely fucking nothing
Insiders making their millions
Bipartisan Relief talks
bold move retard
have it out til next week
The problem is that the stimulus provided by the bond purchases isn't reaching all the way down to the lower levels of the economy without a strong fiscal package from congress
Just high trade volume either way.
Why would you hold when you can sell and re buy
They'll get automatically switched over.
I have 12/18 $7.5c
Livin' lyfe on the fazt lame bb!
No retard. Even if it passes, it gives all the companies 3 years to comply
Sell BABA buy JD.

Stronger chart overall IMO. BABA has more room to climb but also hates being above $270 for some reason

JD I can see going back up to $90
BABA has enough monies to do anything it wants. It isnt going anywhere.
ck3
RMG do it.. thank me later. End of this year call
PLTR right?
MARA
Mara. Both very good riot is more stable and mara gives more profit. Careful about holding long because it can lose 50% in a day
Holding mara calls.
RIOT BABY
Not everyone. I have an IQ of 240
Last season was kinda trash too
i am
ur a   4 not buyin nekola we gonna go back up to high $65 in 2069

ur missin out on the longest pump and dump
If Apple drops this bitch going -3%.  Kinda dumb one company props up the entire market like this but whatever play their game
Youve got extra wrinkles
Sure sign of a pump and dump.
ive been buying SNAP for the past month and its so annoying how it has no problem dumping but the recovery is so slow it fucks up my calls. PINS on the other hand can dump 10% and recover 12% in an hour
I do both 
No
U sure about that? The competition is heating up in that area, brother, Comcast is offering free peacock player (priced normally at $5 a month) with tons of free content, now i hate Comcast with passion, but that on its own put some pressure on roku. Roku was a big fish in a small pond, but more and more bigger fish is jumping into that pond and it is starting to get crowded. Just my 0.02.
a ps5
Congrats for being the most retarded one on this sub. It's going to $15 EOW
I know nothing but they say there would be a squeeze bc of all of the shorts or something
unlikely. people don't seem to understand, the market doesn't care about past performance, it cares about how ur going to do in the future. if we get great guidance it will more than make up for lackluster performance in Q3. could be a small pull back after but definitely won't tank.
Solid
what winners do
can you find any reason?
Lol just so were clear

Last week it dropped that Pfizer would be approved by the end of the week and start vaccination Dec 1

Yesterday it dropped approval this week and start Dec 7

Now its hope by Christmas
Let's go 600 baby
595
.-. Im not even sure where to start. A call is a call dude. Aint no difference
One bought later one bought earlier. Theta decay will likely fuck the earlier guy. Let's assume they both bought at 45, the difference in gains will be due to theta.
Player 1 probs got some IV crush along the way and theta decay. Not that its worth more, but 2 probably made more yeah
Delta is more or less the probability the call expires in the money. If the stock experiences unusual volatility, that can make it more or less expire in the money. If it was ITM, that would decrease its value if volatility increases. If it was OTM, increased volatility would increase the price. This is captured in the IV and delta. 

Now, this is if the stock experiences *unusual* volatility. Whats happening with TSLA and PLTR today is par for the course, I dont think IV changed much.
You get refunded. Store credit though
Snap out of existence
They go bye bye
goes to president xi
They are transferred  to Hong Kong exchange, what do u think it happens? Also, they have 3 years to comply to the rules
I believe the bill says they have 3years to be audited, or be delisted.
You have options 3 years out?
[deleted]
I'm with you. Question now is whether to hold calls through the deal. Closing tomorrow allegedly.
You don't add stop loss on GME. It's gonna be a bumpy ride with hedgies fighting back. Gotta have 
it wasn't tesla...it was everything. we're looking better now tho 
Have no idea

Wish I bought as early as possible sigh
Just testing my sphincter?
Almost everything did.
Has been for awhile
What is that face
It hasn't gone down
I'm literally trading on edd money.  Dumped most of it into tesla
in september they did the LWA which entitled people to $300 a week ontop their EDD claim, though i havent heard much at work of counties issuing another type of program as of yet.
Best to play with shares and long hold than with options. Better returns over time.
No u
U is a unit. Usually contains 1 share of the SPAC and 1/3 or 1/2 of a warrant.
A "Unit" is some combination of Stock+Warrants.  Usually they split some time after listing, then you should have some amount of Stock and Warrants in your account.

Like PSTHU listed, then like a month later, they split into PSTH and PSTHW
Yeah but you cant swing trade or day trade in them. Its advised not to do risky trades in it because if you lose your money you dont get your contribution room back
Yeah but there are rules
Just make sure you dont make a ton of day trades.
Thats what tax free means.
yes
you also cant use losses which are going to be more likely if you have to asks this
Already on it. + 175 Oz physical. Lets get it
CRSR, big rally soon you heard it here first
Crsr
CRSR ALL IN
CRSR
PLTR
8k TSLA, 2k PLTR
Just so you know - bears are still accumulating.  Were actually waiting for next week.
maybe due to the dollar pumping which doesn't make sense but here we are
Yellen the dove appointed treasury secretary. It supposedly matters but really doesn't. Shows how stupid the street has become.
Fuck the chicken, we need to start sacrificing WSB users. The God's r pissed bro
I always make the wrong decisions, I am staying away from it today, but I have a feeling its going to break 500 after
\*here. Theyll beat but not by enough to justify redonk valuation, short.
I do, gut tells me to short it.
So with two people saying short and one person saying calls. I might have to do the stupid move and short it. Listening to the first comment and inverting it. Let's see what happens
absolutely yes
That spike looked fake on Yahoo finance until i checked my app, that shit already paid off lol
I own so many layers of 2.5p but I think this thing has legs until an actual SEC investigation brings it down.
what are you implying then?
Can you summarise for us retards ? Buy or sell ffs
Looks like controlled selling yeah 
Not just retail profit taking
I'm in the Corsair Ship let's fucking go
You telling me to buy?
So youre expecting a pump?
Good or bad?
finally back to even on my shares. I bought at the worst time...
Who?
Yeah Im out.
   
Yeah and I can guarantee you Taco Bell will make me shit. Pointing out the obvious isn't a superpower
the problem is that stocks like NKLA can stay retarded for a long time
mad hard to time broski
what would you get?
I told myself that yesterday but 360 is looking pretty strong. So I folded against my plan and bought some 365s
lol that was good
PLTR 1/15 30c not worried in the least
AMC lmao
SLV $25c for Jan is -90% right now 
RKT. Biggest piece of shit Ive been holding for longer than I care to admit.
MSFT
12/18 50c/55c vertical on CRSR. I'm breaking my own rule about dumping at 50% loss because it has 2 1/2 weeks to recover, and I believe it will get better, even if it doesn't go green.
baba, msft
Microsoft and LI and Apple
I have a Roku TV. Its pretty cool. Ok Im in
ROKU make u BROKU
JPOW speaks at 10am tmrw then on Wednesday it could be bumpy
Buy. Whole market is red. Just don't sell like a fucktard
GME
MSFT to $230 in the next 2 weeks.
Pltr
I was hoping soon. Opened a position on Chevron this AM, right before the world shit the bed.
No
haven't really been following either stock, but as a huge tech nerd it's pretty obvious that Intel has been having massive problems and AMD has been consistently pushing out really good shit recently
It will be double intel soon
If it's not worth more than Intel, then it's undervalued. Intel is dead for the foreseeable future and amd is just beginning to eat it's entire market. 5 years from now and every server, desktop, and laptop will be amd.
Until it's valued twice Intel, because it is now a better company.
Buying tesla is always right, longterm
Lots of relative strength today. Wish I added to my position but tricky market today.
Cyber Monday sales! Apples never on sale
You got Nikola Puts as well?
If they theta is decent, it's better
shares dont have theta decay
Stock runs big = better, modest gains or decline over holding period = worse. Shares dont have time decay. LEAPS have a lot. Every day that the price is flat you lose money.

Stock goes up 8% in a year. You own shares? Congrats you made 8%. You own LEAPS? Congrats maybe you broke even
yeah..my Dec 18 and Dec 24  $85 calls were sold way too soon..still profit, but this would have been nice. This shit cycles like a fucking squirrel on cocaine.
I sold most all of my call positions last week after 2 months of sideways trading. I dont feel too bad cause I put most of it into GME shares/calls and also made like 4K on spy puts and PLTR calls that I wouldnt have been able to buy if I didnt.
looks like the viagra wearing off now
Why aren't they doing it now?
So many $10 puts its not even funny 
Got murdered by them in September. Never again
12/3. Careful with that play, they're still up bigly from lows. GL
Just bought Jan 21 calls. What's the target company?
UwU shaped recovery
WW recovery
I think it follows AAPL
And 363
How long?
Delayed until April
IV still low-ish too
Nah
Ill say no for now. Nio will report November numbers this week. December will lag for them until we make it to the excitement for Nio day
NIO rocket  out of fuel :/
Not before JPOW speaks tommorow
Yep
Yeah man been holding this thing since the last time it popped to ~90.. It looks like it's primed for another good run.

But... I really want more GME! 
damn I could buy 76 hot n spicy mchickens with that
let me know. Holding $15k worth leaps, while rest of retards are making money off PLTR and GME
yeah sure, in approximately 10 years
cut bait, live to fight another day.... PLTR has taken too many WSB scalps as it is....
Nice
I wanna park all my cash in it. Seems solid af
Some guy has a shitty DD post where he drew some triangles, so there is that
 Not sure considering they just lost the Chinese market which is either number 1 or 2 market depending who you ask
2-3 years once their new silicone or whatever it is processors and gpus are compatible with all software itll be the most sustained and will become even harder to posses therefore definitely gonna be one of the first to become 3T mc
on those blue chips, never expect miracle growth. Instead, expect miracle failure and buy the dip before return to normalcy.

Everytime someone tells you "so and so stock will be X by Year X" just ignore it. Instead sniff blood in the water and go in when it feels low.
EOW
PLTR 
AAPL calls

Sounds like bullshit to me. 

Vaccine by may. Demand only moving one direction longer term. May move down some shorter term on fears of another lockdown or general slowdown. But vaccine coming. Demand only going up.
Im up like $2k doing that would be up $5k if I held my positions just one more day each
Just use your hands on your dingy.

im never playin jinko again
I though the rumor was the dog is a sleeper agent
Acquisition is never bullish for the buyer because they have to spend cash
Because everyone uses Teams, if they bought Teams, moon.
Cause their shares will get diluted. Same thing happened to AMD. It always happens when a company decides to acquire a new company. The one getting bought goes up and the one buying goes down.
Fuck me... I hesitated today to buy them when they were +20%... and I didn't when they were +30%... and not they are +50%... someone pls bitchslap me.
I'm bullish on AAPL here with SPY/MSFT down and it soaring. I think we break out of this channel we've been trading in soon
Yes
Yes... username
Im in 
Wish I had been smart enough to do that. :/

Probably just profit taking, 10% a day makes a stock go gay

Damn, I only figuratively bought the dip
go for it

Stop reading doom and gloom news.
I have two very long calls thinking about adding, any suggestions?
Whats the thinking here
Reason why? I\`m debating whether it will rise or go down even more
Psth
\+95% today!
I wanted to buy in when it was only 30% up, but it\`s over now I guess
Why
PLTR calls winning??? Last week yeah
hes gonna dilute?

Finally some movement, while the rest of my portfolio goes down. STONKS!
Couldn't stand Schwab, moved to Fidelity back in January.  
Honestly, can't imagine going through March with Schwab.
They're a VERY solid dividend stock. They don't see a shitload of stock movement cause of the dividends. From my very limited research they seem to be the only company actually going hard to install, and actually give updates on, their mmwave 5G installation. mmwave is the super fast 5G with a super short range if you didn't know. It's the 5G everyone wants.
VZ is better than T imo.  VZ isn't still paying a CEO dumb enough to buy DirecTV.  Still a Boomer play though.
No the longer you hold it the more worth it gains
If it doesnt hit the strike price by exp yes
Ok, this is the part where I beg you to read 15-20 minutes about calls and puts.  Watch a 10 minute video, something.  You should NOT be investing in options until you have a basic understanding of the terminology and how the make and lose money.  Not hating, just don't want to see you bust out because you weren't sure what you were buying.
Is it ITM?
Becky need some BBC

nah mrna kinda iffy

Hell yeah

I used to run hella ark... I love it, but now I am kinda worried ab biden restricting tech corps powers and post-covid slow down on tech. Jets will be a good bet until airline stocks are semi back to normal. And you can never go wrong w VOO

Consider oil etfs if u trade in the short term on the etf account
Eyeing the too for some time now, but they don't seem too promising...

You still in?
massive amounts of stock will hit market tomorrow. dont think its anywhere close to hitting its bottom. company is a sham
Are you making a play on it ?
it's never too late to get into an ETF

There is a big insider selling in NET (CEO, CFO< Directors). That might affect the price negatively.
Double dick? Is that like when you wear a chindo too?
>ven't heard in a long time

honeycrisp or GTFO
I'm pretty sure there are a lot of PLTR holders with short-term calls in the sub that are, in fact, losing today.
Yes
BABA isnt safe until mid December
It shouldn't affect BABA but ofcourse it will because investors are sheeple and will panic sell if it passes even though has zero relevance to BABA.
The vote is on Wed right?
I sold by baba calls today

Edit - still holding baba stock. Going to sell a covered call
Mj etf or apha

Why do people keep posting these salty comments? I don't see anyone saying they're buying NKLA, so there's no one you're responding to.
You mean a glorified EV marketing company with no proprietary tech shouldn't moon????
It's a company that lied to investors and got caught. The chance for an upside is really low.  They could announce good news and no one would believe them.
Yes setup Twitter notifications and then every time they trash a stock buy it. Its honestly the most accurate bullish indicator I have found

Mara has burned me before. Fuck that ticker
Probably get a nice bump from the Tesla inclusion. Maybe two if they split it. But I also got 12/31 400c because Im retarded gambling addict that loves losing money.
And the 20 ERs before that it did exactly shit. I know, I once bought a straddle on that at ER, y nada. I switched and then sold iron condor. Oh, but a few weeks later after the blackout window, they deployed their buybacks squads and ruined my iron condor. Hate that fucking company.
Lose another $2000/month
make room for another window with pornhub on it
Retard youve 8 months lol, why are you even playing options with such nerves
It is, theyre deciding how it will be included. Whether its all at once, two chunks, whether they offer more shares, etc
How to incorporate tsla, not if they will
not really, the run up has been epic this previous month. I think they are a little over heated right now. I think they pull back another 5-8% in the next two weeks.
Air Canada Trudeau announcing cash for them today
do you think after the pandemic air travel will go back to where it was?

Thats why Im loading up today before the news tonight
Every week you should double down on the top fifteen performers.
same same. but at 90
 The only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&P 500 inclusion ***thingy***. 

'nuff said
Comparing the Tesla run-up to the dot com bubble/Yahoo being the most upvoted thing on r/investing is so on brand its painful.

2022 is going to be an insane year for theaters. Buy 2023 leaps
I think the hope is that they get bought, but I will be going to the theatre the first chance I get to safely do so
amzn can wipe you completely or give you the biggest gains. i tried back in april and got wiped though if you can time the run up my lord youll rack in cash
Did you google if TSLA volatility could tank the index? What was the first result there?
I mean, if enough people think it will then it will.
Flat. I would love to see a spike, but I don't think it will right before a potential big announcement.
Tonight is full moon, you know what that means.
False
no, no it's not
im banking on them long term, assuming they actually sell something. They're backed by VW and bill gates so if they can develop a good battery VW is one of the biggest car companies in the world.

Eventually I think it will overtake NIO too. However, I think it was pumped way too quickly and is overvalued for what they offer
Last I read they said either Thursday or friday.
Wait and you'll be late. Jump in while it's cheap
Bought puts.
People are willing to pay more for a piece of the company.
cntrl f?
MRNA already took off. Its like trying to catch a moving train
why, why are there amazon bulls back in here. Im a perma one but i dont see why its bullish?
Heard your comment on the synth just as I was about to execute a call on GOLD... dammit, back to puts I guess
What stock?
Why should that be rejected forcefully?
It was a nice wake up.
All in on weed all the time
Nah, just AAPL. Weed will be the flavor of the week till Wed when the senate rejects it.
Ur dumb
You cant buy calls in premarket correct? So you placed them before hours and then the price changed so thats why they didnt buy.
Yeah I lost my apha calls on rh. Lucky for me I was on at the bell and watched them not place so I cancelled and did them. Still ate some gains though. Currently my profile looks fucked up on the main screen too. Time to look for a better app
That's not robinhood that's you not knowing what your doing
You should look into thinkorswim, interactive brokers or tasty works (you get free stocks/options for new acct)
You answered your question. PFE is more established and a much bigger company. The revenue from the vaccine is a drop for PFE while it will be significant for MRNA
PFE has most of their business in regular pharma stuff, so their vaccine will only be a small amount of revenue. And their vaccine requires sub zero temperatures, so its more expensive to transport and not practical for rural/underdeveloped areas. 
Moderna vaccine doesnt require the same sub zero temperature during transport and storage. And vaccine sales for them will be a more substantial part of their overall revenue.
Covid vaccine doesnt move PFE earnings. MRNA vaccine is much better, and their CEO said they will be able to do thousand more vaccines using same technology
No lol
Never too late for a RIOT.
I sold my pltr for riot
Thats because they want me to buy them. I got this I got this
little if any
ZM had a direct correlation to DOCU during last earnings period. DOCU mooned to $280 but then tanked after it's own earnings.
Got out this morning. Literally at this point I might get back in and buy EOD and sell at open.
Whens the vote happening?
If you want to be a true gambler, sure

Friday is when Congress votes on removing certain Chinese tickers from the market

As far as I know, NIO and XPEV aren't on the list but it would be a downturn for all China tickers if it passes
Wondering the same.
I find playing earnings in general to be a bad idea cause of IV crush
Earnings are only good if you buy early before the IV run up and get out before EC and IV crush.
Cuz its a shitty company
just swing trade it. When its -15%, buy, and when its +20% sell. Rinse, repeat, and you made a lot more money in 1 year than holding leaps
only reason i'm not is cuz i'm all shares and dont wanna pay the short term tax man
bullish flow
Look at the charts. Bull flag, aka the wedge. Looks like its gonna rocket up according to TA
Its finally movin and u wanna cash out?
Nothing
Unless the senate votes to remove them from US markets for not having audited financials 
not really
Narrator: or so he thought
think thats a buy or sell?
What are you, a fucking weenie

*not financial advice
Hold
This shit isnt going down until after inclusion. PT also getting increased left and right with claims saying it has plenty of room to grow mid-long term. Anything dated in January or later should be held.
moderna puts and  bntx call. btw, check redhill biopharma
I know, such a disappointment to be up less than 5% it feels like Im down 20

Odds on it dumping tomorrow?
Cauliflower is the future

What strike price? Nio day might give it a good boost
Tomorrow
By when?
Try again plz
Yea will this stock is really wild so pro advice no

Do it on some other stock
You're in the wrong place
i sold covered 35c weeklies
Thats what Im worried about also

Would rather just buy back in tomorrow morning

People are so greedy sometimes
Depends. Being added in parts is kinda bearish short term but mid-long term this is still goin up.
Up and down while maintaining a lateral trajectory
Already being added in parts..today is announcing the split/ratio of which percentage when.
Its going up me and stock moe did a lot of DD on this one this stock is a winner
Pahmp eeeeet
Theta strategies lose less often but when you do lose...you lose bigly. Getting assigned on a credit spread sucks ass
Theta Gang always wins
Sounds like something Theta gang would say
Pltr sell puts
Fuck jnug
Must feel good
Haaa could you imagine
I had calls. Any other questions? Me and Tesla really don't have good chemistry
Do it now before close Im already up 50%

Yes actually lol
Tim was just tired of you retards talking shit about his baby
Up big. They just signed a new partnership. Green energy will be up huge for Biden. Ive made good $$$ on PLUG and plan to make more
Hold the line

Vote comes between Wednesday and Friday
What did you buy in at bro? I reckon it will continue to go up until the vote
Up 12% and asking for a pump, wat
Still a solid day and, gods willing, no real dump. Pretty healthy price action. Shot up to 12.50, fell below 12, then tested 12 a lot. There are probably a ton of early november bagholders happy to get out.

Would be nice to see another pump above 12 but i'll setlle for stabilizing above 11.50. Should have decent buying support at least until the day of the US vote. Then it's all up in the air whether the price maintains despite knowing it's DOA in the Senate.
I diversified but Im still dying???
So... pltr AND gme?
fuck SPACs. gg to those who are making money on them, all it did was take my money out of play on other shit that I could've actually profited from. Takes way too much engagement to keep an eye on them. And then they idle or go sideways for months. Shoot up 10/20/30% and back down. Repeat til merger. Tank after merger.
everyone gotta bite off a big ole chunk of tsla soon
GME

Puts or calls?
People who like money
Did you mean Amd 100c?
Eod
it'll pullback tomorrow
Just do it, idiot. It's gonna moon any day this week.
no

Its so overbought on almost any time scale longer than a week
^oh ^no ^dont ^do ^it
Buy shares
lol the options contracts are so cheap... 5c haha was tempted but like it would've needed to keep mooning at this rate rofl

Pity party
PTSH
TSLA COVERED CALL
Puts on Costco, ex div date is tomorrow for the special $10 dividend.
Not a damn call, I promise you that.
NKLA calls?!?
DUMPKINGS
 And ant ipo not happening till 22
how long it will take to go to 100
To go up, if you're sidelined...
I think the consensus is tank. But ive never been through an inclusion
If Elon decides to issue more stock then itll probably tank. That is super unlikely though. If they announce one date of inclusion then itll be a huge bull run up to that date. If its two dates then I can see a mediocre run up to the first date, then a dump. Then a run up to the second one, then another dump.
Fairly certain it and zm both crash AH so I reversed myself and bought calls on both.
Fairly certain it and zm both crash AH so I reversed myself and bought calls on both.
i believe it doesnt really matter since multi also is just 2 days of buying
Single. Itll pump so hard before it crashes just as hard after the date.
People are not nervous about single or multiple tranch. They are worried about potential delay in the 2nd tranch eg. postponed to next quarter in march
We rip tomorrow. This is just profit taking for EOM.
The prolly just daytraders exiting
day traders ditching, big money waiting on announcement and buying once it hits the lower bound of the current range.
People are skeptical about the S&P 500 update announcement coming later today - which just clarifies the percentage of when what amount is being added.
who
Melt up then 50% drop in January sometime probably
Link to confirm theyre reporting tomorrow?
Take profit. Unless you can see the future.
>level 1silverlink22201112:10:31 point  just nowPosting One more time because its wild. Its official. Yall convinced me to never ever buy puts again. This happens everytime. Literally deposited 2k and back to where I s

I dumped my 15c for 12/18..  I was bagholding it for awhile - ya know.  got take what I can
K
Hope you got some long dated ones. Holding Apr 21 calls and they are up 55%. Easy money play
12/18 80 up 15% so far
All ev is down on nikola and some short seller saying Kandi is hot garbage.....no one disputes nio, it actually just got an upgrade to 54
Nio will get a bump from November delivery numbers.
I bought more NIO on the dip. Delivery numbers out this week, and people freaking out about the audit thing.
Ok. I looked. Whats up?
35
its going to go up, down or flat
We obviously have no idea, but stinks only stonk
needs to get pumped again
lol of course those fucks! :( JFC hahah
Looks legit
Took the EV sector with it
Coz they r gey,
It'll get bought up like $PLUG and hardly make a dent. PLTR has investors on board that appreciate big tech for what it is, a perspective few boomer types actually have, hence it's tard strength.
Recovery incoming
$450P 12/11
12/18 300p
It fucked me
Hope you bought weed
Sold my $6Cs for 220% rolled all of it into YOLO $15 1/15/21s 

Lmao
Einstein.
Two things

1) smoke weed everyday

2) play the weed stocks, it's free money with house vote incoming later this week
2 hard to time :(
[deleted]
Why
Puts? Everything is on sale atm, so if you're bullish, I'd say you should've bought now rather than at open
Im out of power... buying this dip... when do we resume the pumps?
Fuckers run crying at the first hint of red 
Why do you think it will continue to go up?
I was going to.  Everyone is saying it should be mid-low 30s
355
Why
Why?
Because rich people wanna lower the price to buy in cheap
Cause retailers are scared for some reason. Probably cause of the way the rest of the market moved. Im not worried about it.
exactly LOL dumb
IT WORKED BEAR R FUK
Nkla Puts NOW Lockup expiring tomorrow no GM deal
RIOT 12/4 calls
Tsla
NKLA poots
Dont force it
Gme
By a ball
hold it

Usually
lots of stocks did
Time to buy calls then.
IV wasnt really too high when I checked earlier today. Dont see a crush happening unless it goes absolutely crazy.
I'm in as well. I guess I've got a partner to ride the ship to hell with if we fail...godspeed
You'll find out tomorrow. 161 million shares will be eligible for sale 
Not at all
The only BECKY stocks I remember are TGT, ULTA, and PTON. I'd put AAPL in there too but idk if that was official. What else is in there
woah yeah. somethin just aint right with that boy
Hahaha same.. lol down -20% to only-.4%.. i call that a win
Market is always boring af in december
Nov technically

Nope. why would they, they just love taking tendies. And also WHY TF ARE WE TAKING ADVICE FROM A LEMON 
I'm actually jacked to the TITS rn in CRM bull spreads I opened at 239$ those massive green dildos at close brought up my portfolio a Whopping 13% by close
no, not really

a holiday boom has already been priced in
not when everything is out of stock to start \*HONK\*
Yea it dipped so that means December is extra bullish instead of normal bullish. If you bought the dip you won at life this month
on the morrow
Too expensive. Real plays are going to be on the first biotech to bring a vaccibody and at home rapid test kit.
No idea.  This sub is auti.....wait nvm
Who knows which ones get the big win and the rest take losses? Who would have predicted NVAX after all the news about MRNA and AZN? I'm long on mrna but it feels like a crap shoot
i fucked up and bought pfe stock lol.

whats your play on those two?
Downgrade account from gold
a real broker will remove it if you call and ask nicely.  seriously.
Call them  ha
Youll be fine
Most people bought at 18 or 19, you're going to be fine
You bought calls or shares?
It went up 50% in two weeks and needs a profit taking session
Glad I was out of day trades 
freaking love newegg. They doing good from my house.

Edit: PAMP ET
Biggest losers group, WSB GAY BEARS 
You should have jumped into ETSY today then. I just locked in gains on ETSY calls this morning, and she is tanking fast.
At time of post (29 mins ago): Pltr = $30.15

Now: $27.9

&#x200B;

Looks like the bears were right indeed, GET FUKT LMAO
How u doin fam 
Cgc still had room to climb
Did you even graduate from HS yet?
Unfortunately we live in a time line where this type of person is more likely to get rich than someone who cares about others lol
I hope you're joking...

Everything is red today you mook

Bruh we cant moon every day moron. This is why your account is negative.
Yeah it was fun while it lasted

Horse shit
Yup and making money doing it.
Online game libraries dont exist
Lol. Did u missed out on tiny training video someone posted yesterday on wsb?
Microsoft owns their company
I don't get it either but these autists keep money on it. I'm tempted to put on my helmet and eat some crayons with them
Short squeeze coming thats why
Seriously. With the pandemic and everyone being tight on money, who won't buy the digital edition of PS5 and XBox Series X. Maybe they're set to make big gains on the little bobbleheads and shirts they sell? Because physical media like discs are going to only keep value because of the resale value.
No, fucking buy now before you miss out on this 50 bagger, we're going to force these fuckers to cover these 70 million shares
NO!!?
Buy now there's a decent dip after a good rise today! Buy shares to fuck w/ these big bank short sellers!
Give it like 30 seconds


Edit: there ya go
More like he made the top
Except he bought in on Friday
If it goes under 20 I will sell everything Im in and go all in
hoping your right buddy
Everybody wins
Retard strength of WSB will take till to 30 lol
This guy getting banned 100% for using the f word
Let the dip happen
Whats your play?
Can't get taxed if it's all losses. Big brain plays
Imagine thinking capital gains are an issue in WSB.
We gucci if we poor right? Isn't that for >1 mil
Taxes - is this some peasant term Im too wealthy to understand?
What's it going to?
Ban

Were on GameStop now
What is your advice based on?
Go back to your cave 
Terrible advice
Its still up 6% today retard
to buy shares not calls
No you cant they dont want any Crpyto talk
Legit commodity but whatever.
Buy puts then tough guy
My march and may calls are fine. This shit will pump sooner or later. The weekly is dead though.
7k shares, average cost basis 10.40 (actually lower because i have sold tons of covered calls). im up over 100k so far
This is too funny lmao, glad I have a put, shit was obvious.
Lower highs and lower lows and these dudes still saying 40 EOW
But it's not just PLTR. The whole market seems to be bouncing.
Hey I'm kind of new at all of this, who are the rainbow bears and who are the Bull? Im guessing it has to do with their trading strategy?
It ran to $40.55 in premarket, it's currently at $39.75 ...  


The only thing in here pumping is you...
Basically the same
I always read it as ACAB
I'd like to pipe some ACB.
No one gives a rats ass about this Amy lady, 420 BLAZE IT!!!!
Fuck that! All in rn
Same here
Little bit, my bitch mechanic is out working on it right now. Should be back up and running in a few minutes.
just profit taking lol u must have bought like friday or something if ur worrying about that
Come join GME
You've heard all the tales of paper hands. You really want  your own story adding to that?
Yeah I just cut my losses on it. Probably gonna switch to puts for its ride down assuming it breaks support
But ride the pump a little first.
I like money so I will not be doing that
Its over
Unless you like 
Im free rolling but I still think its Blockbuster
loser
upvoted but I dislike you as well, so I hope you also get wiped
same. sold my PLTR shares earlier... using all of those funds to buy calls.
I threw a 120 on a 30 dollar weekly 10 mins ago. It aint much but I trust the process
Scared money doesnt make money
If its from 11/24 it isnt new.
Shorts working overtime right now to keep it suppressed.
Its fucking GameStop what did you people actually expect?

Wut? PLTR is back from being at -12%
Wut? PLTR is back from being at -12%
Always
this is what checking this sub is like lol
Its up 9% relax
Well close at +13% is my guess
What did you buy it at?
Bro theres like a 10 minute waiting time just to get into their website right now.
It's up 10% today and like 80% in a month? What the fuck else do you call that
the physical stores r dead, the online stores, + they now get a cut of every Digital game sold on the Xbox and PS store
Lol maybe if your buying weeklies
Gotta big spender over here!!
I dont know what they do and im retarded so i bought some calls
45 EOD. Feel it in my bones.
Careful, mods here are very against brigading other subs and that's skirting the line (at least mentioning it here)
I sold all my stocks expecting a dip this next few weeks/months
just fake algo cocks back and forth
For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother 
Same.
Partial, gradual and micro calls on Tesla !
ppl keep saying NIO is dead and it's like wow....can we have a LITLLE bit longer of memories and a LITTLE BIT MORE PATIENCE?!? It's so clearly going up on the next catalyst I'm a fool not to have options
Nio is not worth a 60B market cap dog.
NIO 80+? Not for half a year probably brother
Is Li no longer in the picture for serious gains? I know about the NIO and Xpeng charging station partnership, but Li has been regressing hard
Got back into some calls today - bounced off the 200 on the 15m chart. Has been a place of support since start of rally beginning November.
by your logic, why didnt tesla moon every battery day? Its priced in....
shambles that we didnt buy more
on what news
Hey you didnt respond to the 8 useless emails I sent you over the weekend... can we schedule a 4pm conference to discuss your commitment to our team?
Shell get promoted over you for doing less work as well because of political correct office politics  as well
You done with trading?
Next time do it right at open if you don't have the guts for this game.  You would have actually made some money for being a wuss.
Coward, lol.

Actually, you may prove to be the smartest person here with that move. :)
Let it accumulate. Aint no issue
Flatlined
I was thinking of getting back in but now I'm not sure, have a bad feeling it will dump this afternoon. If I go in it will punish me for greed, if I don't then it will moon again lol.

Dont you dare
Why would you do that? What price did you get in?
AAPL like an old man without his viagra. 0.39% up pre-markt.
Poor BABA cant catch a damn break lately. 
I mean, we almost hit it on Friday
Once it breaks through 600 its going straight to 700. Maybe not today but later this week/early next week.
Cant buy on RH. They think users too dumb to differentiate between warrant and stock.
You cant, get a real broker instead.
GME
GME has all of December.
You thought about making money?
APEX
There's literally memes all around you.  
  
APHA, NIO, TSLA, CRSR, PLTR, GME, PSTH, THC or any other SPAC that I can't mention sub $1bn.  
  
It's obvious that your testicles are innies.
Dude apha is pumping nicely, then again I bought in at 6.20 last week
BLNK puts

Someone should spam that idea on his Twitter so he can't sell that "idea" to idiots believing him.
No.
Sure

No
Only if you go all in
If you do sell it once youre up 25%+
Good
Average at 25 easy
25
65 is too old I would take 55 tho
If Im not dead by 65, Ive done something wrong
65 too risky imo

Edit changed my mind 65
Nice, don't have to use any form of birth control.
Dude, 65?  


&#x200B;

Hard pass.
65
I think yall underestimating how ugly the average person is. Ill take a 65 year old smoke any day.
explain to me like im 5 what you are trying to say
Can't the former CEO officially sell shares today?
GM wants no part of their gravity-powered trucks but needed to save face.
Did you not see the short seller report? They signed the MOU and then Nikola pushed a vehicle down a hill. Things changed and GM said fuck that.
How does NKLA roll an empty chassis down a hill and turn camera sideways to imply that its driving?

This shit smells real fucking stinky. Something is not going up as gravity appears to be the only force acting upon it
might go lower tbh, keep close eye at open
Good idea.
If worse comes to worse youll be a bag holder for a few months.
Do you plan on holding them for a year+? Then no, not a bad idea. There are probably 1,000 worse ideas mused over here everyday.
i like Dec 2021 leaps
Waiting for sub 35
Nice I love Corsair. Got their LED water cooler in my PC. Good company
Thccbsh is still gapped haha
Spac = space = rocket = share price go up
Just needs news
Good Executives make/break thats for sure
Huntsman wound up pretty successful.
Buying the dip on NKLA puts when these retards cause a dead cat bounce

Pew pew mothafucka. Pew pew
What a dingus.
This is the way
short squeeze
Short squeeze nothing else that I can see.
dont hold till deal is done
Today. 

Just keep YOLOing. 

It works every time that it works.
Never
If it goes to $18 I will eat my own sh*t
yikes
Paper hands dont belong in GME gang
Rebuy you fking toilet paper hands
Paper hands
Taking a shit this morning
Straight up not having a good time
Low market cap on that one careful mentioning it in the sub. I am in it. Looks like a healthy pullback. Longterm hold
Feeling great watching the numbers not change on my buying power.
You realize that it is up 3% today, right?
APHA is better
Maybe not today but def over the week
I know that feel
I sold all my positions last Friday, bought pltr at $18, sold when it was $30. All cash right now going to gobble up the dip
Yeah Im cash gang watching charts looking into some plays to get into EOD. Sold my BABA calls for loss this morning. Shouldve known better than fucking with that stock with the situation its in
I got out at open for 25% gains, Godspeed
Nobody knows. Thats the honest answer
No, they were just bitches
Because even they know its bouncing back hard
What strike?
IV was retardedly high. Made 10% on my total holding selling covered calls with a $30 strike
Theta gang gettin u

What strike price
Better sell those before its too late
Same lol
Definitely looking good
Theyll just issue more shares and fuck you
People seem to be swing trading  imo
bro buy right now. Look at it.
whats your next move?
is IV/theta killing you?
Just complete legit opposite of what every I do not even theta
It has to be a curse cant be anything else like for example Friday market closed I wanted to get into gme failed now Monday it moons this happened legit every time this has to be a curses logic cant explain it
X
Well they bought in on Friday so he was bullshiting
Because it is Gamestop... In 2020...
Great! All my money was in weed stocks friday and I rotated into SPXU this am.
Stay strong matey
People see one small dip and sell everything. Retards.
looking like complete bullshit rn
Wait for $20
Buy NIO
no, let it dip more
sold my 17.5 12/4 calls for a pretty penny this morning right after open.
Nobody likes you
good work!
Same. Funny enough, the PLTR pumper gave us who stayed one day too long a chance to exit
Why
Happy cake day
perfect day to buy thicbb
Big bois need some dip to load up TSLA   
Not as dumb as your dad for not pulling out.

Edit: 
Stay vibing boomer
Pltr
Hope youre doing well.
You are awesome
Hope you well homie

Sold PLTR on Friday at open, you are nice person and a great tutor
You are loved.
I hope youre having a great day
I hope green follows you everywhere buddy
Shut up bitch

Thank you for the gold kind stranger
Good morning, you precious human being.
Interesting piece of shit comment to state when you know I am entitled to Diamond
im gonna fuck you so deep in your poopchute
pussy
i rememver that crazy 3000% gain day. rode the pump from 24.10 to 32.20, netting 30% in 10min
The only things worth buying from Amazon on a discount day are amazon devices. And lots of people don't even want those
Yes well, the run 6 months ago already priced it in, I think
Idea: Peter Thiel is like the hard ass hetero version of you
I did too bought at 25, dont know about 31 eod tho
If I can recover my calls, I'm just gonna buy shares tbh. It's a solid company but trying to time these swings is ruinous.
GME...lol
Hold
HOOOOOOLD
im diamond handing it
Hold until NIO day at least
Hopefully you didnt. Now is the climb back up. If you bought in that dip your cash is secured.
You shouldnt be trading options , it sounds like to me. At least stop selling calls
Peppermint straight up the pooper
Not anymore
RIGGED COUNT!
SO SAD! FRAUD!

Hasn't it been selling all day?
Literally risk free.
Word on the street is theres a pump tomorrow
It's a little gay.
Kinda is if you have SPY calls... that being said I do have one VXX call to hedge a little loss but Im balls deep in 365 12/4s
If a 1% drop is winning for them thats a sad existence

Because no one really thinks there will be a civil war at this point?
Because your paranoid feelings really are just delusions.

People arent that scared I would assume
Because you have calls

Buy shares not options ya ding dong.
Idk but someone bought a bunch of my 29c for $100 each. Theta and IV are gonna eat those up
Whats your cost basis
What was your entry point and where is it at now? are you green? are you red?
if this happened i would coom
Don't worry about Trevor, he's a fuck boi who created NOTHING of value
They didn't. His lockup ends tomorrow and even at current price, it's worth billions to him. Even if GM waited til after he sold all his shares and then announced they're buying NKLA for $100/share, he'd still be a billionaire.
?
This is the way
Shit is RIPPIN
Reported for using big letters.
Its what you end the year with
Super rudimentary tax answer - don't ask a forum of mostly teenagers with under $1,000 account balances for tax help. 

You're welcome future friendshabitsfamily
Where youre at at the end of the year, I think
no to the former
Assuming no wash sales

Taxed on 8k gains
Depends on the account value at end of the year
It will be based on your P/L on December 31
Not going to get into wash sale rules which you definitely should read up on but generally speaking outside of wash sales only 8k is taxable.
Net realized gains/losses is all that matters
Short term losses offset short term gains. You'll pay tax on your net realized profit.

For anything you've held for less than 1 year, it will be taxed as normal income.
Depends if the gains are realized or mark to market.  PayPerTrade is clueless.
Look up loss harvesting. People close out loss-making positions at the eoy to lower their tax burden. This wouldn't exist if it wasn't based on your eoy net.
The wash sale rule makes it super complicated. If youve been buying and selling contracts for the same ticker, then likely you wont be able to directly deduct your capital losses, but will have to add your losses to your cost basis on your gains. Since you still have overall gains, it should still work similarly for you.
Im in at $17 ish. Happy at $20. Really happy at $22. All short term like 7-10 days.
Shares now, fds Weds or Thurs at market close premiums are reeeee rn
Get in now and hold till earnings which is on the 8th..

Lets hope it doesnt dump tomorrow
What's the play tho
Pitter patter

Nope, check UK and AUS market. Absolute nosedive.
Arent you worried itll drop tho

No. The S&P announces the inclusion dates and amounts only. The indexes that BM against it will be governed by their prospectuses for how they handle the switch. Some of them are already buying rn.
I sold out for a small gain on my 12/4 $95 calls. I thought they were dead until today.  Bought them early last week.
wait 1 day
3pm is usually when they sell them automatically. Good luck dood
Sell before the house vote on decriminalization, wait on the dip and buy back in.
Sold it for 2k profit, covering the PLTR loss of 1k
Yeah, AAPL is basically flatlining... going into cardiac arrest.
Upgraded price target to $191 by Morgan Stanley
It's been down since Sept 3rd... so it's about fuckin time.
Because its been consolidating like a motherfucker for nearly 2 weeks.

It was due for a breakout.
Price target upgrades I believe
Was heavily shorted.
Potentially in this coming year if Dems take the Senate, basically never if the Republicans keep it.
Really tempting
Id send if it wasnt 300 bucks. That seems kinda nuts to me because realistically it should be around 40$
Shit stock, why did I fomo
Blue Chip

Take the gains
Last time when fiasco with Trevor it went done to 17.9, so idk what to tell you! I would sell half of them at least

Rooting for eagles, betting on hawks
Hawks for sure
Seahawks, how is that even a question lmao
I'm with the Hawks. Bet on Pat's yesterday.
Eagles have the worst QB1 in the league. Hawks cover easy
I mean to be clear, still a 3% gain on a red day.  Looked like a lot more at open but its not exactly a fire sale.  Paper hands just taking profits is all.
Bruh you have a 130k salary, you'll live
Wtf do you at 24 with 130k a year salary?
I'm basically in the same boat. I think I have a gambling addiction and I can't stop fuck
The fuck you make 6 figs salary already and u depressed?
cope bagholder
Ask your dad for more "salary"
What industry bruh
What do you do that you draw that salary at 24?!
I make half as much as you but have twice as much saved. You wasted your time getting a 4 year CS degree, didn't you?
What do you do for a living?
Wahhhhh just do coke like everyone else
Is Pltr the way?
im highly jealous
Instructions clear. Buying the dip.
No.
maybe if youre holding weeklies
yeah, all the retards moved to GME

From WV and live here now after living in Minneapolis and Portland for about 7 years. It's insane how cheap houses are here. It's also insane how stupid most people around you are though. 
Almost did this
Age? What job?

7 years in IT, not even at 80k salary nor perm WFH. Feelsbadman
Can probably get a decent house for about that amount monthly in West Virginia.
Imagine moving to Bali instead, where luxury airbnb house is 700$ per month. You welcome for the tip
Now imagine having to live in WV . You might as well live in Walmart.
you show me a check for 100k and I work for you
who wants to live in West Virginia?!
Truth
I made so much money on GME today that I honestly cannot even imagine how dumb you are to say that.  Even by WSB standards you are clearly extra stupid.
Yes daddy.
he's not lying.
Between now and April
Have you read anything? It could be now or a year from now.
You didn't get the memo? The squeeze is scheduled for tomorrow at 10:18am.
It's up 10%+ today. What is wrong with that?
If the float stays where it is, there will never be a massive squeeze. If wsb can weaponize their autism like never before, 3:17pm today
Bamboozled again by autism.
Markets are completely divorced from the real economy, not even the pandemic could overcome the tidal wave of liquidity. This was not supposed to be possible according to conventional thinking. I hope we never find out what can beat free money. History says there are always invisible fault lines, but it's been a long-ass time riding this wave.
You gUys told mE it would quAdruple in onE dAy and then it didN't and nOw I'm sAlty!!

When is this webcast?  Looking for it, but no links.
PLTR and GME to the moon 
GME for highest possible reward
Yes
@mods ban this kid
Name a few
to hold for a decade, yes

to play for a squeeze, no
Prediction: a car company that sells 10,000 cars a year shouldnt have a 50 billion evaluation, I got in at 28 with shares and im out since friday, gl
The sub has quite a short attention span. Here's hoping that the week holds catalytic good news for NIO.
[removed]
let me grab my magic 8 ball
soon? it popped to $20 pre-market, if that's the kind of rally we get, shorts will be shitting themselves
truth help
With the attention it's getting now, it should be really soon. I'm gonna yolo into 12/18 19 calls.
Soon 
u think 650 by close?
This guy gets it
Free money
Short squeeze
No. You actually buy more PLTR and then buy some GME
Yes
Hoping for BABA next. Bullish on Chyna means you hate 'murica!
But !
Holding for now
HOLD 
No ones selling, were riding the wave until we get those tendies
We're only 30 minutes in, but I'm starting to agree. My $29C 12/4 is looking pretty dicey 
me too then promptly got back in and it's almost all gone now haha
crying
Because it is tapped out. Move on.
I sold at the high Friday morning, feeling like I noped out of a crashing plane with a parachute kek
Just bought the dip
It recovered to $30 n now it pulls this shit on the same day? Fuck Man U really cant be trusting these bitches
Just like every other meme stock, PLTR is over.
Seriously though
It was screwed no matter what, never rely on this sub
Cyber monday sale is over
It already crashed what more do you want?
Bruh what sort of brain damage is required to unironically make this post rn
Its expected it was sitting right at support, shit has been tanking for a little bit
The batteries to that big ass red dildo
Cannabis sucks lmao
Yup Ive got everything in Cura Trul Green Thumb and Cresco
depends on when they expire lol
Ride that tip at least 12/3
You really gonna burn a day trade and money in one swoop?
Will be worth $0.8 Friday evening. Will swing up a bit before that though. We ride next week.
Hold!!
Definitely hold.
Hold, its going up
weeklies with 200% iv are insane dude
Its 1.90 now
Sell faster than daphnes panties
APPle was ripe for a breakout
ACB is buy the rumor. Come Wed its back to hitting the dirty as it passes the house and fails the senate. If you're not in it now, theres little point.
I'm optimistic that this run up is a little more stable than the early november one since it bounced back sooner than others despite a market down day. Plus it came down from 12.50 but spent a lot of time retesting 12.00.

Could be in for a rug pull though, lol. I think the trading day before the House votes will be the most telling of what to expect.
The janitor that cleans my dental office always talks about that stock so you know its bad
ACB is a shit company with absolutely terrible management that hasnt been able to turn a profit over the entirety of it's existence.
crsr calls
VXRT
AAPL $125c 12/4 is pretty risky.
PFE calls on Friday eod for their fda approval

this is the dip
You're stupid for even asking. $TSLA is about to blow.
 Could HAVE*. Could of Is grammatically incoherent
Actually its a bear trap setup for tommorow when everything moons
Always was...
BS. all the coders have left SF
Dont come here with this baby shit 

ban
Palantir is based in Denver dumbass
Your friend is a dick for telling you that.
"coder" not engineer or dev but "coder" ok...
Does your friend also still live with his parents? Sorry, but I hate trash lies
I have a friend who has a cousin who has an uncle who is gay who has a friend whos third aunt twice removed has a step nephew who works for Pltr who can confirm this
and his girlfriend is a super model, that lives in Canada.
If I told you my friend fucked the girl from Cakefarts...
I would listen and buy more. 
Big if true
Sell puts
Sell calls
This sub is doing exactly what Citron is doing
Actually no, Id like to continue holding and push 35+. Good try tho
stocks only go up
Yes
We are sure to find out.  Nobody REALLY knows except a select few
How dare you

$30c 12/4
hey retard, it's up 400% since it was a SPAC. this is the literal top. only retards buy the top.
Yes all this stuff we knew about last week will crash the stock this week 
It's already pulled back bigly. All this news is priced in. Easy tear back through 300 when people realise this is minor news and the company is a behemoth.
Buddy, you might want to sit down for this.
Oh man.
Legendary down the toilet trade
If you're telling the truth then your gains are as real as their products.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Literally one bad afternoon after countless straight up days and these retards move on lmao.
Lol if it drops back to 18
I do love RKT and am a long term fan but man, gotta get out during the highs. 

I buy long dated calls and shares, sell poor mana cc during run up then cash out before EC. Has made me good money. 

Sell cc to lower your cost basis. I think my shares I got down to $13 before selling.
for now
loool, it's only been a couple of days.
It will run down for the next couple of days but long term nothing has changed. I still think $50+ by Febuary
Imagine betting against a big data company with govt contracts 

Are you dumb?
Someone mad they didnt get a slice 
Lol you were the one who has been nonstop on reddit all last night and this morning. Puts on your job
Everything is down. Now just PLTR, shut the fuck up. lol
lmao
Yeah im out too bruther, these paper hands were getting too many paper cuts
So glad I got out for a $40 profit. Would be -$700 right now.
Frog Flap
try in 10 minutes lol
Crashing soon lol
$35 
No
240 ? Am I reading that correctly?
It's one guy spamming about the rumor and he has puts
what rumor?  It's just a bunch of people coming up with stupid shit.
Selling ptlr today is proof enough of no balls
One possibility is that the jobs arent available close to where someone unemployed lives. If you are going to have to spend $10 in gas to get to a job that pays $10/hr its a pretty shit deal
because a lot of people have been laid off and don't want to go work jobs that are well below their pay grade and also some people are still taking covid precautions seriously. maybe they have health compromised people they live with.
In Canada, government is paying everyone (no proof needed) $2000/month. 

This is about the same as full time minimum wage so obviously nobody wants to go back to their shitty minimum wage job when they could sit on the couch and smoke weed and collect the same pay cheque. 

I imagine its the same for you
a physict scientist isnt gonna jump on a burger flippin job just cause they got laid off

and neither is the burger flipping company going to hire temps to train and have to walk off after a couple of months
I dont see help wanted signs anywhere and you are talking about maybe one part time job whereas there are millions unemployed.
Because when you have thousands of dollars of debt, you literally can't afford to work for minimum wage. You have to find a job to support your situation. 

That being said, Americans clearly live beyond their means. All part of the system.
Yes.
650 yolo
If you have to buy, do both sides.
U noob... they are deciding if they wanna buy tesla all at once or over a few days. Either way ita going into sp500
Hoping it helps my SPY FD calls.
You know they're deciding whether they will buy all at once or in split sessions, right?
No..... its not... don't play shit you don't understand.
It is up 7%
We're not buying the dip hard enough
Looks like it
Because profit taking and paper hands.
because it's a shitty company barely hanging on with console release revenue
You clearly have not read any posts
Except enormous name recognition, storage and distribution facilities, etc.
Stonks only go up
P&d or short squeeze
Classic
People don't understand taking a position doesn't mean literally 100% of your portfolio in one strike and date.
Shut up bitch people who actually have balls unlike yourself are leveraged 1000% here
Yes
Yes
These mfs have the softest hands
DOWNVOTED!
No shoes no shirt no problem

U a fool if you think this is all because Citron called it a "casino"


Every meme stock is dying today, and there's a reason for that.
Why didnt they have a 4000% day like that random guy in here said they would 
You thought it was going to run to $500 today?  It is up fucking 9% you dumbass.
Its not, calm down

If youre a GME loser you - by definition are either a bear or have only been holding less than  1 day! 
Still up

My pho place used to open till 12AM now they close at 7:30PM. I cant even get a bowl of warm noodles for a midnight snack anymore 
Same but might sell just to buy more GME
Same baby
Sell and lock in brofits. Buy back in when it drops to $13
Which one is this
My 1/15 30cs are printing.
date & strike price good sir
If youre bag holding like me on some of them, months
The only one I've done is UTZ, and got in at $13, still holding months later at $20.
That premarket volume. If I wasn't already holding some this would be a textbook case of at least getting in and out for a percent or two rise right at the opening bell

I'm selling this pos at open. It might recover but I honestly rather have my money elsewhere
In 2 days
Why, Chinese ev seems to be staying flat
Yeah buddy ride that shit into the ground
Nah delisted from nasdaq imo. Lol
2$ is their fair value if I remember correctly
the bottom is 16.5 bro get in while you can
Might as well. It won't fill.
No ride that wave to $10
Open or close? Either way you might get filled. Vol is higher at open and bid ask on options can get a little crazy
they're selling a lot of playstations and xbox consoles, primarily in super profitable bundles and the new console launches are driving a lot of traffic to the store. If they use their name and assets to transition to a digital marketplace as well instead of primarily in store sales, there's a route for lots of growth for them.
Its a cliff now
I do, it's called a blow-off top
Did you buy it at $51?
Ive been using the dip on CRSR for the past week. Its hurting me BIGLY.
CRSR is good for long holders, I got TP hands thats why I got out
Balls deep in $50 calls :(
Its scaring me, why it not moon..
 
Virgin bear alert
I own mgni. What's your outlook?
Same boat, other stocks keeping me afloat but BABA just barely put me in the negative.

For gme ofc
Hahhaa nice

no paper doesnt count
Builds character

yes
No paper hands here
Bull season
Rkt is safe money on long but dont buy weeklies or montlies on this piece of shit stock
About time. It's been stuck at 85 for what seemed liked a month
Alpha move by Elon bullish imo
U do know what sub ur in right?
Translation plis
yeah, GME is just legitimately good for non squeeze reason
It's over.   Look at the last two daily candles.   Huge wicks.
Look what happend with Nio after the dump and you got your answer.
ikr, literally just about to say this
Maybe for next December
Short term seems absolutely fucked for CRSR
Been holding this shit hasn't moved man
can't believe i sold that shitt around 3.4 STUPID
Weed  not doing shit for me man
Only thing Ive got in the green.
Yup so caught up about it , its over that run up is gone

Wait for it to cool down and load up on next leg up
Much of the market is down today
TSLA can sell in China now. They are doomed
What strike
What price?? u thetagang?
what was the strike?
Yessss
Valt wel mee toch
Let go, keep your winnings
Keep holding - all SPACs are slipping today cuz everything is red
Same man, I got March calls but hope it turns around like the other stocks that got shorted by citron 
Sold along the way but want those 40C to print by January.
How is that reversing
I bought SQQQ, although a few days prior to Friday.
Imagine if you could turn robux to roblox shares
When is IPO
Here
Just bought more again now, too cheap not to :)
Spy not even down 2 percent lmao
Nah shit will go back up
I sold my Tesla calls end of last week cause of how volatile weds morning was. If any stock can make it back up tho, youre holding it.
Wake up, then have to pawn your bed to keep calls open.
I posted a comment earlier about not FOMO-ing past 19. The big guy who had a ton of options did not buy past 19 and I would bet my left nut that he closed all his positions at the top.
Citron caused this.
U feel retarded yet?
a little pissed off I didn't sell some stupidly ITM calls before they were somewhat less stupidly ITM, but otherwise still green overall. so, can't complain.

how about you?
Sad!
I wrote a put today lol
Yea, i agree. But i still stupidly bought in. I think this is a trap though. I'm retarded.
this
Probably
Yep
Yep
A little bit maybe - likely going to rebound by tomorrow unless something like no stimulus or a large uptick in deaths might spook the market but doubtful.  Need a vaccine timeline goof
12/3 is this a joke?
Life hack: pop some benadryl and OD, get send to hospital and wake up the next day for market open   
it's a TSLA shape recovery
technically it is right now.. You may have dow tracking indexes buying their shares on a down day.
694.20 EOM
Gaps dont happen intraday bruv, that's just normal movement
I bought that call too. when do you plan on selling?
Sold to open some 25P on PLTR when it was 24$, that sweet sweet theta play and Im ok if Im assigned
I bought that call way too early this morning for roughly $2.24 a pop 
Casual $25k
Hell yea, bought the dip
what lesson is that
There was a potential terrorist attack in d.c. a few years ago on a Friday that resulted in a sharp sell off and soon as they found out it was just a crazy white guy, it rebounded within 30 min.  That didn't trigger a circuit breaker.  Won't see another one for 10 years maybe.
Yea
You're a 
Buy every dip
Strike price plese
patience
I dont think were at the bottom of the dip. I sold mine around $16.  SPACs will be hit this week
Im in now, lol almost typoed in for 36k instead of 6k, not that I did not want 36k worth, am happy with 6k worth
F
I love sonos the company, except they are bricking my old Play 5..
Did you mean pump?
Because it either dilutes their shares or they pay 25-30 billion of their reserve cash
PLTR mooning
TSLA.
Amd
Yes, this is how people here make money.
Probably not
The drop in the whole market no but the drop in PLTR and GME is probably exacerbated by it
Hahahahaha oh nowwwwww anyone at CNBC cares about valuations

TSLA always goes up your chilling
Welcome to free money gang!
Yes - why would it go any other way?  TSLA might even dilute their shares further for SP inclusion.
Yes
Needs a good ER run up, I'll rather not hold after ER tbh.
Boy you sure do sound like an idiot with this comment
It better
index decision already made, what is this chatter about, one buy or two?
Anyway that announcement could cause a dip?
don't settle for less. I want 19 or bust

Not speaking for all of us but thats not when we were buying calls

Uh? stop eating paint. 

They are deciding if its going to be rolled into 2 separate days of inclusion. Not just 1 big fucking day.
Nice! How much did you buy those calls for?
have you seen their cars??? Americans will go back to horses before riding that awful looking thing...
Uh 11/24????

It's been accumulated by funds, meaning they buy and sell either side of the ask and it holds the price in place, but they are accumulating shares, why, because there is upside on the stock ;)

Lol if you want to throw your money away, go for it. Puts are how you lose money. Dont fight the trend. Dont fight the Fed. Buy the fucking dip

I dont think it matters at this point, people are piling on because big name investors (aka Buffet) have recently bought lots of shares.

Yes buy GME instead
It only goes up
Not at all it has plenty of room to run
Dont think you will see that. And is there that big a difference between 600 and 590?

Don't tell him
They do pre and post market, from 9am to 6pm, options only during regular hours. Other brokers will let you do earlier and later depending on the ticker I think. Pretty sure WeBull trades as early as 4am.
keep PLTR buy gme
As they should asshole
Yes what??
APHA
wait till it hits 17, then buy buy buy
Buy small shares and see what you make of it after December pass.
Why not? Its not about fundamentals, its about having shares when the short squeeze happens
BBY making me bleed too
Jokes on you, I did last week
You can be up on GME puts or calls today depending when you bought them in the last hour lol so?
Still buying it
nah, GME still a good play, may not print like normal WSB pump'n'dump, but the company is turning around and should make you a bit if it's in shares, unless the squeeze is triggered, then we moonin.
Cause u touch yourself

bought $27 12/4 puts this morning, now hitting 67%-70% up, probably sell them in an hour or so for 150% unless it still looks like it's tanking hard by then  


I'll buy back in probably around $17-$20 by eow imo
Ah dammit.  I almost bought puts after my quick profit on calls this morning, but I second-guessed myself.  Oh well.
shes coming back
a short squeeze is a totally real thing just do your own research
Because everyone is programmed to buy the dip.
They even beating the shit out of GME
If you donate to charity you at least have some say of where your money goes.
Dont make any gains....
Before the end of the year, yolo enough money where if you were to lose it all, you'd be down 3k. If it works out yoy make alot of money to end the year. If it doesn't. You have tax deductions. 

Let me know how this works for you so I can try it next year
Mortgage interest is deductible.
More YOLO  = less gains = less taxes. Youre welcome.

Looks like rising V to me.
For every sell signal, theres some cock who sees a buy signal.
go to the 15 min chart its actually falling wedge

Lol its down like 50 cents. Thats a dump?

There is going to be a lot of volatility in the stock up until 12/20 (S&P inclusion)

Wtf are you talking about
Dead cat bounce means it will not continue it's moon mission. Which it will.
My mindset on last Friday was that big money would come in and dump to force out the paper hands, buy dips that they want and then kick off another rally.

I sold $80k of stock around $102.
Imagine saying that now, after calls already peaked. Like water is wet.
source ? did they announce if officially ? i just read that it was unlikely
Tell that to panic sellers
Fuck yeah baby
It's funny, but there's no way that happens.  This is only clarifying the how. 
Relax TSLA gang...all good.
The bull assraping that would occur... yikes
Nobody knows
It's gonna dip
Im caught holding so Id appreciate you buying calls
Michael burry said to short it
I was laughing but then I realized that I dont have enough without withdrawing 
Where were you when I fomoed and went balls deep?

Fuck off people like youre the reason its going down
Same
No diamond hand?...
Same. I had 12/18 35c and 1/15 40. Holding the 1/15, shoulda never bought calls expiring in 2 weeks 
Would LOVE another buying opportunity at 16-17
Fuck your mother
Hurr durr, must mean it's worth infinity
You do realize that pltr in its 17 years of existence has never made a profit right? Or we dropped the bar so low that we dont care about profit anymore, just guaranteed contracts and hype? If the cofounder is a celebrity/paypal mafia, then go yolo and dont look back lol
Chill out gay bear

Don't exercise the option unless you have the dough to buy 100 shares. You can just sell the option, leaving you with just the profit from the option
You need to have the 20k in your account and you'll get the shares. If you dont have that much, you can always just sell the option though and make your profits that way
If you plan to sell the shares immediately, then there is no point in exercisingjust sell the option and its value at that point will reflect the profit you would make if you did exercise and sell immediately, plus it might have a little more time value added on too.
Exercise youll need the capital for the shares in your account if you plan on selling before expiration you do not need the 20,000 hope that helps!
I think some brokers might do all that stuff behind the scenes for a fee. Best to go to r/options for better answers
If u exercise a a stock at $25, ur gonna need $2500 in ur account to buy those 100 shares. Nobody exercises options (or rarely do), just fuckin sell the call when it makes u money
You dont need to exercise. Just sell the option
Yes you do. You need the 20k. Why not just sell the contract back its the same thing.


You you just get the profit when you sell.
You can sell the option at the current mark without exercising. Nobody here exercises. If you want to exercise and sell for some reason, call your broker.
You have $1000 and you buy a contract for $500. You now have $500. If the price of the underlying stock goes from $20 to $25, the value of your call contract will directly go up as well e.g. to $1000. You can just sell the contract away for a profit. If you wish to exercise the contract, you will need the $ to buy 100 stocks (25 x 100). Whatever u wish to do with the stock after is up to you.
Great thank you all, didn't realize you could basically do either, exercise or just sell the option.
No, you just sell the contract itself because it has value. You're selling that value. No need to exercise or have that money. RH will automatically sell an ITM contract 15 minutes before expiry if you don't have the funds to buy the stock
just sell the calls for a profit and let someone else (usually MMs) do the buying/selling of the underlying shares
No one here exercises options 

We all make money or lose money with options and the rise/fall they take during the time to expiry

However, to answer your question, yes, you would need the money to buy the options. Some brokers just do it automatically and, if you don't have enough, sell it automatically and credit your account the difference. 

You're MUCH better off just selling the option up 1500% rather than exercising it unless you really want in on whatever ticker.
Most platforms you wont need the capital. Youll lose a little off the top. Realistically you would sell the option back to the market and your profit from exercising would be built into the premium youd sell it for.
Hard to take trading advice from financiallyruined

I think so too but whats your reasoning?

Yes *you* sold the option for GME.

WSB didn't do that.

PLTR is jumping ship to GME 
Don't think it's finished it's dip yet... will probs buy back in once it shows signs of reversing
would anyone be left
did you have Puts on PLTR?
Very true I agree it was highly likely to correct hard short term. But there seems to be an unusual amount of interest in it both traders and institutional. Based on the uniqueness of their products and the enormous potential for them, I personally see it being a major player up with the FBs and AMZNs of the world in 10 yr or less maybe. So regardless of my short term position I'll have 800 or 1000 shares for the long term.
Just let them die.

For the price you get an awesome car.
Didnt read but, K
I literally dont care. As far as Im concerned the companys entire value is Elons ability to hype and sell new shares. I used to think Elon was a PoS, which he is a delusional narcissist sometimes, but who cares, he can sell shares like nobody else. 

Is Tesla worth over $1M per car sold annually? Lmao. 

Im a software engineer and the car industrys hyping of self-driving cars is a lot of vaporware. There is absolutely no possibility that any government is going to allow a car to be driven on a public road without a driver at the wheel, within the next 20-30 years, likely 40-50 years. No software company will take that liability. 

The thing is though, Elon can sell shares. So the stock is dip proof.

Close up shop, Nio went like 3% red. Pack it up boys
Yeah gme
Ticker?
[deleted]
Nndm, Sft heard  few rumors.
its what im doing
Unlikely to pass. Zero relevance to BABA which has been listed forever and already complies with the proposed legislation.

People forget BABA was one of the original NYSE listed Chinese stocks, back when people were much more suspicious of Chinese companies in general (if you can believe that).
They had to use US auditing standards in order to have a chance at IPO success, especially as their IPO price was high compared to what AMZN listed at.
I dont see why baba wouldnt comply with an international audit within 3 years
Gme
CRSR has lost 33% in three days
Because theyre gay and proud
Because it is retail and earnings were terrible.
downvoted for selling like a paper handed gay bear.
We need the update
Dont think so, went 6x since April.
Relax, everything is down
China sees the EV market as a chance for them to be technologically relevant on the world stage. Plus, with the Robotaxi industry on the horizon... China wont back off to one man. Elon is up against all them crazy mfs
I've got Jan 2022 NIO LEAPS. Just take a day off from the market and don't look. XPEV and LI have had no time to consolidate at any stock level. Leveling off now gives them some foundation and the ability to move away from just meme stock status. The price targets for the next 12 months are all still quite higher than what they're at right now.   


There's still room to grow. Just chill and take some deep breaths. You'll be alright.
Id say so. Tesla shot you 50% in 2 weeks. I dont see it going much higher for a while
This is why I dont listen to random TA
It's probably due to the high traffic they get every morning that hinders options and calls trading
Wdym it didnt credit you? If you sold those options shouldnt that money be in your acct?
I want but scared itll drop
Mitch doesnt care
would this be a good thing? If youre short PLTR calls youre living the life right now.
F
looks like it
Just nabbed some $MJ leaps, so probably not
bro it's up .40 lol
Cant believe Ive been meaning to buy in for weeks buy t had money elsewhere... missed the 40% gains...
Sell. That shit is going to expire within a couple of weeks. Roll over to longer term calls if you are still bullish, don't get fucked by theta gang
NKLAs new symbol gonna be FUKD
My understanding is that theyll only be supplying battery/fuel cell tech. So they wont be bonafide partners, however GM is interested in what they have for future product development. Its definitely a step down from what a lot of investors wanted out of their initial agreement.
Hope you are correct on that.....my 12/18 40c has me gaped ATM
Hold
DEad
Cathie knowing somehow that Slack wasn't a decroded piece of shit, and me holding my ARKW calls, makes me want to just go all in on whatever she says. She's the new "oracle".
Probably not. I imagine the price goes up due to next gen console releases and black friday
nobody knows tbh, i shouldve bought ~$13 but there goes that
teach me sensei

how do I buy turbo warrants
MS upgraded it's price target due to high than expected demand for 5G iPhone in US and China. I picked up some December 31 $125c that were on sale

GRWG just had two weeks of hitting ATH's pretty much every day. No surprise it corrects. I've added more shares.

Shit blasted last week
I dont understand at all unless big money is trying to shake out weak hands before all of the cucked boomer indexes have to buy even more Tesla at $700 per share.
Nikola not Nio
Ur 2 weeks late retard
For free or do you gotta pay for the bj?
How NKLA stays over $20 baffles me

CRSR for sure
Same. Guess we diamond handing now

You don't even have to wait until it spikes, IV is so fucking high right now the value will bleed every day that PLTR doesn't jump 10%

What date contracts would you sell?
KEEP HOLDING PLTR QUEER
Ok so buy when its at $15?
Ive got 600 610 and 615. So yeah kinda fucked.
Markets been open for an hour this week lmao.
Just buy shares on the dip and buy 3+ month out calls and get rich! Don't do weeklies or monthlies bc IV crush will happen next week after earnings most likely.
Cyber Monday

Being an Eagles fan you should be used to disappointment

I hope your puts lost a lot

not sure but Fidelity lets you use cash to make trades even with PDT restriction.
We're an idea at this point
it's down 16%

Stripe doesn't need PSTH.
HAHAHA not today
Yes. Go with lord Bill Spackman
1/15/2021 250C am i going to be ok ?
Are you buying PSTH on RH? I am confused about the how warrant situation with PSTH.
SLV is so october
Probably back up to $270 I would imagine. If they didn't drill harder this morning than there isn't much selling pressure around $265
flat as usual
240 or 275. Take your pick. Hah.
BABA is fucked
Probably trade between 252 and 280 for the rest of eternity
Why is it tanking again F
Because 5 people are trading it?
Not enough movement for you in 2 hours?
You watch your mouth. We dont talk bad about TSLA here.
AMD breaking out of the 80s IMO.

Going to test higher than $90 and probably get stuck around 90. Steady fucking uptrend the past 2 weeks just grinding higher and higher.

Today was a really good bull volume day. I think we will see higher prices before a major pullback as long as the market doesn't shit it's pants again

And high short interest which means it will squeeze at some point IMO
Buy at $20 or below
Shares? Nah, buy more. Contracts? Maybe
I don't need Etrade to work to know my position is bent over doggystyle while the market fucks me.
I'm going to laugh at you tomorrow.

lol fuck the 45 call I sold sure hopes not
No one is buying calls.  What gives?
I don't think that there's a definite date yet, but expect them some time this week?
Should be the first week Id December. So this week
For you, never
AAPL about to awaken like Mariah Carey in December
lookin like puts
APHA
265
AMD reliably trades in the 78-88 range. Ideal theta gang
PLTR has done me well. RMG / QS / AMD / FSK
If it goes up a little but not higher than your calls, you'll make no money. Holding stock you would make a little. My bet is that this middle ground will be very common.
Sure I'll do the DD for you.

Bro you're asking a bunch of retards ... dumb it down a bit
Positions?
Dont be a pussy, Hold . 40 EOD
This actually is the way
Breakout was due, 4month consolidation between 75 and 85
It was entering an ascending triangle on the chart. It was getting tighter and tighter, a pop in price seemed quite likely. Glad its happening. Hoping to see $100 very soon.
motherfucker...sold my $85 calls for January at 80% thinking it will tank in that weird fucking cycle. FUUUUCCCKKK..meh...NIO.XPEV are my sand paper dildo now
Even shorts have to cover sometime. If anyone is outright buying NKLA for long exposure, well they deserve to lose their money.
And in one week it will drop to 36 so you can buy again cheap
This confirms my priors, thanks!
hype fell off

Will destroy earnings but will trade flat/sell off because they're going to overpay for WORK

Happy with my WORK shares that'll be converted to half CRM and half cash.
AP-XT
GME shares
what does this mean for a superior red blooded chad American?
what strike? I just looked at the volume for calls and it was shit
Why is that company trading at 340x sales? are they going to grow sales exponentially?
Weekly and to 2021! This thing will burn to the ground... im on the 10 strike
Id say lat december/early january. Strike wise, try to stay above 12 because some companies are still in a stock freeze up until april and that may stop the stock from completely crashing. Id say something like 15p 12/31
I threw about $500 into NCL and CCL back when they were at about $12 so all is good.
They are up huge for the month, though.  

Guessing there is a bit of rebalancing going on for the end of the month as big players rebalance portfolios a bit.
ACB is a dumpster fire, get APHA instead
except down
Lol
I am waiting for that day 
What's the DD?
Positions?
All big jumps are followed by a fade until its an actual merger catalyst. After that, it probably wont stop until $75-100
Going to trade sideways to eternity
Cause its not 3100 you apeshit
Cause its gonna stay flat
Theres only three certainties in life. Death, taxes, and amzn staying flat until the heat death of the universe
I've been waiting for AMZN to go up for a while now, it did a bit last week and now its going back down again.
Why do bears even exist? I'm still up like 10k and today is blood red.
where did you hear that from?
Liar
Idk why it decided to take off this quarter. Played it last quarter and it just kept drilling and drilling after amazing earnings. Reports the same shit this quarter and now people are buying it. My mind is blown.
Just saved my day....fml
RMG
APHA
PLTR $40 calls.
Uncertainty until Wednesday because of the house vote on delisting
Im wondering the same
Doubt it will be green.... But I'm holding my calls. I say the vote passes, it drops a few more dollars, then news comes out Friday after close that BABA has officially agreed to terms and it moons next week. But, I'm just a barber so what the fuck do I know?
for sure
Shares? Yea. Options? Not yet
Just in some shares.  Expecting it to hit $100 and then the "holy shit, we broke 100" to carry it up to the $110 area.
Bro I was gonna buy 15c a few weeks ago when I just found the ticker... Im absolutely pissed but whatever
What are you holding?
Volume on GME is very high right now
Dont buy short dated calls jabroni
doing an ACAT with options is fucking annoying because they're locked when you made need to exit 

just use a big boy broker and pay. Keep RH for trading shit like SPY/QQQ where it's super liquid IMO.
bLaCk FrIDaY wAsN't A dEaL
Why not
in with 200 shares. Lets go!
It's easier if you just call them... They're used to boomers
Not at all, was as easy as RH

If your account value is below a certain threshhold I don't think they even consider it - probably wanna have over a few thousand in there before requesting
delisting would be after 3 years if audit oversight isnt improved aka buy the dip
Probably the fact that 4,598 is a "Heavy" volume day for it
Hindenburg report
its not going any lower today but it probably isn't going higher either. better things to focus on imo
Fuck, I jumped out of AMD last week for PLTR
PSTH

APHA
I read that as "stfu"
Yep I picked up 39.5c and 40c for 12/24, hoping theyll spike on the news
Already bought stock to unload when it jumps
Lmao you asking us like we got a clue what's going to happen
Last day of the month.
i'm fucking amazed that it stayed above 360 with this volume
still bag holding cause I sold CSP lol
House vote on MMJ.
I don't think we're allowed to talk about them here.... But it's a merger rumor.
Purchased some leaps $1 July 2021-- should keep going up
Wanted to buy some options last week but the spread sucks.
Why do you say so?
100
I mean in a way its their fault isnt it
If there is any potential for vaccines by Q2 next year, CCL doesnt have a technical reason to crash
yeah no one's talking about that, in for some
Just buy high sell higher, you got this.  AMD!! 
It is still there. Look at QS.
Im sure you made money but L

Long shares or LEAPs in CRM. Slack is struggling against Zoom and Teams so CRM is acquiring at a decent discount, but there are tons of synergies and CRM will be able to put the tech to good use.

Im out at the moment. It may go down in the short term, but shares or leaps will be safe. If it drops below 190, buy up monthly calls. At 210, the stock is very vulnerable to FUD and bad news.

MSFT $215c & 217.5c 12/4

... no
Do whales shit long shits or small shits? Idk
No idea wanna sell soon
MSTR is a better play imo, it's a real company with significant investments.
Yeah I wrote 50 1$ calls on it
PSTH? PLTR? The answer is yes.
This is your last chance to jump ship
Ha same. Wtf?
I opened 12/31 $11p's this morning. I knew this stock was a POS before the Hindenburg hit. 

The drop of the adjusted GM "deal" is enough to crater this thing despite the (back-end) of the EV craze. I am usually a perma-bull so I am happy to jump on this one - plenty of room to fall.
No
Hard to say, I was going to buy 12/11s this morning at open, but am waiting it out now. If you're up, you could take some profits.
No, Im holding 535c 12/18 and 900c 12/31.
Ban
Bought 200 xop jan 22 calls on Wednesday, down 50k already. I think I have finally learned my lesson.
leaps in XLE?
seems like it
Turd ass MP gtfoh!  I bought some of that crap too and sold it this morning to buy NVAX.  Best decision this week.
Stock or calls? I was going to buy today :(
That's what I was wondering... It saved my ass today though
How do you not sell after that insane run
Ive 50c exp 12/18 am i fucked?
My life is in Corsair. I hope the 50c 1/15/21 I picked up today pays.
First time seeing a billion volume lol
Large funds such as ARKK buying in along with WSB call purchasers are what drove the price action last week. Now most of the WSB memers have jumped ship, the share holders are staying put. Therefore you have this flat ass movement
Something something google and other cloud services do what they do for free
Vaccine news and thats about it for good catalyst what else ? Holiday season? Santa rally ? 

We are near ath why more upside tell me
Your calls wont print
Sometimes...part of it is due to the fact that Europe closes at 11AM, it's basically their power hour.
APPS goes up to 42 then crashes to 30 the runs to 42 then crashes to 30

That is how that ticker has gone for literally weeks now
When it crashes it goes even farther than where it was = better growth. Healthy pull back. Nothing wrong with that, and it usually getting to new heights.
Look at the spread its prob shit and you wont get filled
try getting it filled, prolly a dummy ask
Less interest will bring down the extrinsic value.
Hopefully it thaws and finds gravity
What do you use to look at orders?
I did and Im up
Look At the charts 
Doesnt really go down
Might just join in  Weeklies or month out?
I'm a pothead so I did
how much?
Me at .55! Sold at .76
Me
Unlimited apps at Applebee's is the play
Working for me. Do you use power etrade?
That would be selling low in my opinion. But be careful with your expiry and your price target, which I dunno, seems high to me (I'm conservative, so I could be wrong)
I bought 4/15s, they are only up 75% :/
not sure how? did you not know the lockup ends Dec 1st?

Might want to expand that DD my guy.
What's gonna make it pop?

Nikola puts. Its going nuclear
What the fuck. Never thought i would see the day ROKU was trading near 300. Wild times
I bought a couple of 400p for Friday. I think you gotta have balls of steel to be bullish. God speed to everyone regardless of how you're playing it, but my assessment is anything short of guidance saying 'oh hell yeah the business we've seen these last 6 months is sustainable for years to come' means the stock takes a dump.

I'm sure the numbers look good, but the outlook is not great. ZM is the anchor on the vaccine news dumps and there are more to come -- FDA approvals for each vaccine for emergency and general use and phases of distribution. Every one will be a kick in the nuts.
Idk if I should hold through earnings or not :o
cant beleive its lagging like this!
Because fuck China
Yes
ant ipo delayed until at least 2022
Cant imagine the news will really affect the stock either way.
Do they have a target?
Shhhh let it happen
once again proving yourself to be the biggest dickhead in this sub. time and time again
Keep holding if you want to get rid of it at 250.

thats a citron favorite lol

When in doubt, both.

It better

Iran, China, Russia, etc.
Bet it keeps running now, been pretty stagnant for a few months even with a few sucessful product launches
I bought some $130 12/4's at .02 today. Lets hit $135 so I can retire plz.
Bold
I would hold it. BABA is my bank account basically. Super safe
You dont think it will dip ?
ayeeee
what was the bid ask when you bought the calls, every time i want SQ calls there is like a .50 gap
No its extremely possible we will hit that number again. 


https://investorplace.com/2020/11/why-bears-must-not-bet-against-pltr-stock/
Dont do that
Flat
I just liquidated my Chinese stocks on NYSE.  Kept my TCEHY since its on OTC
FB bought a crm startup too.
Thats like stock market 101 bud, the acquirer goes down and the other party moons due to high premiums.
Slack deal is expensive. Sometimes these mergers hurt the parent company financially. Then the product flops either through bad management or market shifts and the parent is bag holding. 

Slack over valued itself then leaked the merger talks to bump its stock value for better negotiation position causing CRM to over pay for an already 70/30 chance of making a good deal to CRM. 

All this has investors shaken. 

Best case for CRM is its a all stock deal to purchase which for investors is not so good as your shares are getting diluted. But will leave CRM in a better financial position. 

Upside is all on WORK not CRM in the short term with this deal and possibly long term.
Calls
Im thinking puts
GME
TSLA calls
FB 300 calls for January
been in thc b for a week
Maybe, but if Bill announces the merger target by then it could be golden. Im in March 25c just to give it a little more time. They said merger announcement expected by Q1.
Its PRINTING. First winning play Ive had in weeks. Im scared of getting fucked by ZM not meeting expectations tho...you selling before close?
I'm all for that, but it's been kinda sluggish lately.
What is it?
Was worth about 30k not too long ago

Slowly no until close
I have june 2021 baba 300c... i need it 290+ to break even late january am i fucked??? fuck baba man..
Do you have enough in the acct to cover the shares if you're assigned?
You don't have sufficient margin in your account to take 100 shares so they liquidated you to prevent you from taking ownership of 100 shares if your call is in the money at the close.
M1 chips are fucking revolutionary
TSLA, ITM furthest exp the better and safer

Careful with the short squeeze fam
jokes aside, ive noticed the same.

this sub has always been comedically sorta dumb, but the sheer amount of comments that just display an absolute 0% understanding of how options work recently is concerning.

The other day I had like 10 people argue that the buying and selling of options doesn't affect the stock price, and I got downvoted into oblivion for saying they did. Lmao.

Edit: The more the market goes up and the situation normalizes the less inclined Congress will be to pass another bill and the less political capital stands behind the fed put.
Don't think so. We already got 2 effective vaccines - the future is clear, we are not left in the dark anymore. Doesn't matter that hospitals will be temporarily overwhelmed, heck, we might even get a lockdown in the US. Won't matter much as it is clear that it's just temporary.

I've been commenting for the past week that this wave was going to crash. I closed all my PLTR positions 2 Friday back after already making 100% return. The greed is unbelievable with these idiots

Had 30 of them at $2.50 per and sold at $3.24, wanted a quick score is all. That dip was way too big is all. Could have got them for $1.60 and sold for $3.50 but can't be perfect.

Lol. Its up 36% in the last year and is still a great long term play.
Probably best to long aapl as it could see some movement this year.  With GME you want to wait for the squeeze so could be a few weeks plus+.  Can't speak on PTON or NIO

Not as big as my gains but when you're long red days are a mirage. 2k shares @ 10.51 avg, would be down like what, 12k from Friday highs if I sold today. But I'm holding forever so shrug a doodle doo.
I sure hope so. But I doubt it
Yes sir

>If all the paper hands holding GME can get the fuck off now so we can actually sqeeze these hedgies, that would be great. Don't fucking buy GME if you're scared to fight for your right to party on the moon

I thought it's typically the company that's getting acquired that moons. The parent company usually drops. I could be wrong though, I'm just a retard.
high demand for buying

people taking profits before a big change

trailing stops getting triggered
paying for an unprofitable business
Stocks go down when a company purchases another. Huge investment that often doesnt work and can put the parent in a bad financial position. 

Details havent been released yet but best case scenario is its a for stock purchase. 

Heres the problem, WORK has always over valued itself. This isnt the first merger attempt. I suspect WORK leaked the merger talk news to boost the stock price as leverage. Smart move would be for CRM to walk away rather than over pay. If they do go through with this may be hard times in the near future of CRM holders.
Testing some of the rocket features....well get it figured out
Its an spac with a bottom, if youre not loading up right now you were born to be poor
There is an impending short squeeze. Look up VW short squeeze to get a sense of what is going to happen. 17.50 could look like a bargain in a few days, but if you dont time the squeeze right, you will most likely be left bag-holding at that price. There are people playing this squeeze that got in at the $6-7 range.

If I had cut and run this morning Id be down about 1400$ more than I am now
And how exactly do we know when that is
If you bought anytime aside from the last two trading days your up lol. Tired of these ominous warnings from people who buy only FDs

No shit. People are betting on a short squeeze because there are more shares shorted than are outstanding. It's a dead company long term but there is a massive upside short play at the moment.
\+10% literally flat
Michael Burry and Ryan Cohen are also betting on it. And Cohen might just take it over.

If you need your actual net worth for financial planning, then yeah you need the expected tax load. If you're just looking at the scoreboard, who cares.
I just use before (current value).  You start trying to factor in taxes, inflation, and all that other shit that will affect it in the future and you'll tie yourself up in knots.

Don't do it. Helix or a purple mattress should help. Free trial periods for peace of mind on the $ spent.
Bought a cheap ass BJs mattress works good imo
nest alexander mattress.  worked for me.
Firm spring mattress is an option.  Forget that ultra plush pillowtop crap.   The only minus is the internal padding wears out after 3-7 years so it will sink.  

Thought about a latex mattress as they can design them to your level of firmness and supposedly last longer.  But cost a ton.

A workaround temp is to find an ultra thin pillow to put under you, to try to counter the sinking, and see if that helps any.

Wait another couple of days, it went up 10% today, that's a lot for this little guy.
No
Itz for dem yuppies and city slickers.  Stick with Ford, GM and Marlboro like a real man, u hear? Keep Murica gr8 yeehaw
Is up 11%. Is that not enough for your PLTR holding ass?
Super weird day today didnt really make much sense 
Vol didnt spike at all and some big names like AAPL pumped
High as weed stonks
As a ZM call holder, I wish you the worst of luck good sir. May the best retard win.
Why? I may be down.
Ur not supposed to buy options at earnings since vol drops for that week so value of option drops
Wait so you are saying a traditional brick and mortar will struggle against online?  Mind blown.
1 hour 2 early
Ssssssh please
Where can you see this?
best of luck
Jazz is a dying genre. Its all about emo rap now

Yes
No no no. Goes to $130 first.
If they dont break 121 by eod, thats probably what will happen. Theyve been flirting with 120 for 3 months.
Not yet. I need 130
Please not till tomorrow afternoon, I can't dump with em yet
Honestly Amazon kind of temporarily capped because of the fact that they wont be able to match the numbers they made during COVID. I expect them to trade sideways for a quarter or two
Flat and then goes back to 119 tmmrw
$122 hopefully
FROG
Apex definitely
APHA
PTSH
 OR RMG (sleeper)
LULU
PTON
MSTR
Why would it move? PSTH is not a short-term move
Why would it be moving? Nothing has changed
its really strange. It's been locked at just under $26 for pretty much the whole day. I'm not sure if this is bullish or bearish
and xpev
Check riot bud
does it expire today? RTX and BA go up and down with the general market. Just wait it out.
Tomorrow before close

I used to trade EURUSD and USDJPY more actively but it just demanded too much time to monitor given the leverage in play.  With that said, I'd expect long term the dollar will decline.  Good luck if you're playing some real short time frames.
Everyone thinks dollar is fuk... but dollar is going to alpha centari
Doesn't even know the actual ticker, autist
might get lucky there buddy
In the good way
When did you buy that?
APPL 130 EOY easy. you'll wake up in tendy town just like how Dorthy woke up in The Wizard of OZ
Nothing to worry bout. Just buy calls GME 
floaters are when you eat too much fatty foods.
Oh my fucking god

Who dares wins buddeh
Or you could do something safe like buy xpeng or NIO knowing that they are on sale and will skyrocket again soon
Man I've been doing good for months not falling into meme hypes. I bought NIO but I did that back in January well before it became meme gold (still holding at 1,100% gains ). But yeah, I finally fell for one and it was PLTR at its high last week goddamnit
GME isnt even the next GME yet bro chill
CRSR better end the day positive for once in its fucking life.
I had to stop the bleeding
You will be bagholding for 20 years.
Fuck that penny stock. That shit needs to leave our solar system to help these bags.
Yes sell NIO please you deserve to FOMO and paper hands at the next top
Yea lets drop NIO, they only have a report tommorow and 2 catalysts coming up Im sure they wont moon after having a fire sale today. Fucking idiot
Drop it and buy Tesla while it dipped today
Im only holding until midday tomorrow. I have lost more than Ive ever gained with TSLA.
Hold. Announcement coming two hours after market close.
My guess is it will consolidate at 540 and then back to the moon and beyond
How much higher can it go?
$VALE 12/4 $15 calls
Doesnt have the retard strength to reach 121. Time to recharge all the way to 115 and start again.

Buy the dip...
Long term buy on any dip
what's your prediction on this? Stock price drops to 380?
COST throwing tendies at me, i am jack to the tits      
TSLA took it, it was just a helpless passenger. Fucking American EVs spoiling the fun
No when shit dips this much it goes back up
Dumb asses man. Shit company. Its just pump and dump
Theyre all banking on a mythical short squeeze
Impeccable timing
Think it's got more to do with people getting out before a potential earnings dump than the market looking at 2025
fucking lmao, someones mad
you should get involved with it instead of watching the party happen
Its a short squeeze.
It's a short squeeze

Or, hear me out, get in both because 
What about CRSR
Absolutely no one learning their lesson after PLTR.
Perfect time to reload
LMAO PLTR isnt dead
Imagine thinking PLTR was dead after one red day
stfu boomer

No.. calls need diamond hands. 90% down you wait, the most you can lose is another 10%, and the most you can gain back is 90%

This market moves so fast youll get at least 40-50% back within 2 days if not be green because its Lord Palantir
Ahahahah
What strike
Financial advice
Holy shit this is what this sub has become from its glory in February
No dont be retarded
SPY 200ps it is
Doubtful.
For once? That shit was like $24 just a few weeks ago
Earnings in a few days
Yeah, that was a short term play. Youre out or youre praying at this point
yup
Die, bear.
it wont reach 20, but i doubt it'll reach 40 eow or even eoy like that guy was saying...

Could be wrong either way of course.
Sure
No one in the world can buy or sell options premarket or after hours with any broker
no
ffs no
No

Nope
Look at the 30 day on APHA.  Literally cant go tits up.

Up 6% for the day so far is not "tanking."
Still up 6% for the day boyo chill your beans
I aint selling
Nah B
Been talking about this one for a couple weeks now lol
3% lol. Dawg, the memes and SPACs are up 10-30%
Its not all time high, thats at like 45
ATH high huh? Try changing the chart from 7D
Lol this isn't theta.  They're getting just straight destroyed by delta.

Your post reads like an 18 year old who just got into options.
Maybe someone could actually say what that means instead of acting like that helps
GME is up 7,4%.
lmao imagine hating money this much. GME up 200% past 3 months and this dude is like "I TOLD YOU YOU SHOULDN'T BUY!"
GME is still up 9% on an extremely red day. stfu
Its up 9% on the day bro haha. Some people profit take in the morning, its still way way up
Because its a dying garbage company that sells scratched copies of Big Chungus 2k18 for the Xbox.
MM are stronger than WSB
Who could have known stoners would suck at staying on top of running a company?
Lol. Its down 0.59%.
Hahaha I know, any news are good news now a days
I'll cream my pants
Sorry we are green, and going to 35. I have saved the comment.
Nah. We holding. You paper hands.
THIS.
I hope you realise PLTR was -4% premarket before mooning to 30 from 24 lmao
So my puts might print!?

Jan 21 28 Ps
SEL SEL SEL
GME is. Next stop, tendie town.
I think you meant to say shintel
Their new CPUs are actually really good
why?

Youre selling at 200 right?
Better wait for the squeeze before you play yourself
Not if you like money
Id bet against this shit company all day, but if you really want to go with calls, at least give the market a bit more time to panic before buying
Unless you hate money... GM deal went south
Me too so I can buy in
 
!RemindMe One Month
Why?
Youre assuming weve got profits
What is profit?

You must be new here
PLTR is in the business of going up
I'm in the military and we use it at work. Good stuff. And we overpay for everything.
they have a proprietary, *smarter* way to examine and discover connections between large and heterogeneous datasets, and to turn that into actionable intelligence.

in other words, 

BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU
I understand based on the position of the moon and mercury being in retrograde that PLTR will be 1000eod and make the money go brrrrrRrrrRRr
Look at Peter Thiels business philosophy, he invests in making monopolies and not money makers at first. What Pilantir does is sell software to govt and public entities that connects the dots. Thats laymans terms, they do a lot of shit, search the sub for stuff in between the rocket ships
Buy shares or leaps to ride out volatility
y pltr not big mone?
no we're BTFD
Great idea owning it then.
Imagine saying this while GME is up 9% with an intraday high of like 17%
But if they turn this ship around it's a 50-100% gain
People have been saying it's on the way out since XB1 and PS4 were released. There's a market for physical game stores, plus MSFT owns a huge chunk of it
Youre looking at it as a long term investor. Of course there are plenty of other picks that are much better. But the potential reward is whats so enticing. No one cares about GME in a few years from now. Its just about what will it do in a few months
This shit is going 30 soon
How many times do we have to tell you autists that this is a dec 3rd and onwards play
All the pump and dumpers have been getting banned. Hopefully youre among them
I sold this morning after being disappointed yet again.
P&D baby lets get it
It opened way higher than the price you probably locked in during AH
Your price is too low given that the stocks are rising. Hence the buying price went high. It wont be filled
The limit price changes as the price does. No one wants to fill your orders with an old price that they could get for more money now. Replace the order.
Because your limit purchase price is too low and no one wants to sell it to you for that amount.
There is your problem. Robinhood lol
Im switching to fidelity next tax year
Relax pussy it will print

I'm holding my 29c so I'd advise yes
If you're that scared over a single call that's down 17%, you need to stop playing options and head over to r/investing
yes
Im down 33% on a 12/4 28c and Im holding. Cant paper hands it.
Intel is being outpaced by AMD
Intel has a shit-tier CEO right now that's selling off assets instead of using them to put the company back on top.

They're going to be undervalued for years.
Thats like buying Ford instead of Tesla.

Looks better than it could tbh
Bears not letting it moon
if you rode through the last few hours, you'll feel pretty good with PLTR right now!
What??? How? If you bought the dip at $25 you eating.. calm that ass
I timed the bottom and currently have $700 from one trade, and waiting on exit for the second to figure out the profit.

Whats your position on Hexo?
same thing with me last week missed out on 10 contracts but with 24 c
Bid ask spread son.
Was it a market order or did you try to buy it at Fridays prices? Theyre up 300+% now so you wouldnt get it at the cheaper price
Your bid price probably too low, no one selling at the price you put in
If you dont know what that means its probably for the best you arent trading options lol
Lol you definitely put in a price ask that's waaay too low for what it is now. Press on your order and replace it and see what the new bid is.
Since GME went up in price pre-market the option you tried to buy also went up in price. So the bid you placed during the weekend is now too low to execute.
Dow off 265 points you know its coming
AS WE SPEAK BABY!!!

Just look at market cap...
They cant.. this is just a short squeeze. Theyll go bankrupt eventually
GameStop the company has very little to do with GME the stock and its performance at this moment in time.
Never never going to. This is the meme of all memes. Microsoft and Sony are making huge plays to go all digital. This gen may be the last generation of physical consoles as they want to do cloud gaming only. 

Before long there will be almost nothing to sell from a brick and mortar store.
By squeezing the fuck out of shorts.
Riddle me this riddler: How are the shorts going to cover their positions?
Don't lie you actually bought puts and lost it all didnt you
Yeah 10am eastern time real lunch time hours for those new yorkers
It's not lunch yet
It's barely even brunch time dude
no
Hold please
No
Nah
Yes, it was imminent.
Doubt
Bet u paper hand like a lil bitch  
Real ones are holding
I didnt, holding 220 shares but I sold my calls for 12/4 at the high this morning
I missed that bus .. shits expensive now
sell a call one strike above
No. Because if it crashes you lose your gains and now owe the buyer all that money from the put. How does that make any sense? You sell a call
CCL might as well be a fucking meme stock
TSLA & Safe dont go in the same sentence.


Ban.
600c weeklies 
They just ran up 50% in two weeks, it's a high volatility moment for them, not a safe option right now

Hopefully tmrw or the day after rally FINALLY resumes. Then its time to fomo into Xpeng.
Must have been late to the party
Lol what. It's up 1200% this year, what's the angle?
Put big bets on LOW and TGT for their earnings. Thankfully my weight on TGT was heavier and they took off pretty well to profit even beyond the cost of LOW.

LOW earnings were that typical 'good not great, COVID costs high and things aren't changing next quarter' into a stock tank.

Think both LOW and HD ot beat up more than they should have. Still have Friday to salvage my LOW calls but I don't think a 10% move is in them.
dont be bitch
BTFD
How far out are they? If April then easy hold
Dude now IS the time to start looking at puts
Please don't start buying calls
Lmao whatever you want to believe, most sectors are down today smooth brain

Not yet. Please
Get out soon. Great pop today.

earnings call is next Tuesday after hours, should be green, if we buy and hold till after that, we good

Seek help or chuck them before its too late. Its way easier now than it will be in a week.
Just stop now.

Been there done that, lost a lot of friends, get out now bro
If youre only a couple days in you are in a great position to stop now. If you give it any more time youll end up super fucked
I've been far down that road. I hope you get the help you need because it's a dark, lonely place to find yourself.

fuck no!! I haven't bought in
Well all be out of it by then homie.
No one gives a shit about long term for gme, everyone is just hoping for a massive short squeeze
yeah but not in the next 3 weeks, its going to the mOoN
Whats your position? Nothing?
You are getting downvoted but it might happen lol
30 mins into market open... lol
Once we arrived on the moon and our journey back to earth begins
After the squeeze
Maybe tomorrow for me
Hey buddy that's me!  On the plus side I actually sold a 7 bagger last week so all the money I've spent on it today has been from that.

What's the rumour?
How did I not hear about this, what is it?
That rumor is insane. Can't believe they actually revealed some of it.
no, PLTR has retard strength. We're going to test $30 again this week.
Earnings call is going to hurt it so bad
When are they gonna add the damn shares????? 11.2 Mil.
More like GME 
You really think Tesla is the first company to exploit accounting tricks? Gtfo
So, this is what it is like to be standing on the launchpad under the rocket huh?

Lol
you're crazy we have like 100% to go
Its still up 7% smfh
same here :/
That thesis ignores the huge wave of BOM passive inflows
I sold 100 12/18 15s and 50 12/4 14s.

That's about 20K in premium, and if I get assigned I'll sell calls into that high IV as well.  Never mind the squeeze opportunities and shareholder activism.  

This stock is going to be fun over the next few monts.

True. SPY is only up 11% in the almost month since Biden was announced the winner.
You down?
Holy shit have you been in a cave for the last 2 months?
>  that place is dead as fuk
It only appears dead AF, people have been doing good DD and showing that it's actually in the green again and Rising, they're pivoting to ecommerce and succeeding. People are trying to trigger a short squeeze, cause if there were ever a time WSB could trigger one, it'd be GME.
Short squeeze
Squeeze or something idk I just like money
flat actually. spiraling would be below 25 by now
Thank the lord
Yes. Speculation of ww3. First Iranian nuclear head taken out, now a German dog wounds president elect

I think they see a rise but it's worth noting their earnings were great last time and they got absolutely slaughtered post-earnings.
What happens at 3?
why?
Its going down BIGLY.  Buy puts, my dad owns Tesla
random dude on Twitter with 300 followers... I'd say no.
Probably a sell the news event but who knows really
last time the coin was this high Riot was over $25
Okay dude I get it. You had a GME position, got tired of waiting for the short squeeze, sold for a loss and are now pissed and out to revenge trade. There's no saltier bear on a stock than a former bull :)
See you on the other side
Risky move w the consensus being that they murdered earnings
IV
IV is contracting a lot
You gotta learn the Greeks.

Check your Delta, Gamma, and Theta.  Your delta is how much you can expect the value to change with a $1 move in your favor.  Gamma is the increase to Delta on the next $1 move.  Theta is how much value you lose holding for 1 more trading day.

Basically you need it to keep moving down, and the closer you get to being in the money, the more you'll see your value affected by minor changes in stock price
Good thing you learned about IV after putting your money at risk huh?
Yes go for it
This is good because tomorrow it is up big

Meanwhile I cashed out half my calls today at 250% and the rest are still up 230%. Enjoy sitting on the sidelines.
Huh? Its up 6% ?
Hi citron

GME; "up 9% today while market is down"  
This  fucking guy : "dEd StOcK"
We have the power of Burry behind us
Unless you have the attention span of a goldfish, nothing really changed. It's simple math, prices have to rise if the shorts cover and they did rise. But the short interest is still high, so unless that changes there is room to run.
Haha Im 30 and ugly
49 and gay, prepare your anus.
Fading??? It's up 10% premarket
Lol when you see a candle that big its not because its going down, its because there was 91,000 shares traded that candle

other 1m candles have 500-2000 shares traded per minute for reference. 

someone just bought every share they could find in a single minute.

woah.
Its not about life expectancy or death rate of covid. Its not a binary life versus death. Its highly contagious and  People do fall sick. Hospitals get overwhelmed and we get fewer beds and ventilators. Also, we get out healthcare staff sick and then they have to stay home and then emergency rooms get even more crowded due to understaffing
Lol
Seeing GME bears gives me so much joy, just to confirm there are actually people dumb enough to short it and this is how they think

Is it worth buying in now after the initial announcement or nah
Like for real Who knows? All you can see it that the momentum is intact and its going to ath anytime
I think the dip was on Friday tbh
It has insane momentum. It took a dip friday due to a hit piece from Citron - and even then, it was only a 4% dip. Today, it's already back up 4% PM. With the momentum and big players it has behind it, it will likely not see much more of a dip this week.
Its Alibaba. They made 72b in sales in one damn day.

Literally nothing has changed, except a citron hit piece came out.
IF you got PLTR shares, EVEN at ATH, hold. This is a strong company, led by big fucking titan dick swingers, with government support that is breaking into the commercial space with a strong consulting/data analytics offering that is going to be difficult for other competitors to top.  


This company is guaranteed 100B market cap sometime in the next few years, panic selling now is stupid. If it tanks, buy more

It makes houses more expensive but borrowing cheaper. Good for any homeowners.
Because Biden isnt really where the mainstream Democratic Party stands on a consortium of issues. For better or worse, hes centrist at best on social issues and very hawkish on economic policy and upholding the post WW2 American hegemony. Fiscally hes a neoliberal who believes in markets.
Yes i will do it. Raising interest rates during a economic disaster is like the dumbest move you can make. Companies gonna get shat on if they cannot borrow cheap money during this time.

Are you trying to sell a naked call?
what dont u understand about infinite risk
Whatd you do? Short something?

If so it could technically go up infinite percent and youd lose infinite money
It means that order introduces infinite risk
It means if you open that position you are exposed to infinite risk, like selling a naked call, since theres no limit how high a stock can get you're max loss is technically infinite
Selling naked calls introduces infinite risk because if theyre exercised, youre on the hook for 100 shares at whatever the strike price may be (theoretically no upper limit)
dont trade on RH, use alternatives. I havent seen as many horror on any other platform. GET OUT OF RH NOW
Google 'infinite'
it means learn what options are before you buy or sell them you fucking. moron. Go look at the horror stories of people losing everything cause they are as dumb as you and didn't learn what they were doing.

The risk with writing a call is infinite because you are agreeing to sell 100 shares at a set price regardless of what the stock price is.
It means you can lose infinite money you stupid fuck its not a covered position where you can trade the shares you agreed to give a person basically in an options trade
Youre your mothers greatest regret
huh? It's still up 10% lol
Actually, no stock has unlimited downside you gay bear
Yeah, you woulda lost out on a fuckton of money in the past decade with that attitude.
Will do
Do it
Do it. Either you're gonna make money or I'm gonna make hellaaaaaaa money
They are the best creatures, just be prepared for them to be in the way and eat a shit load of foos. 

Calls on CHWY
You buying that story?
My least favorite dog. Theyre loyal I will give you that
Your bitch meter is raging
Green by close nerd
How about.. nah
Where are you seeing blood red lmfao, it looks like a small dip nothing more. Some of my stocks are up premarket as well
This was me on Wednesday on opening with those exact positions.
Wouldn't be glad missing the flight with PLTR      
YOU BUY MORE RETARD
about to miss out on major tendies, dont be a little bitch
found the PLTR bag holder
Shut up loser
Your the retarded who jumped on the PLTRA train became a random person on the internet told you to, ya fucking stupid and deserve to lose all that money on your 40 calls
Bad
This guys just jealous because he hasnt gotten any tendies. Bitch.
Imagine being such a braindead retard that you listen to this sub and then get mad at it because you lost money. Own up you cuck, youre a retard buying retarded plays, PLTR was up 150% and you bought calls? That's on you retard
Not our fault your account is red
Why's that
Gonna lose this game homie. Wait until over 20 before you buy puts. 

My target is 50.
I thought 9:30? Says pre-market until 9:30
Stocks not options
Yes
We dont have time to be clicking links while were losing money! Just tell us the I told you so!
Yeah, cause we should all buy into one retard shouting a ticker in the Daily without any DD
PSTH is a meme too, just less memey.. For now.
I bought some
Do you even have any cash left, you filthy ?
Sure, do you want the winning powerball numbers and the 2021 super bowl champion and score while youre at it?
No one knows, sorry
lol
Go ahead and buy the dip, retard. Let us know how it works out for you.
Theoretically yes. But i doubt they wont follow the rules to stay listed. after Wednesdays vote china still has 3 years to comply. Panic selling isn't over though.
why tf would u even say that
Dudes like this are the reason my calls are negative rn
objectively naruto is better but...

when it comes to anime I'm a boomer & DB will always be the goat IMO
Hitorijime My Hero
Both are gay
Went for 12/18 25 P myself.
Thats a shame, I hope your toilet is up for the challenge!
wtf it broke out of the 120 range
Why would y wou u think that's a good idea?
GUH.
That is gonna be.... a long dip.
Lol buy Nikola puts.
Don't do it bloodbath
The GM deal is no more. Going back to 18.
If you like bankrupting
make sure to hold your puts all the way through expiration so I can see the glorious loss porn
Puts on stocks this cheap is just fucking stupid.
Too poor, sorry
Ban this retard
Its already been decided....
#MODS BAN
You are talking about selling *shares* for a loss!? We need a Paper Hand Autist of the Year award, and I nominate you
Why sell before the call?
NO
What the fuck?
You know this isnt about inclusion right? Tesla is already in.
No
This is why you lose money
Youre a ducking dumbass. I like it. 
BAN
Get the fuck outta here!
Its 10:30 lol
True retard NIO day just before that u fucked son
Enjoy losing that money lmfaoooo
Why?
inversely down
jfc, start the paper trading competition already so ppl can learn

no
No...
Yep
lol
Did you not hear Moderna honking its fucking horn? Vaccine pump MONDAY.
Late riser? Start walking to the slaughterhouse. Were having  tonight.
LOL
Current market price. So $18. Premarket is current.
18
18
Whatever it is pre market
You get it at whatever the price is in PM and selling. But at open this is probably popping.
Depends what price you pay
Lol get out
lol no
Not even close. Not even kinda close. Not even on the horizon close.
i see uptick no?
35

it always opens at 9:30 what the fuck are you people on
35.. like every other day bro..
This is the type of person some of you retards are taking PLTR DD from. Remember that.
Ban
Markets closed today sorry.
35

Nobody tell him.
5 min till premarket opens.

&#x200B;

9-9:30 = premarket

9:30-4:00 = regular market

4:00-7 = after hours market
neither it opens in 45
That was for 2025. How crazy is that
Yeah, and pretty much everyone thought that hot chick was crazy. Now shes hot and RICH.
You pay a premium for convenience.
an object at rest tends to stay at rest, people just dont want to get out their house, also in a cold climate it is more appealing bc cold
Theta is a bitch sir
As a college student without a car, its either that or our atrocious dining hall
I see youve never been high as a 
Again it's convenience.

There are definitely some places I'll just Doordash because they're a bitch to go pick up from, across town, traffic, etc.

Otherwise yeah it's usually a waste.
I never understand people who say this. The restaurant is who is fucking you, they set the prices. I wont buy from a restaurant that wants to gouge me, fuck them.

Look at McDonalds or any local spot that decided not to boost prices...we have some good pubs around here that the price in door dash is the exact same..same is true with McDonalds and most the fast food out there. The restaurant does that....

Now there are delivery fees and taxes...I personally get dash pass for free through my credit card so I do luck out there but with the right restaurants all I am paying is tip to the driver...and the tip will be less than what I gave to waiter so it works out for me.

Also depends where you live, I live just outside town limits of a college town so I have like 100 options that can be here in less than 30 mins.
On this sub everyone jerks off, twice a day
You've gotta pump those numbers up.
Nah bruh PLTR back to $30 by tomorrow
Sadly wrong lyrics for today. :(
Hold and look back in 5-10 years time. Only way to go triple retard now would be to paperhands it and cash out early.
Whoop whoop! $29.04 here!
Brother?
Ouch
second
Hate that stuff
Early 2021 calls, close to ITM if you are a pussy, 30$ if you yolo on the squeeze.  
Add some shares if you want to contribute to triggering the squeeze. Hold till 100$/share
GME so hot right now
my 12/11 35c's hope you're right
12/4 30c
Just call in "uh yes Cramer im hearing rumblings about a potential short squeeze on game stop....yes I said game stop. What do you think of the price action going on right now"
literally, no joke, ironically; that is not how it works. there will never be boomers again and if there is its because years and years and years from now they decided to recycle the name -- for an entire generation. i dunno about you, but i'm gen z, even when i'm 99
I wanna be, forever young!
Are me you?
EOD
Let's fucking ride it
At ATH?
How much will the shares be worth?
Yeah have you? It was at 24.
I bought the dip at 25 by putting 100K in shares then panicked when it dipped at 24 and sold covered calls. Now praying it stays above 25 by friday. Super stressed

We all knew. Silly s.


this is the way
Look Is this a Wendys or not? I want a goddamn frosty pls.
NOK leaps
lets make some fuckin tendies brotha
Lmao imagine actually calling someone to place option trades and getting judged by the someone
Wait no I sold at the open at $29 my bad
Hey at least you didnt panic sell for a tremendous loss
i never said that though?
Just search GME short squeeze here and on google.
IM NOT FUCKING SELLING
There is zero logic in your comment lmao
Oh yee of little faith. I think we're good, maybe the europoors help us out over night tomorrow.
Yes I know, thats why I said right now
But it literally has been the past couple weeks

I mean I always thought could you imagine and here we are
Im new here, is it not always like this? All the calls WSB have made in November I followed and Ive gotten AT LEAST 20% on each of them with shares
teach me your ways master
as a PLTR holder, I hope it does. I want discount calls.
Ban
My body is ready
Mustve been for him to put up with that level of wyling
Nah I held my shares and sold 12/4 44cs to idiots who thought it would rise another 50% in a week
Just average down and buy more as it drops, that's what I'm doing.
I realized it with my SL. See no potential to make it back today
If everyone else is it literally can't go tits up right?

2 months ago I lost 1k on GME calls lol.
Knew I wanted to buy the option for $600 but I didnt have the cash.
Oh Im not worried... at least till Thursday
Yeah, let's do it. I'd love to save on housing expenses.
Woah, I hope you're already in
Your retardation gives me faith
People on this sub have been taking peyote  and rain dancing in circles for a GME squeeze for months lol
One half day at -2% and people are already panicking lol, grow some balls
Both me and my calls agree with this
Where have they been so far?
I'm a pussy
I don't want to talk about it and literally any price.
pain
They gonna learn today
He is paying $3 per day, <CRACKS WHIP>
I guess you hate money
NICE
100% accurate
boat missed?
I am long shares and calls...I agree
That's fair. Thanks for playing. Bulls turn now?
Theyll be back. And in greater numbers
agreed
Its being shorted
Im fine all time. But today I lost around 7k
> Bet

Yes.
Right, I sold when I was down 28%
It was already 29 this morning
SEC this comment right here
I picked up some shares, Im hoping this call gets filled tho 
Exactly why I acquired shares
Yup
You dont like the squeeze?
Agreed, gotta take the red days with the green days. Looked like I was on pace to give back a months worth of gains for a bit, but it's recovered. I'm long on most stuff, but there is that immediate gut punch of "I think I got baited by greed"
Fortunately (maybe?) I make saner decisions when I'm losing money than when I'm gaining.
Very bullish
The retarded one, not the gay one.
Oh man you're right. Hindenburg did call out NKLA first. Citron jumped on the bandwagon a day later.
All in rite aid. Got it boss
2 weeks
Thanks man, she needs the company rn.
Yea, hopefully its not the witching hour all over again.
Everyone here trades OTM weeklies which will blow the fuck up on a 5% day. Theta takes no prisoners.
*scratches neck furiously* yall got any more of those calls at 200% IV???
Are you trying to tell me that stocks can go up *and* down??? Shocker.
1/11/21 $40 1c

12/11 $40 6c

12/4 for a $29 strike 1c
No doubt, good riddance to that ass clown
Im def holding m8. Im so good at holding tbh. All from the experiences of holding my options till they expire worthless. 

But GME, opted for some shares for this bad boy. Kinda gay I know but hey we all suck dick sometimes right
I am otherwise I woulda been up 20%  got some big bags now tho lol
looks like a wedge to continue downtrend.  idk wtf youre seeing
what what? tell me its coming up.
I feel personally attacked

If you think gme is a better play than pltr long term your retarded. Gme short term, pltr long.
Thats the way.
Nah I was only going to smoke half of it
I would but I still live with my parents
Hours plan ahead
This
If youre a value guy, go with GME. If youre a growth guy, go with PLTR.
I went for the exit. I think the momentum is shifting to Gamestop. I also wanted to put my money in companies I did some actual DD for over the weekend lol.
IF YOU PANIC, YOU LOSE. 

YOU PLAY RIGHT INTO MM HANDS AND THEY BUY YOUR SHARES CHEAPER. 

HELLOOOOO CAN YOU HEAR ME BACK THERE
It sucks because I can imagine how many new retail investors there are here that could avoid the mistake if they didnt panic or act on emotions
GME @18.11 $7mil PLTR @27.17 $5m
what bombing in Iran?
No
Nagger
I don't recommend short term calls for GME but if you are looking for a quick flip than they are the way

if you're looking to play the squeeze I would suggest January to April calls though
u rly guna listen to some guy who named his username sweattysack69? but yeah GME can go upto 20 by then trust me im a fucking snoowalruses7854
TTM Squeeze indicator suggesting a big move coming
fuck no
it only works if we all believe
doesn't matter, too much autists bought today and if they hold 3-4 more days, we should be gucci
AMZN BACK FROM THE FUCKING DED?!?!?
Ill be rich from NKLA dying in the next two weeks so idc
Im coming back from the dead. Down $57 and counting
got 1k might get more, what level do you see consolidation?
i'm sitting on 120K of fresh tendies from the last 5 hours of trading, how's your day so far?
Cant imagine. Too gay.
I had my ps5 in my hand and I didnt hedge my profits for what? More tendies? I deserve this.
Smd

I may. Im going to see how it does tomorrow tbh, before i sell.
I still have faith 
How many years has it been since it was 30?
> Worry 

oh yes, i am.
I'll have to set mine to 24.99
Weak hands selling for profit

Sometimes you need to be prepared to bite the pillow.
yeah, wtf is the point of this besides GM trying not to look like retards for almost partnering with a fraudulent company?
Genuinely believe it could reach 30-40 by mid December based on the hype building in WSB
You didnt though still has a ways to run
We fukt or what ?
half was in TSLA, half in cash.   Avg down toward the bottom by another 1/4
The ATH is predicated on a lot of things. My prediction, however, is a conservative 50 EOY, just on fundamentals. Any short squeeze beyond that is a nice bonus.
More than $2 for sure
Gotta give the people what they want!
That makes them easy to catch.
Good point. I just saw that I could, and never stopped to think about if I should. But fuck it
Are you me? Lol
Sounds very familiar...luckily expiry is January so hoping it might recover or rather gain some lol
Well contracts went from 4700$ value to 530$. Now I'm either losing the rest or recoup some money at least if the stonk go back to 32 eow. Either way I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING
high motherfucker high af
I sure as fuck hope so!
Serious question: are you buying the new console from GameStop. Cuz Im not
Goes down? Buy more.

Did you find out what the r word is???
People havent bailed, the meme stock day traders moved to PLTR and left the long term true believers to rake in the $$$
Yes, sorry dont like linking stuff but you can google they are raising guidance from initial nov 10
2 or 3 hundred\*
I never scroll down past Daily page
How you feeling that you couldve been 19% up today buy u choose to be gay instead

Yessir 
ngl almost died when i saw it dip

More than likely
You too homie. I cant wait to lick all the door handles at work tomorrow and spread COVID cheer
I'm getting calls rn it's not going under 26.50
Why sell before the announcement?
Who needs love when we can get tendies
Not winning rn
Nothing to worry about friend, just hold.
They all bought GME at the top while PLTR was down hitting $24.

Fucking geniuses
retards waiting for a squeeze that wonthappen
actually. its the ones who put their hand up on your hip.

when they dip you dip we dip.
Damn! If I werent in, Id yolo for this DD.
yes
upside down, west, and backdoor.
PLTR XPEV NIO CRSR and Tesla , short term calls. Its slowly climbing back up but down 22% overall
could be all of our short term call options, just stall the market out and fuck everybody over.

who  knows, i just know it is fucked up and shady.

&#x200B;

im looking at 10 charts of stuff I own and every single chart looks like a mirror, it's so bizarre
yeah, efficient in taking all short term call and put option money and laughing all the way to the bank....shit is so fucked up
How much u down
Congrats. Hope GME will squeeze and you could get out 
APHA
Aphria Inc. 

Do you mean which position?
Imagine that
I have shares and dont bother selling calls because the premium is shit.
Just set a sell order. Fuck this stock.
Again
Likewise. Sold $40K APPL shares the other night, already made sick gains and no ragrets.
Also iPhone sales weren't reported last earnings. iPhone 12 sales will be huge

Lmao. Do u think there are any legit Q believers on here? I know were retarded and all but thats another level
You don't think it will crash after earnings next week?
He took out his initial investment + 100k a few weeks ago I think
PLTR is a casino.

$20K on, but never on red...
Amazing
For real lmao
Theyre too distracting trying to hit 500% on weeklies 
So youre saying my domestic shorthair is a little chubby?
Rog

Thats how business work. Sweep the competitors off. Lemme steal your profits man
Scared toilet paper handed bitches. Time to stock up on even more shares lol
All the indexes are down, it's not just PLTR.
I own it at 21 average, went in at IPO. I've been trying to sell puts today, but they were still down as it fell

ITM puts for 12/4 are still down lol
HBD
So far
Good call, you will be fine long. My calls sure fucking aren't though
To you its probably like a couple hundred bucks. He barely felt that drop.
Hmm thats not me, I wish that was the case you retard
You clearly dont yolo
Fuck u man, I care 
Yerrrrrrrrrp
Thats the sick part about shares bro. You can believe without getting fucked by theta. No need to worry about no IV crush no OTM ITM ATM bull shit. Lmao idk its kinda gay but I like it
Not really? Its pretty consistently stayed above 18 all day
My 12/4 30 calls will need more than that
I bought like 600 shares at $15 and its outgained some green options lol
Super TLDR IV = implied volatility, how much the market thinks it will move in x time, when its high you need stocks to have big swings to make $ on options. ICLN has been a straight line up/flat with no dips for 3 months, usually that would drive the IV up but for some reason its still at 40% for Jan 21 (which is basically average these days) which IMO is a great deal
Lol I was down like 50% now I'm at 30%. Bought a 50c on Nov 25th when it was in the lower 40s or maybe lower 38s.
You think itll hit 565 by friday
Whos the idiot now
Incel confirmed
Youre doing great sweetie! The fact thats its even green right now is a good sign. Hopefully well get back up there in a couple days if the retard strength is back
CNBC is just salty that they keep losing money on their puts
I have about 600 warrants. I'm ready for blast off
New government and commercial contracts means the future is up for the company. This isn't a short play but long hold. So I'll be selling all my remaining call contracts into shares.
gonna be some big dick guidance
Confident about run up to ER.
Im gonna hold it till next year. Weekly i dont know.
Ive left it at 30 shares. Im bad at timing anything so Im reducing my exposure, but if youre more cash flush then yea. Merger announcement hasnt even been made
stocks only go up
If it was up 1000% then dumped to just up 6%... hey, still up 6%, chill.
No. Filled the gap from this morning. Will go up now
Shares to help squeeze 
Calls to profit like a Scrooge
shares to make the dream work 
Till i can buy call for it.
Till $30
Hey, feel free to file a complaint with any of the WSB moderators!  I hope you can recover and have a good Monday, anyway.
Why is it showing 28.35 for me
CRSR is up 1.8%
No theyre not and Im watching many of the wsb favorites dropping right now. Look I hope things turn around but Im feeling a bit  today with the action so far.
Hell yeah!!

Fuck that old man. Give him a walking stick!
This shit is just bleeding tf u mean
Nah boi land lord gang still charge money but Ill let you smoke weed
Agreed. Fake ass hoe has been posting about PLTR everyday. Thot probably has 5 shares.
Not really
Okay fair enough
The only thing... the one true stonk
PLTR, TSLA and NIO happened king
You're a paper handed lil bitch :)
You spelled *tendies wrong
Never ever
These are the most important 3 words
I moved them out to January so thats good I guess. Also most
Id them were all in profit
Hit up Wendy's if you want immediate tendies. I suggest a side of honey mustard to dip them in
I'm sorry my friend but no, earnings is going to start the actual squeeze.

Edit: Guys, there are actual details on this sub about what's expected on the earnings call. This isn't the standard "let's see what numbers they release". Go read about the potential play from RC if GME doesn't deliver on earnings.  You're right that nothing is a sure thing but we have reasonable expectations based on info available.
and stop overleveraging lol
I literally hit the mf cash out button at the peak of what profit i could have made when the app broke.
Actually 0 PLTR to my great regret but seems like everything is moving like that just to a lesser degree.
I haven't looked but how could they possibly have awful financials? It's literally almost all user generated. They should have hardly any costs.

Hows it a p&d if Im up 10% and can only lose 10% max because of the buyout clause if the merger fails
400k shares. The number of shares doesn't change. Sure you made money, but your too stupid to even make the equation to calculate your profits.
Just dont get paper hands my boy
I dont think you got the joke.
who knows it literally never happened this way before
VFF
I suspect its shorted a lot more now. Dealing with a lot of downward pressure.
Your like a year behind on actual news
Is this some kind of zoomer joke that I'm too boomer to understand?
Before it drops further.
you and me both.
Cryptobalding
Its already happening lmfao? Up 89% this month
The new cult
THC
Tuscan Holding Corp - B. The ticker is banned because the market cap is <$1B and this subreddit doesn't want another SEC investigation
We all need to support each other during these rough times 
But Im down over $400. Bought at $40 
Same with me. I bought at $24 and rode it till $46. I jumped in today at $40 as it seemed like a reasonable price but now Im down. No idea which way itll go... guess I need to hold till earnings
Holy fk. I hope the best for you and me 
Congrats man, wish I could say the same
In all honesty, $35
Unfortunately I agree with that it rose too fast but Ill use it as another buy opportunity if it dumps. Im in for 5 yrs on it at least. Interesting their IPO target price was supposed to be $80, but went for direct instead
Its climbing back in Pre market
You're good. BABA call holders have high pain tolerance.
Look like we do that $600 this morning!
That's my gut feel.
Yup. It's "THE" end game. Epic proportion type stuff...
This is true I need to go somewhere sunny
Its kinda sad. This sub could make so many tickers moon lol. NKLA needs to die fr though. I hated Trevor when I saw my first picture of him. IDC if hes involved anymore NKLA needs to die.
Send me your big DD bb
I should have. I wouldve gotten 33 likes and 7 fuckers sending me rocket ships. Instead I post Macy puts and its quieter than my girlfriend when we have intercourse.
Lmao hope pltr moons for you
Tomorrow (Dec 1st) are when 166m shares unlock for sale from investors/management.
Just go like wayy otm & hold until Trevor sells his shares
Riot mara are the plays
Alright c'mon. Now it's time to pump lmao
Cant sit inside (COVID)
Ive usually made enough bad decisions by then lol
Aapl is at least a real company and potentially can get back to that price.
This phrasing needs to be updated from its 1926 origins. You think the hourly employees at Amazon are making a dime for every dollar big daddy Bezos makes?

Risk it for the biscuit, shit's gonna rocket higher the rest of this week
Im not really a technicals guy but if you look at the RSI, a correction was coming.
Dude, it works everytime. I dont know why I did it.
I just feel PLTRs product has way less hype than EVs uber-retardation which NIO profits off
They Must be gay bears. 
Positions:
Calls on Bidens ankle 1/21/21

Why 8 specifically?
Make it stop dude, what the fuck?!
Oh I thought it let you day trade, or atleast margin to do it maybe not
I will go with 32 breakeven january
At this rate it will be 100+ by EOY-mid January. If it hit $30 in the next week or two Ill be happy, but that might be too hopeful. 

Palantir did it in like 3 days though so who knows lol.
FWIW my PT for eod is $18 which if it maintains we could see another huge surge tomorrow.
look at that IV! shiiieeeettttt
Insane? No, we are just autists
Shooters gotta shoot baby
That would be nice but I dont know about that lol

Not actually a weed stock, despite what Robinhood says
That we're mooning tomorrow!
21 Jan 22 C 12.5 at $1.60, a few hundred worth of monthlies for gambling, and 20k worth of shares
If it hits $625 will you buy me a PS5?  Thats the way this works, right?
When are yours expiring?  Mine range from 12/24 to 01/15

+7% would be fine tho
[Tuscan Raiders Rise](https://www.starwars.com/databank/tusken-raiders)
It's all about the mtree
M3>M2>M1
So what you dont think its going to go up anymore? I mean it has 1bn in revenue and 3.5bn market cap. Surely the MC go to a range of 5-8bn or not?
Yep
Uh cause its been fucking flat as shit for >3 months tying up my capital?
Correct, and they dropped down to .02 during the intraday dip from $119.3 to $116.8 - it was a flash crash and I took advantage. Although .02 isn't my actual cost average since I bought some at .03 as well - guess cost average is around \~.023
Yeah hold on boys its gonna be a bumpy ride for Nikola this week.
It's on the 3rd.  I thought all the dumping started today.

Fuck..  that gives me more time to add on puts.

He is definitely dumping all 91 million shares.  It's his lotto ticket.  He worked hard shilling and creating power point presentation - it's time for him to get paid

Zero chance, but that would give me an erection
Stripe has really good funding already but dont take away from this mans greatness. Either stripe or AI... yes AI
Nice, thanks for the term lol

All money in the economy goes towards space travel? I like it
I play calls weekly and take profits. In case it ever dumps like this morning, buy in repeat.
Okay so idiots who bought today, makes sense
2 dumps were due to coordinated bear attacks for fake news on MSFT deal and then the election week market selloff
You're proving his point because not a single BMW retails for that much
I agree the M3 and old M Coupe are the only cars that are not subject to my statement.
Dont ask, tell!

Diversification? What is this shit, /r/investing?
"Wait for a drop" *PLTR proceeds to drop at 40 to 35 and GME from 30 to 25* 

Just buy half now and half in case it drops, anon.
Position?
Probably because people are remembering its literally a dogshit company that hasnt successfully brought a single vaccine to market in its 30 year history?

December starts tomorrow. Hmmm
Youre paying commission?

If I lived in Ghana I might.
If you lived there you would.
nothing to see here, folks.
Buffy comforter here too. Solid choice, man. No prob at all paying that money for a place that you spend 8hrs a day
Exactly, the TA was promising though, Im just a fool...
Jokes on him then, my calls cant go any lower than $1 at market open.
I have small holdings and I agree.  Solid choice.
Yes sir. I grew up on those Image comic books and exactly where that username was pulled from. 
Thats true. Its kind of a Greek tragedy in a way: brought high through memes and brought down because even the memes were not dank enough to support its rise
Totally.  And if Theranos had working technology then it would have been world changing.  NKLA is just a shitty car company with no cars.
Meh, 5/10
Listened to a podcast on it from stuff you should know, sounds awesome
Any recommendations?
Same but holding these leaps while reading all this Palantir and GME hype has me wanting to sell AND FOMO HARD AS HELL. But diamond hands
Regardless, I hope my 12/4 Calls PRINT 
which option

Hows ur nut?
Thanks
XPEV WAKE THE FUCK UP YOU LAZY CUNT
Definitely thinking about it
bought last week and had a sell point in mind, saw it rocket and think 'oh im not selling there anymore' and now its below that sell point haha. just me being dumb
Day trading weekly calls
Money is already out of my account. If I win I win and if I lose I lose, thats what a casino is all about baby!
nah u can but u most likely gonna lose money
 
Holding, hoping for a pump and then getting out. Right now down 77%, hopefully that'll shrink to sub-40% making it a bit more palatable.
In theory: Shares and not calls can force the squeeze. But, do what you feel more comfortable with. 
I hope so! But a lot of paper hands might have sold.
I was still green but watching my ps5 vanish in front of me when just 3 days ago it was in my hands was sheer pain
I did not see that 555 dip, should've bought some shares then, damn
I made so much from my other calls I dont care about losing it all on this so until the end of the week or till I see the surface. Never playing weeklies again tho lmao
I bought at 14 then I FOMOed more at 18.90 lol. I'm 3,500 shares and 50 calls deep. Might have to up that to 5,000 shares if it drops below 18 again
Totally agreed. I dont know how people dont realize momentum cant continue to last forever which makes their buy completely pointless
never choose a side forever, you can always switch... follow the trend
good
Yeah this is such an anti climax so far. I was promised the world with thc_
Dec 3 is the vote
KGC to 15 from here GO GO
At $15
Split between 32 call contracts and about $7k in shares. 

I did average up a bit this morning though
Sir, you are a gentlemen and a scholar.
Haha losers! 
\^\^\^ Same here, TSLA bull. But we're playing around in unknown territory and it \*feels\* like another dip is coming. I hope I'm wrong though. 

Position: 600C 12/11
OK FUCK IT IMMA GO IN
LI?
Down 1% get it right
Are you new or did you just forget what TSLA is capable of?
Canuck what?
Can you just give the dates?
He got GME long time ago
Yeah! Bought some different companies. One happened to be banned here. Hope it turns out well.
If you panic sell SHARES you're legally required to hand in your man card; the only acceptable excuse is using the proceeds to go in on calls.

Strong hands you fuckin puss.
Scrambling to figure out how to do this on Robinhood
true, this is the only exception
They dont deserve protection and should square up
Oh alright thats fine then
You have two options there, get perma-banned, or have a constant aftertaste of Trevor's clumpy cum.
Volume too low for sustained red.
Did we learn our lesson ;)?
I'd give it til tomorrow morning before buying in, could sink just as easily
true, but I'm betting it's not - at least not fully.
I got in 800c 12/31 this morning and it has been drilling my asshole since then.
It at least gets to 30 by WED so if youre down and you sell.. you got paper Mario hands
I read this somewhere else too. Just curious, what makes this a should?
Not necessarily. Ive just been in this position before. Might go cash gang and bank on a bigger dip to load up on calls
APHA so much better potential
Good shout, if both will return profit, then better play it safe. I am gonna take a 2k hit on AYRO and drop that hot garbage for APHA. Do you think it will drop after the vote on Thursday? Not familiar with US politics, but I am guessing it can moon even more if the vote passes?
Thats one of the better descriptions of ACB that I have heard.

Nah I bought them at .90
Still high then but dont get me wrong i would never pay the premium for them right now
Amzn still not doing shit.
No
I'm genuinely curious as to why it wouldn't follow

If anyone knows, please tell me lol
Yes well, this is only after 5 hours of market time.  He could be down that exact amount by EOW or simply tomorrow morning and then he would have really saved. - Read the real value of the comment before responding with lunacy next time please.
just saw it on CNBC a few min ago.
What strike prices?
Yes, I own one and I'm going to shit into it.
I was thinking of massive mexican food shits. But that sounds better.
Better than jumping in when it's 
probably 650 12/4s
haha I don't think you qualify as kiddo here
right, I forgot about the inevitable loss porn.
People selling but also people getting in means stock is neutral when there's alot of volume.
It generally means shares are being accumulated slowly. Reduced volatility is a good time to load without fear of big intraday moves up or down. Obviously no one knows whos buying unless you analyze L2 and look at the buys filed at the end of the week, but flat days are a good sign in my opinion after big volatility like we have had the last few weeks. Just my two cents
Runup??? Its been trading flat for 5 fucking months
Yessir
Ive got boomer shares, Ill be grand
The key is forward looking statements and revenue projection updates.

That seems to be what is moving the market right now.
Yes
Yeah me too, I am not retarded enought to buying calls on the promise of a squeeze that has been flying around months by now
Unfortunately everyone around me has been f****** their life up and I'm just sitting over here slowly stacking money and I figure it's time I help some people out
Resistance broken and closed above the neckline.  Moon time.
Imagine being as retarded as me.
How retarded do you have to be to get a handicap tag?  Asking for myself.
Hold strong, weve got through the worst of it
Thats the problem. No one will say

This message is intended for new traders, to help them avoid costly mistakes. If you do your research and know what you are doings, then it doesnt apply to you.

I was up $1800 on NKLA this morning but now Im only up $350 bc I have really shit options. Amazon killed me this morning
wow!

I'm in.
13% could be the catalyst though. Once the first MM covers, all bets are off.
That's what u get for doing weeklies
switch to spreads bby.
Shouldve picked PLTR
Solid #s with PLTR, not just a meme stock. Oh whats that? $300,000,000 aerospace contract? Rumoured good news is incoming with PLTR so we will see...
So negative lol
Without the zero
Just want 20 by eow
 God! These people can't even do something different

Look we cant all be winners ok
Dont have any yet. Will prob buy 20p 12/11. If its still affordable at 8:30, shes dropping hard right now.

Should have bought puts on Friday, but I spent that money PLTR calls, you know like a true retard
What story? I wasn't actually referencing anything. I had a boss earlier this year that told me in May or June that I would be able to retire early if I just listened to him about NKLA. i told him to buy NET
Shares?
No calls? Just shares?
Im big on THC
I think its got a ways to go up in the next few weeks.

which dildo you have?
Very solid advice.. this is the way
Its proven to work so many times in a row that statistically its significant - this market is so powerful any red gets bought up straight away
You love to see it
Man? You sure thats what it says? Lol
Fucking tell me about it... going thru it rn.

I had a limit set at 25. If I could go back I wouldve cancelled. Was hoping to go long.
I have no idea; I'm using my Ballzitched strategy mixed with Hopium and pour memory.
Not for everyone, only for investors who voluntarily agreed to extend. I dont think it will go to zero tomorrow but there will be a significant sell off
Sure. From my years of following CGC, TLRY, ACB, and APHA on average when weed stocks pop hard it's either because sector rotation or anticipated sector rotation.

I've rarely seen days when weed stocks and tech are up together.

You gotta make money to lose money. - Warren Buffet
I dont think its a bad idea
You could buy X x 100 shares and sell 1C 12/18 for 50+% of the investment right off the bat holy shit

Only downside is if the stock goes down more than 50% by then
I honestly couldn't believe how many days we'd be up like 2% early and everyone goes. OK that's enough for me, time to sell.
Lol right? Shoutout to people winning in life. Shit is not easy no matter how it may feel. I win a trade with stonks and argue with my gf or fumble the ball with my business or vice versa. Relationship is amazing and stonks are red. Cant win em all just take the good with the bad and press forward
Duh
Thanks. What's the play for APHA? Thinking end of dec slightly OTM calls. Bad idea?
First time?
oh GAWD, I hope so.

I mean, yeah, but it seems like shitron has a hard on for the meme stonks.
Picked up 12/18 40c at $36. Doing pretty deece
Its been dipping for a whole week
I hope weed makes you a millionaire , you deserve with this position and confidence
Yeah, I deff need to get more comfortable with letting contracts sit as well. Missed out on a couple hundred with PLTR
Fucked around and got caught. Damn. Should have cashed out Friday morning when I was up 300%.
I have etrade and it always takes like 3 days for transfers, probably cause I have a cash acct though

Meant earning, autocorrect messed it up. Today was the 3rd and last day of profit taking, Corsair had an amazing Black Friday weekend and probably even better Cyber Monday. This thing is going to jump like crazy this week.
Hahah fuck that god damn wall

Dude..... come on...... I was drunk and it was very late and the lack of teeth actually made it pretty cool.
Doing all I can broski

Im just waiting for IV to settle a bit to jump back in.
It gonna go back down to 118. Ive been bagholding shares since pre-stock split.
Just not feeling it now it already moved already cozy with my GME calls and IWM puts
Good luck though It has a nice Chanel up
I tried to warn you
it started dropping so I panicked and I dont have $5k cash in buying power
well you need $5k in buying power and my cash is tied up in Apple
buy the dip
This is one week Ill play these companies. Otherwise I am out. Probably closing everything Wednesday and maybe keeping a couple runner lottos open for the vote.
What if I told everyone you could do both... and have even more play money later this week
I didnt unfortunately
wtf you talking about there's tons of option volume. but IV is approaching 300%
How you know bro?
Ahh interesting. Probably my DISCA where the volume is 15 and open interest is 1244. Does that mean anything? Is it going to moon?
Think is big boy stronk
I wouldnt consider gme a safe buy. 

That being said Im all in gme because it has the potential to be amazing.
> IPOD opened today. Look at SPCE, IPOB for ref. You can get in early or wait until people are tired of NIO 

Today? No. It was on the market for months
Yup, bad news
I blow you a virtual kiss if this happens.
I hope so.
Good play, snagged some 25c weeklies myself pretty much at the bottom and sold 15 minutes later for a little under 100% gains myself. Crazy movement
i literally dont know where i spend the money. the only two purchases i have planned for 2021 is a basketball hoop in the spring and a computer that can play wow BC early 2022 lmao. i really got everything i want in life materially

im just gonna keep stacking and living normally
Well they should. That means its boutta drop
Nerd
I honestly haven't done any fundamental analysis and have never touched it and will continue to avoid it, but without the GM deal, idk what they have? They will just have to dilute and try to actually make a real product? haha idk, just seems like a shell of a company that fucked over a ton of investors

Srsly tho, everythings tanking hard and PLTR is holding surprisingly well.
Not sure significance tbh
retarded but very courageous
I know....gotta let my winners ride and stop playing both sides.  Oh well...mad a bit on gme and ptrl puts.
It made me 12k last time it dropped because I averaged on the way down from 275-260 so Im 
Yeah we need a double digit day.
Probably happens when it's officially confirmed

They force third party companies to pay a fee if their product works through USB. SteelSeries would have to raise the price of the product if they paid the fee, so they decided to not pay and just forego Xbox altogether. 

Fuckin MSFT.
Looking to get higher quality than that tbh

Stonks in a company I think is gonna partner with Tesla.

And Tesla Options bought last week & during the dip.

PLTR to the moon :rockship: 

high quality
The word for those is 'rules' and I assure you they exist. Not only that, I added annoying fucking automod replies that badger the submitter if they're using an important flair years ago and people still act like they're not getting PMed what not to do *EVERY* time they post.
Brag? A lot of this is just us trying to get people to understand that we do a shitload even when it doesn't look like it. People think we're asleep at the wheel and it's far from the case.

You know we remove like 200 submissions (not comments) on a typical day? 300 so far in this 24 hour period.
>only want people who have made meme comments to be able to submit
Trying to moderate the comment section in this sub is like drinking from a firehose. I gave up on that shit years ago.

They have to file for extension on Dec. 3. Extension would go until April but people are speculating that they will announce the merger shortly after the extension.

Yes. The financials are outstanding but Wall Street hates China. Long dated is the way to go in my opinion
yeah, way high, which considering the play here is to trigger a squeeze, that's good
Thats pretty conservative
LMFAO

lmfao
Already up on em.
This week
Nice!  I would've tried that but the taxes would've wiped out a lot of the gains for me.. hoping to hold until January at least..
that's fair.  long term for me though, and hope it works out!
Lol I was hovering it. But the premium is just to high even for weeklies.
Need more buyers to break resistance rn
Thank you!

Ask him his positions too.
Just historically it recovers a majority of losses AH if it drops a day
ACB GANG!
Not sure but theres been talks that it could come in the next week or 2
Thanks! Most of my account is in leaps or shares, so I felt like exposing myself to a little bit of upside.
Yeah, it's not great numbers wise, I bought it based on gut feeling (good news + potential upside triggers in the news). Hence the lunch money.
Shit If this goes to $30 Ima be so happy
27 is right around where I'm thinking. 3,750 warrants so it's a sizable position - not selling yet, just planning.
hold or sell and just leave the market for this week
Stocks only go up
Already tits up and 100% up on APha :)
Oufffff wouldnt that be a dandy.
Nah. I got burnt earlier on that
Just got the money bro
Already tits up on AMD. Something else
Me too, new price target is 650, s&p soon, papa Elon

Yes
Corsair Gaming is like Logitech's Sister. Undervalued and should be worth atleast half its marketcap alone. Sells gaming hardware. Look them up on their investor relations page. They also have very strong fundamentals so its a great buy and hold even with shares

Could there be any way this announcement will make Tesla drop? I understand the announcement is just about how TSLA will be added to the S and P. My assumption was that this was priced in last week. Then TSLA dipped today. Wondering if there is some news that we dont know regarding their entry that could explain todays dip.
Yep...waiting on the announcement
**GUH**
Were you... dating your landlord/boss?
Link?
Only up 19% 
apple
Sell order on apple
I have 10c 1/8
I think this is 09/2018 - 10/2019 all over again, huge run up followed by maddening low volatility
...why lmao
edit 1k not enough for those
Bought this dip.. mooning
What? Im up 50% on the puts and 20% on the calls.
Buddy if I knew Id be trying to sell you my online investment course for only $59.99
Im doing weeklies , my avg share price is $25. Doing -7x dec4 $32c
I did mention it in the weekend thread but no one probably read it.
I mean at this rate RKT, GME, and SFT will put me there
Sama also rose 16% after aquisition. Nodoubt  will give atleast 50% return.
ahh, reality...the only thing that's not priced in

Stop being a bear and make some money lol
Pft who buys shares. All in FDs

As in tradition we will swap wives. Its only right!
Shit I hope so Im 4 contracts deep in 850 calls 12/11 EXP
I dont think its going to as crazy as they say my PT end of month is 30
Literally all of that loss is PLTR FD's because I'm a true retard and this is my home. Everything else was pretty flat.
For sure since I bought a lot of calls on that dump
I only let   pound me
Well if he gets pounded either way then he didn't lie did he?

Lol.
Exactly. The more people that pile into GME, the "worse" the squeeze will be. Literally exponential.
Same with DKS
If you buy into a company only because of hype....big yikes.

This man shoves his combo draws like a g

Why not?

Jesus Christ man, there are some things you don't talk about on Wall Street Bets.
Sir , this is a plane
If only 1% if Wallstreetbets buys $10,000 worth of shares we can trigger the SQUEEZE
This 
Commenting
I hope it hits $100 for you
It literally went down Friday what more do you retards want
Everyone knows corporations are people too
might be a VERY quick double up or triple up
I bought and sold GME months ago for 75% profit this stock is old news you pumper shill
Nobody obviously, but there are way too many pumper posts lately especially the momentum PLTR GME NIO crowd
Im in at 10.60 so Im not too worried.
cocaine and hookers for all

Maybe today yes, but the rust isnt over
12/31 calls, 33 and 35.
only if my right is your wrong
yup, dont let them shake you

They expire on Friday

In his defense, he didn't specify which way it would be blasting.
I made a few hundred off them this morning but sold 
My gut feelings
INFINITY SQUEEZE
Super shit buying experience compared with AMZN tbh..
double the pleasure, whats the prob
Will it be stripe?!??!?!?!?!!
Earnings in 8 days. Hold till then? What are your thoughts. I didnt look in to it yet
Yessssss
Ready to be dave Lee's wife's boyfriend.
Because its a stonk
Yeah I know, that's why I FOMO'd in last Friday, just up until now there was hardly any movement... boring Germanosphere won't buy into weed...
Good job 
I know, but do you think retards arround here can trade US weedstocks that are not on Robinhood yet?
Pltr is soooo last week my boi
If you trust the power of stocks who become meme, I'd say ACB
Ok thats what I was thinking but what about selling CSPs?
So you think I should buy immediately? I made this mistake past friday with PLTR and we all know how that went lol
im going for the hypothetical squeeze but im using x5 leverage so my broker only allows me to lose 50% of my investment before it closes automatically, so I can't buy too high lol
TLRY, ACB, APHA  all will moon
Hes making me sleep outside with the dog
it's probably the best time imo
Guidance will be absolute ass. Which means they may not give it which can also be bearish.

Its less about earnings and more about outlook.
Not sure I havent been following closely since I just figured it was a fraud company, but CNBC just announced that a deal with gm has been signed, but no details of that deal yet. Knowing nikola its a big fake out before they cash out their shares lol
Actually they just pulled back out! Shares down 18% so far. Game on!
Oh god, this is going to be retarded. Thanks.
I have no idea but seems to be on a hurried mission to $100
And?
Headed towards previous high of 64, held resistance at 32 been mooning since. Currently holding 65c 3/21, looking to sell soon and extend until next football season start
TD
Thanks
Ya I wish, I need like 10k more lmao
Plan was to hold through Dec 1st for more drilling once insiders can sell
Hence me using the word lately. Been slowly dropping/stagnating the past few weeks
Okay, so you saying it's over is probably a good sign. Keep it coming.
It's up 3% now. Say something mean again. I think you're the key
It's going to double soon. December 13th is vaccine day.
I usually exit a position when they get too excited, Inversing Stocktwits is a win 110% of the time
Hes punching the air right now
lol he's just gotta sit and watch the red alllll friggin day, love it, fuck him
Isnt it today
Congress votes Thursday or Friday this week, UN votes by Dec 2, Mexico signs legislation by Dec 15
they are 600m marketcap, why would you sell. Merger isn't even finalized until Q1
I'm shooting for 25-30 but we will see if things slow down
are underwear put in the laundry or the garbage after a shart?  soupy mud so the stain won't come out either way
Already did on Friday
I see so many get f fomo into bees then it craters
Waiting til news about acquisition is announced
Earn by doing research and having some luck.
Tomorrow??
It looks compelling. Down 39%.  if anyone is trying to sell those calls, I want it down 60% so please bring in the cyber Monday deals.
Good luck friend, may the tendie fairy visit you.
Yeah me too but it's no worries. I'm in at a nice price, and I gotta have at least one long term stock lol
I hope not lmao
But why the fuck though
Glad to hear it man. Same up 54% right now with my 12/4 calls
Don't worry, some other retard will buy puts and it will go up. That will be me. I will sell my call for puts. I am that retard
same here
With how high on the short % is, no. The short is 3x the float. In order to clear that off the books GME would have to double at least probably a lot more.
Oh lawd he stonkin!
Particularly the crew that bought in above $30
The second you see the memes its too late to get in haha
yeah glad it was up for like 5 minutes cause I sold my BABA LEAPS
YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH
thats ok i buy more
I jumped out too. Its a shame that it didnt jump more compared to the other SPACs. Still made an alright profit but I had much higher hopes
 hand those bad boys
Sure.
why ? bad news ?
you need to wait for the merger news
uhhh that hasn't mattered all year, so try again
waiting for TSLA entry rn
Not at all. I would consider you to be a smart person.
My Jan 40c position is not happy about this lol
I can agree with this assessment
huh?
Shares for me too. I didn't chuck too much at it so not that bad.
I didnt, it was around 40
**30x now baby**
**I AINT SCARED OF NOTHIN**

Waiting for the shorts to cover
How bad was yours. its like 2x cheaper in premium rn. I want die lmao.
You will regret when announcement comes. They have til 1st week in Dec if im not mistaken
Naw I just got fucked with my purchase time.
I already told you, my order got filled for a call
Same. Glad i chose feb calls
Amen
SO there literally aren't anymore shares to sell?
As my portfolio grows and my gains add up its easier to deal with. Im up 118% this year, 7568 to 16,500. If I can keep contributing and keep doubling my money quicker than average I think Im on a good path.
35C dec 11
it means the company is strong and you should buy it because they did better than they should have
I aged 15 years seeing it drop
Medium large.
PLTR is gonna make me a millionaire in 10 years
Im not dropping $60 on another cod. Ill buy Cold War when its on sale in two months
CW is ass
Still holding strong
What makes you think it wont rank after earnings?
Nah man. I diamond handed my calls  all the way to bottom lol
Yeah I like to buy at close. Wouldn't worry a whole lot about IV here though. This fucker's going down
When
Fuck it's not dipping 
Needs more 
Why not have bigger balls and go for 55c?
1k on crsr gives like 25 shares

With options I can possibly profit off of 100 shares for the same price
28 and 30c 4/16

. Dial 
Growers get it now its on robinhood
Shit im scared, should I cut my losses? Bought shares at 32 and 30
You shoulda waited for the pop to sell them instead of selling at .02
F brah
because i cut 20k of PLTR 12/18 losses at -8% then it hit -12%. Once i saw the -6% i went all in on 12/4 27c. Now im only down 7k today but man
Lol the old aal move
Thanks man, I will invest
Why is it going. Up

Extension vote = theyre serious to do the deal. Just need more time. And that would be bullish. But hey what do I know lmao
will cause a run up...
It will.. I have it too but it will
oh shit I meant 22 lol
Its only the top if u sell mate
Are you dipping back in? I'm up 100% so I'm not sure
Just wondering about AMD is all, just asking because I know a lot of people here are loaded with 100c. Did pick up some APPS, SNAP, and DKNG calls today though.
Cocaine and Craigslist
Agreed. When their stockpile is big enough theyll stop selling into the market and itll rise up, hopefully soon, long on stock either way so no gun to my head 
What would you pick?
$PRFT
Probably a lot of truth to that assumption tbh

So fucking true.

Their founder of Stripe followed some retarded guy shilling a Stripe-PSTH merger on Twitter. That's enough DD for me.
PSTH is not just any old SPAC. Very friendly terms for both shareholder and target, tons of PIPE $$ coming with it, and Ackman and Stripe guys have existing mutual business relationships.

That said, I'm still hoping my dark horse Starlink might be in the mix too.
I want to buy calls but idk whether I should buy now or wait till EOD, what are your thoughts;

650 12/4
700 12/4
650 12/11
700 12/11
its a spac that is planned to merge with Momentus, which is basically a last-mile tug service for satellites
I have leaps so Im not too concerned, but may sell if it becomes meme status later in the run
You think we might see some downies osu?
Nah, just bullshitting. Buying more when it dips.
Looking at NIO but the OI is next to nothing. P/C looks way too bullish :/
Iv crush tho
What do you mean
Ok will continue holding
True true
Idk Im just hoping. But if patterns hold up, it should
Hydrogen its the future get in because its going higher
Curaleaf is my #1, Cresco is my #2, GTI and TRUL are also good.
nio vs xpev
Guys! Look at my account!
yup. hasn't even started yet, but when it does, this will push it even higher because they have to buy even more to cover.
Isnt this shit over with Biden election? Why you guys even have elections when the political agenda doesnt change ?
Until i have a legit answer. So I can google it while im pissed off
30-45 DTE OTM plays show the most time decay along the theta curve. Thats why a lot of thetagang plays in this space.
Im in this and wouldnt recommend.
I bought two weeks ago and screamed for people to buy it in these comments then and two days ago. Tards will be tards
holding

$AMD 90c

$CHWY 75c

$NET $75c

$FB 300c

$AAPL $130c
its not about the earnings - its about the signal. everything's been coiling in tech, slowly consolidating. 

they just need the news to make it happen
Bought otm
Yea, Ive been buying the dips and selling high. Ive done options but not to the extent of yoloing it
And dont panic sell  
So far Im doing well with buying the dips and selling high. I mostly do shares and an occasional options here and there. But never yoloing it
I took profit.. it just that every time I buy a new one my heart starts racing lol. Im still new and Ive been buying on the dip and selling high. Havent really yolod yet
It doesnt matter what crm pays, But for work to sell they have to , the euphoria will carry it to $60 into Jan
Ok boomer.
12/11 125 and 12/31 130
Tbh she could wear a trash bag with holes in it and look fine af
Genius!
Good luck!
Good luck man!
Good luck man! Whats the first game you will be getting?
Best of luck to you man, these things happen. I just lost like 2k on AYRO, but im hoping GME can make it back for me.
Earnings is on the Dec 8th right? What do you think it will hit?
Twins!
Brave play to hold it after earnings. Good luck to you
Holding. Hold the line
I got in at 590 :|
I don't think this has anything to be with shorts, only with big players just using this maxive volume day to close their positions without actually dumping the price to red
Guess Ill buy back in tomorrow at the dip. Its almost certain that the merger wont be announced on the 3rd (nor the 7th), fight? Since they asked for extension till April
Been in thiccbee since last week, should I yolo everything I pulled of out PLTR into the  or is it too late?
Why?
I got 1 share and $300 strike puts. Lets see who wins
Mmmh-mmmh-mmmh! Cant get any better than that!
They got a subreddit where they push the pump n dumps, got in a couple & doubled up real quick
same shit... should be 290s... god I should've sold at 285 but it looked like such a healthy bounce... then this fucking news lol
lol well to be fair they are not FDs
lol fucking news cycle fucked a baba recovery... god damn
what's at 530pm
I love ur thinking well go with what u said instead
There's still time to get in on it, plus WSB isn't in it so you know it's good
Need a ticker, mate
Were you talking to me?
those retards made 10x last earnings in september you retard
there are options other than options??? Optionception!
just don't buy NKLA lol
Their earnings
I dont disagree. Shares are not a bad move.

It's the weekly call-holders who are likely living in fantasy land rn
From your mouth to Gods butthole, my friend
I did it for you brother
ill be thankful for a 590
Shorts are desperately trying to make their last stand
the best combo for christmas
I understand that but what caused futures to go red by this much? Any particular news or business as usual?
You right we are going to continue to drop
Does having calls make me a bear bruh?
Ohhhh what happened? Mango murdered Chinese scientist this time around?
Yea if you hate money 
Go live there and you'll see
Its a monument to mans arrogance
he might be referring to the Robinhooders, they can make some stock moves at 9 and tend to move some things sometimes.
Some BS that you need for an updated driver's license. You need a passport, social security card, and two proofs of residency. It's a hassle.
Didn't even take an hour it's already irrelevant
Already sold 400 contracts of 12/4 $30
Nice! That was one of the juiciest dip in months
**OOF.**
Massive oof dawg that shit has to be 2 cents now lmao
Would be hnngghhhh
AAPL $135 by EOW
Not today!
Reeeeeee
Not hating on it just looking over the current management in comparison makes me believe that one will grow more than the other. ACB has had problems for a while now, I remember it being a penny stock at one point
Can't say much as I haven't really looked into their company, but for the next day or so it should run up based on the bill news alone. Just make sure to lock in profits as soon as you feel you've made enough, don't get greedy
All have retard stoner strength. Just dont fall in love take profits and dont look back.
Either 12/1 or 12/2 i think
Saw it on firstsqwawk
Who knows they never added such a huge company and never split it into 2 days
20?
Dont worry same thing happened this morning bunch of us bought in and it dipped. Buy in buddy we can dip a little more
FOMO basically lol. My calls expire 12/18 though, so hopefully that's enough time.
Thats the great reset? Making us own nothing?
No moron, people said it would squeeze but it's a long play. None of you retards listened to the long play part.
Don't be stupid it's suppose to be $1000 by the end of quad witching
MAKE ME EAT IT!!!
Exactly
[deleted]
But we shouldnt be shamed for asking what the side effects are, should we?
And another 40% will refuse because it was developed under  admin.
NOT VACCINES.  
No shit
Yeah, its worse than Ebola according to people like you
No shit. Why now?
Dumb question: If I buy now am I getting it at $16.08 or the $17.70 pre market?
lol that feeling when you actually did buy the top
hahaahahhaahahahahahahahha
For real, that's what made sell everything was seeing the WSB fomo. Always invserse wsb
I bought
sorry what was that
Look what oil did under Obama presidency. Look at what BP has done pre covid. Bidens gonna reinstate all them regulations cut under trump administration well be dependent on foreign oil again and oils gonna spike. Listen man dont believe me lol idc I got mine. Keep an eye on it. I was also the guy telling every not to keep buying in at PLTR for this thanksgiving meth high you all were on. Like crackheads haha 
THC  blasting off 
End of hour
Not for the day but its holding steady at about $27 with this volume which is a great sign.
I bet you were crystal clear after nutting when OSU took down Oregon this past weekend, eh?
I liked "Bee-Bois"
market cap too low imo

It goes to $130 by end of next week. So pick your lambo
Manipulating the market when it's down shit loads and we're in the middle of a pandemic is one thing.  Goosing it when we're at all time highs with no signs of slowing is fucking criminal.
Eh, it will always work provided that Fed Funds is at 0% and they're showing a willingness to support the markets with soothing talk.
Down baby! Milton is gonna sell as they fucked him over today with the GM news. There is very little upside going forward, barring a short squeeze.
True.  Im considering changing my strategy to immediately going all in on anything they shit on. They are worthless.
Yahp.
Dude. Gorilla Glue that shit for PS5+ 
I am selling my 130c and going for a way out OTM close expiry and a next jam/feb OTM expiry. Good luck
UPS
How high?
I swear it used to just show the price but just a new blank graph until 9.
Yeah until the actual deal was announced and it was cat shit wrapped in dog shit.  Lol
I believe. Im glad I didnt join the hype on that one
Tomorrow, 12/1 
And whats the chances of that happening?
But like I asked up there^^^ whatre the odds of this actually happening? Like that sounds like a huge deal
Nah its my purchase price that keeps spiking. Its more of a minor nuisance but I can guarantee that I didnt buy it at 13.98 lmfao
Why shares and no calls?
Thats what Im thinking. If he doesnt go to prison he will be a pariah. Better take it while hes got it
Not sure, I bought when the stock was at $31 I think
Only 280%
Analyse he says
I agree. And I am retarded for sure, this is my home
Agreed
it's ridiculous... they buy these ma and pa stores for $1M and they are currently valued at $47M per store as of last week

shady as can be with their accounting practices too
Long calls
JKS, DQ, and SOL atm.
What if angrywhalemama kicks me arse?!?!?!?!
Hoping it is, but I think no matter what company Ackman decides on that it'll be a winner
Good morning 
Enough said, Im all in!
Without the news it was going up regardless lol
Ok thanks
Anything under 30 I thinks a steal
Ill just have to take your word on that.  
12/4
It was a little less than half my shares so not too bad but yeah Ill grow a pair
Good enough youre doing your country proud
I understand that, but it doesnt explain how retarded that is in any case
Of course Sir, its my duty
Nah maybe after a pullback
Time to buy more
No, that is related to the congress vote on wed. BABA is being hit with double whammy of vote + ANT IPO delay.

XPEV is also being bent over.
Where were you to warn me on Friday  you think therell be any upward movement after today?
Scaling out of the position, 20-30% a day. Might buy stock or sell long dated puts.
Still up overall, I was talking about today specifically.
AAPL saving my portfolio right now
How is NKLA going to pay for the fuel cells? It's a fake business!
Will add more under 265
Yes. 2021 only. March and on
Not pumping, I am letting people to get in before it shoots up more.
Yes, but a $15 discount in a matter of seconds is a great chance
The pre-stock split run up was fucking retarded and needed time to consolidate - chart's looking pretty good to me now though
nah i dont touch cfds
12/11 3500. Sold for like $11. Currently $7.
Then I probably should apply for a job again
Nah not me bruhhh, it was sure worth a quick swing trade for some easy $s. Now its worth buying and holding
Already priced in imo. Besides they will have literally 3 years to become compliant if that passes.
Fear. People selling before it goes back into the 20s. Its still in its price discovery phase. 50 was too high and we still have to find out whats too low.
Throughout the last 2 months or so, BABA, CRSR, GPS, and a whole host of others. Seems to be followed by another massive loss shortly thereafter every time.
He definitely bought CRSR
No were good, just anoying because I was up 8k at one point and instead of cashing out it keeps going back to zero lol... I wish Ive made like 30k with this back and forth shit
When has that mattered?
Im sorry to say that I just left and went all in on GME
that's a good thing because these red candles are on no volume what so ever

once the big green dildos with 1 mil volume come back were going to fucking mars
Ill sell off if I just need to cut losses but 5% can easily turn around.
Youre right papa Elon is looking mighty tasty rn 
I've got 4 contracts on it I'm in this with you
Must fulfill the prophecy
FROG
I saw this on last Saturday lol
What would you recommend, just watching it?

I want to! But its just to volatile right now.
Thats a big what if lol
Oh I know January isn't a LEAP. Just read a comment that someone said they were selling their leaps because of today
True.
Yeah expensive lesson learned. At least they were already in
Profit
Thanks! You in for shares or options? if shares I def wouldn't worry about the entry point today
This is the way.
Enjoy your tendies!
Sonos
I'm a risk averse wuss in general, so I tend to steer clear of short plays. I've been taking 10-20% haircuts on profit taking when I try to sell leaps, I was curious if there was a better way. I just started a few short(ish, like 1/15) plays since the market is down, so maybe I'll do this if they hit.
This man has a great point.
One on Seeking Alpha web site.  Can't post link due to automod.
Tell me why Mr. Bill_Buttlicker
Duck
can you sauce me a source? im def thinking about getting in soon
Market's pricing in a 24-25B bid rn
Bout to slip unless JPow stick in more than the tip.
Im short as fuk. But only in the short term. Once theres a little bit more selling, theyll rip this to the moon. But remember, low vol rally is weak. Price matters short term, but high volume selling will wipe it out real fast.
Actual implementation is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is news sentiment.
The bombs bursting in air
Think well be back near there by years end tbh. Super undervalued compared to peers and clearly has some serious momentum. Also w a name like  it just feels memeable
lol if you actually bought at 95.20 you should be proud. Proud as in top retard award winner. Buying the absolute top a short term run up 
You want to sell a retail technology company during the holiday shopping season? ok lol
TSLA is how I turned 7k to 25k. TSLA is also how I blew my account the first time
Yeah the MRNA CEO touched on that subject too. I could have misheard him but he said teenagers shouldn't get the vaccine because they don't have data. Also the ones you mentioned like obese and those having comorbidities shouldn't probably take it.
700s Ive been in and out of $600-700 strikes since the split Im currently up 1000% for the month lmfao
700c for $28 or 29 avg
NYC represent
AMD is the OG goat. I always watch it and rarely ever play it. Just bought 3 calls for fun
I bought in at 113 last week
Bought more at $35 to the cent. The literal bottom. I love myself
What did you buy?
Sold it. Thx homies. Yeah just 1, Ive got to get a better handle on executing all this stuff before I YOLO.
Im holding the cash for Airbnb and R**lox IPO.
Facts. Milk em dry
Yeah I got 1000 in around $16. Thought about loading more around $20 and $21 today but cash all tied up lmao
Actually already did that, was literally the only green thing in the morning in this shitshow.
Hmmmmm, I guess I should trust Elons Number 1 Bitch
Shorting through ER
Great, best answer so far. Loaded up on GME calls
Jeff of course. I will never mess with someone who just got fucked out of $70B. He aint gonna lose again, ever.
Actual cage match
Dont worry its just numbers its not real stay positive
i sold
Fuck it, I got em. Lets ride bby
At least a dollar 
Jan 2022, 320 strike
Holy shit that is awesome
I hopped in
Sorry for you loss lol
Its fine its my first call so Im willing to lose 2k
Also no faceripper days where you make 5k lol. Kinda evens out.
dont go all in?
How does December 18th sound
If only they bought pltr calls lol
since when are you bagholding
why
> Id stay away from Sundial

why
> crlbf

why? looks hyped already
I was just looking at 360p premiums that got wrecked in the past hour.
Every earnings I touch go down..... so naturally it will most likely go up.
Turned my frown upside down
Yeah that was the weakest spike ever. I thought wed at least go to 25 or sum.
Yesss dude, Id rather sell CSPs in hopes of snagging shares I actually want.
Ik, right?! Im still down $600 for the day. Hoping to at least break even by close
Are you not paying attention? The money is flowing out.
Had 40 Jan 15 20c and sold at 80% last week...would of been 3xs more today
Corsair Gaming. You can look that IPO up on your trading app and it will show you what it is
Cuck investors. Its so sad
Biden could executive order reclassifying it or decriminalizing it?
So sell all these shit weed stocks after when lol?
I grabbed 6/18 32c
market knows nothing,MMs are shaking weak hands... CRM is king of SaaS
[deleted]
Holy shit these options are up big
Srs but seen on Twitter fwiw
I always bought jan calls but even they need like 25% move for break even
c-r-y-p-t-p
dats all good, just need THC to go up 40% in day and ill stop complaining
I think ur safer than my 12/4 280c. This bad boy should be recovering back to 300s any day now if the news just gives them a break for a sec
Its not the $ but the opportunity cost, just feels the worst to underperform
Tendies & Tahiti 
Mfw all my donations and cash isn't enough for that greedy sob.
Agree going to sell soon tbh
Down 2% after posting this. Im a stupid cuck
THCBW just buy like 1000 of them and forget about them for 6 months.
What strike price did you sell those puts?
Everything seemed a bit of a bummer starting last week or so. Its like the market wants us to constantly switch to different tickers and not ride a sinking ship for like 10 days straight. This shit fucking sucks lol.
What are you loading up on?
No exact date yet but supposedly early December
No exact date yet but supposedly early December
yep still pltr
Weird cause Ive said the S word before and it never has
I dont think the momentum stops, itll slow down but it still has room to go and should consolidate. Unless we get a market sell off
Note: Shares are available and not be used for shorting; indicating upside, not downside.
what if the $27 support breaks? MMs are at a loss on their target price right?
To fuck my ass
Your moms house
How.... Im 100% on aapl and 300%!for apha
Sell before vote
Sell before vote
No its from the OPEC meeting where they were supposed to announce cuts today but no agreement reached (yet hopefully)
Yes because it can sell off imo with the market from 3-4pm or moon. Why would I risk those gains when 100% all in weekly calls lol

Depending on the inclusion type this could sell off if its 2 rounds no?

Either way Ill just buy in tomorrow Tesla if it moons + zoom is reporting earning tonight so tech might gap
I was thinking ARKQ as well...what sector is ARKG in?
None of my stocks are moving
up 10%, bought 30 minutes ago
Damn, well played! Hope you make $$$$
Dont expect it either tbh, but we will see
absolutely nothing.
Thank you
Ive got calls expiring in May, I expect it to Fucken moon once this vaccine is underway. Im expecting the same with CCL.
Yea with a theta of $300 FUCK
Lmao you been my biggest supporter boss man
In at 12.03 
20 next week would be sick
Got $10k in shares
wtf are you talking about
what u playin
Idc what we close at I just need a nice 363+ open for my 12/2 calls lmfao
That was kind of what I was thinking/hoping. Why I planned a little further out. Jumping in late today, this hurts to see. Wish I had jumped out Friday.
I picked up weeklies at open
i bought 125c 2021 Jan. 3 bucks
mofo just open the options chain its literally 5 bucks you retard
It doesnt seem like shit has even started.
I can't explain why you have TSLA calls.
What do you think weeklies or long?
Anything really, thats kinda my problem Im interested in a lot of stuff but never nailed one thing down. Had an auto grocery list generator app in development but that idea sucked. Other idea was alcohol delivery service which probably would have worked but now the pandemic has made it legal for doordash etc  

Lots of random ass ideas nothing solid yet lol, still working on coming up with something good
Hmmm real estate interests me a lot, I might look into that. My dad an I used to fix houses when I was younger
Im a business owner thanks to  then
I bought $350 and made $10K last time lol... don't think those returns are a possibility but still could get some fat ones
Earings? Hmm...I don't have my ears pierced so I'm good
Momentous suppose to have a delivery this month and ticker name change not until early 2021 so I'm thinking the timing is pretty close
I just loaded up on more shares.
wish i was rich enough to do that too
welp! looks like tomorrow PTON gets my bank account. this buying volume is the start of a serious run up
It was actually like 11k but yeah
yah, this is crazy.  I just picked up some 14/4c $800 and the price is now down about $10 but I'm watching my P/L is now at 14%   LOL

I'm a little embarrassed by how far OTM my calls are, trying to hedge against my terrible judgement lately   XD
Just picked up some cheap calls hopefully this gaps up overnight again


Bought puts EOD for 19 and 15, literally saved my whole portfolio from my PLTR tank
Sounds like someone doesnt know what riding trends is. Stupid not to ride something up or down even if it doesnt make sense to be where its at.
I mostly track this sub out of morbid curiosity, if youre buying shares youre smart but not really producing the gain/loss porn Im looking for
Yeah SPY options trade for 10 or 15 min AH, i forget which.
Yeah my 2% down doesnt really seem too bad in contrast.
Exactly

Sorry bro :(
Very well said
If I did have a wife I think that would be very likely
Wtf?
I very much disagree
And if youve been paying attention they have been running endless trials and pushing all of their products to the last stages.
hey it's only my life savings it's not the end of the world
PLTR will test the 8D which is around 23-24 and might test the 21d which is around 16-17

Calls will be exploded

Dude round up a bit and its almost 20$ come on
I got 33 expiring the 8th, youll be fine
yea thats what I thought too
Me too
Well I bought in at 18.6 so hopefully you are right
No I was joking. I dont know anything
Itll get there soon.
No of course its not but theres literally no buying at all
I did dumb ass Are you one of those retarded bag holders that bought in on Friday?
I knew I was going to get into some weekly calls and then it was just a waiting game for an entry price. I got lucky with the bottom
Illiterate people
Worry about that later
Haha, I haven't yet been on that website but I've been on the JMIA and it is highly suspect. But retards here actually think that bc it's like Amazon it's worth $3,000 price tag lmao
I had just woken up ok & I saw someone yesterday say just wait, its hitting $20 tomorrow
but they also said to buy at $33
Rule #1 Memes always bounce. HARD!
I almost sold my shares Friday to free up some money for plays this week, glad I waited
PLTR
the stocks that people talk about the the most for the best IV, PLTR lately
same !! but how do you make 60%? usually they're like 200-350 per contract
When AAPL hits $135, I just may.

Yes or no, but definitely maybe
YES PDA

What price are you expecting it to go to? $30?
Yeah, I do.. you do need to have patience tho. Not everything happens overnight
Youre dumb asf if u think youre gonna be rich investing in boomer stonks
I meant $500, my bad
I'm basically running https://stocks.comment.ai since quite some time now and thats where I already crawl all the WSB comments and get bullish/bearish statistics. So for the above I just need to filter the comments by all NYSE/Nasdaq tickers.

For the sentiment model I've been labeling a lot of comments here manually, then I trained a neural network to automate the classification. It's of course never 100% correct but over time it got a lot better with feedback.
Magic
I am 100.0% sure that stocks_comment_ai is not a bot.

Hi Alf!
Morning sex is the best
Aha is a seltzer brand, the flavor is green tea and it has a small bit of caffeine in it.
From the posts Ive read on here, anything under $18 is a buy because shorts have a large position at $18
Lol, but we have to see the same PLTR memes over and over and over. I like PLTR but it's so tired seeing people whore karma off the same shit.

I might be in for more shares today, I think at 600m or 700m after open mkt cap it they are still way undervalued.
Nothing like what it was when it went way up overnight. Every fucking post was GME haha. Its pretty quiet now considering
I dislike the government
Keeping the poor poor
Mods!! Mark it
I second this
Same but never enough gains lol. Used the call I already hit go buy shares.
It's true tho
You sir are a retard . A retard and a hero...
Unless you think the market will tank in general I would say you are fine. I own may calls
Need more details on position
Username checks out
Andrew Left
for sure... so which ones you like.   i got in on amzn dip today and came out 175 on a day trade.  what you buy dips on?
Yeah?! Cant wait to check out my PLTR gains!
$31 EOD
we can only dream eh
Your insider info is that GM is actually going to do a deal with NKLA?
Its up 80 cents from the bottom relax
Nobody knows who you are
I have no pltr but I would like to see someone eat their own shit
true lol. i dont understand these kids could look at the chart for 5 seconds and understand how GME moves, but noooo guess thats too much work
pltr 33>24 
crsr 51>35
I just like that it's named after the crystal ball that shows the past, present and future, and Grima Wormtongue threw at Gandalf from the tower of Orthanc.
Dont have much time left lol
I was assuming you where being sarcastic, but since I cant be sure I'mma drop some wisdom on u. Why the FUCK would you SELL?! If you are shitting your pants after a small dip, GME is NOT for you. GTFO you paper handed little pussy. We are literally fighting hedge funds for a short squeeze and you are crying to your mama because you lost your weekly allowance trying to be a big boy? The stock is up 10% since friday and you start shaking because you bought at todays top? Five days ago it was at 12. Did you think big boys wherent going to try and take your lunch money? If you are getting paper cuts from trading dollar bills, I think it would be better for everyone if you went back to buying lollipops instead of stocks.  


In case you where sarcastic: Well played sir. Well played.
Got 20c for 12/4 lol am toast
Exactly
nice
Rip
Idk man this sub went absolutely ballistic for AAPL during its post-split run-up. And people have forgotten about AAPL since then
Hah good thing we didnt get cucked
people can report it to reddit, but usually nothing happens
not my problem 
Dont get me wrong Im bullish mid to long term but the stonks are just overheated. I made also good money with cyclical stocks when the vaccine was announced. 
Now we see a whole switch in the sentiment, lowest Short interests since ages and most of the good news and events of the upcoming year are already drained in the price.

I think the market will react more to a major negative news as to another positive one. But Im a retard, dont take me serious
im may be gay but not a bear
No clue what to think after today lol it was steadily climbing so I mean this has to happen sometime its inevitable
Puss
I just dont know how I feel about it Im 50/50 I know theyre gonna start distributing the vaccine soon also thats whats keeping me in. This fucker better not permanently dip on me.
YAYY!!! 
Apple, moderna, thicc 
Bruh I have 400 shares and 4 $17c 12/11 covered calls. This is perfect for me
youre such a cuck
For real lol why would anyone do this
Ah man it tore my portfolio in two and I am waiting for it to bottom
It burned me too. I decided to sell it awhile back to reduce my capital gains. I figured it wasn't going to do much before the end of the year.
Ya I got them for cheap when it spiked. But their share lock up ends on the first. Plus they have the GM deal expiration on the 3rd I think. So all bad news for the stock price hopefully.
Loaded the dip Wednesday and it tanked again Friday, so Im down pretty fair amount and would be happy to cut even
Everything that feels bad about a Monday just feels amplified :( 

Back to Monday - Friday grind after a nice long weekend with not another one until Christmas 

I'll be over it by noon once I get back into swing of things tho
Funny thing is it was powered by retard strength for so long. Idek how its still going
Buttfuck it
Thanks, i outta slap myself  for not guessing that one
Frank Sinatra covered the Evangelion Ending Theme?!
Good point. Probably hold til then, dump after.
GM?
Oops forgot the not
I was thinking to unload it once I got close to $160 but also thinking I should grab 60 more shares and ride it up to $200.
Yes I realize this now thanks for captioning my pain. Trying to figure out the cheapest way out of these
I have a good feeling about this
I will need to work on my retardedness to get to that level!
It hasn't been priced in the last 3 weeks.
arent the other 2 bigger than hexo?
Call credit spreads then
Lost 1/5th of my portfolio last week thanks to my PLTR calls on ATH . Gotta be a little cheap till it moons back up.
Yeah I'm gonna call BS or volunteer bias. There's no technological draw, they probably do background checks, and most devs lean lib
Definitely could see them do that for a "drug test"
Clearance disqualifies a huge talent pool
U from Glassdoor m8?
No one wants to work at netflix so...
GM doesnt wanna have anything with NKLA
yea it's pretty much what they are doing

when you short sell a stock you make the ask lower and lower and when people put in market orders they fill the lower price causing a price dive

can especially happen in pm because of such little volume

this is how price fluctuates
Would require a catalyst for that to occur tho. Slow melt up is more likely as stimulus and pandemic resides.
12/18 285 been holding for a month
is mid 2021 long enough?
Dumbass app
Markets did close early on Friday
I think so too. At least the covid crash was quick. Sept one dragged out until end of Oct almost.
F.. I didn't buy yesterday. FML
Im in on that one too..

Currently holding calls in PLTR, GME, ACB
PS5 bundle now comes with 2 doses of  the vaccine. One for you, and another for a friend to play in split screen together on the same 17" TV like god intended while feasting on pizza and mountain dew.
Whens it going before the house
I remember buying at 87 and selling at 79...
Same bro was gonna buy in the 120 range but the bid ask spread was so far at the time I decided not to, so mad
Any particular strike you are looking at?
Thank you
Got some 12/4p and 12/11p last week, just trying to convince myself to not sell yet
The shorts will have less of a pool of shares to re-purchase to cover their short position. Think supply and demand, the supply got smaller.
Folks borrow shares then sell them short.
^^
so should still get in?
Harsh but true
Well I believe two have. Its a put credit spread. So nothing really happens. Although I kinda wish I got assigned...
How much did you drop into it?
This little dip its having here is making me a little nervous. Not gonna lie
Trust this guy, he knows.
What strike and ex?
Never doubt the strength of unchecked autism i guess
Its not moving at all compared to literally every other SPAC
You think it will stay up after the 14th or you selling that day?
Thanks
Oh boy! 
[deleted]
Say no more
Down 16% for me :(
Why would that mean red?
yea i know. but its a lot for me brother :) im still in UNI lul

one day 5 figure swings will be the norm
well just as I was writing you, my limit order 37.05 got executed lol. so I sold.
Little risky yeah but Im banking on it being continuously bought up until inclusion. IV isnt too too high either so I think its reachable by tomorrow. Dunno if Ill hold through a lot of the expiration though
index shot caller. if I do individual stocks I'll specify bro.
Thats a horrible buy
Doesnt the premium go to 0 if it gets bought for lower than 60? Or do the sold calls get converted to sold calls on CRM?
No its acting like I have an option thats losing money slowly
Surely good entry point soon. This stock has burned me so bad though I want to dump as soon as I break even
Thinking about taking my losses on AYRO too man, but its too big of a loss right now. Only saving grace is, the whole market is tanking, so there is slight hope it will recover a little. Good luck with the rest of your positions!
Oh shit, double down or abort
Frustrating, P&D
Damn monday
Sorry mate just got shares

No
Yes it's overblown fear, and that's one reason I like buying China stocks
May you rest soldier. Itll come back done worry.
Cuck
590c/600c spreads hanging on by a thread for me
I'm sorry about that bag you're holding.
Why, does, it, seem, like, premarket, rules, the, day.
No punctuation is going to rescue that abomination 
same brother
Ya just bought more January 15 $25 calls
im looking at major indicies mfer
got in 350 @ 11.93
any news? i cant find anything on google.
it went down 4% in the span of a minute
Totally different accounts for that. Those are up 300% for the year, even today.
Long gone my dude. No one at risk on this ship
Seems odd
See that bounce? That was me.
Gotcha! I'm waiting for right time to buy calls then!
Vaccine news
GME since august
Smart - not sure. Certainly less dumb than the people buying weekly OTM calls for a stock that nearly tripled in two months. 

Enjoy your cat food!
-12 percent today and -18 percent over two days is a dip. Anyones monthly or weekly calls are finished.
Mods just unbanned me but Ill post every night with recaps and next move possibilities and then update SPY 15m before open and last update will be 1:00pm mst. Rinse and repeat.
Just dont be retarded... options fuck u up eventually... Ive been sm happier and gained more just doing shares
cope I held through all the other dips it went below 25 and triggered my stop loss
Lmao I feel at peace now
Oh it was you hahaha I actually checked bro
-7%
Id rather not if I dont have to lol Im using unsettled proceeds but dont think Im committing a free ride violation. Was literally able to buy GME stock no problem but Apple calls gives me an error saying I may be committing a violation if I execute the trade
Nah I sold a share of Tesla today and trying to use it to buy Apple calls. Shouldnt be a freeride but Ally is saying it may result in a violation
Wanted to lower my overall cost of AAL. I think percentage wise... AAL might rise more. But Southwest is a stronger airline. I'm betting on shittier one for higher gains.
Have you been anticipating an 'infinite' short squeeze for those 3 weeks though or just a decent (non spiked) gain?
Im still holding, but didnt buy enough of it to matter much.
:( i lost money
when will it happen though?
squeeeeeeeeeze it up. make me some moolah
Whale alert picked up 10k of $85 calls expiring 12/04

Is the secret word stickied?
Where were you at 9:45am?
Lol
Idk but idc as long as you retards keep telling me about them and I keep making money lol
Pretty good points tbh. I just want nicer graphics and shorter load times :(

Nope

Figured it would drop more and Ill buy back after or find the next meme
Good call, got a two week call at the bottom
maybe he meant pop pop
talking about the real pop not the meme pop
why the 14th?
What happens the 14th?
Please do.
cant help dumbness
Got in at 77$ and its been carrying all me to the 
Already in, IV is way too high to expand position outside of shares.  Sitting on Jan 20s just debating on when to sell.
Not at all, see above.  Back when SPCE was around 20, it would drop like 15% intraday and then end green or flat.  It was like as soon as it broke 20 it went straight to 18.5 then ended the day at like 20.10.
Needed that bro gonna probably swing for tmr and sell

what color lambo you have now? lol
Idk if it will actually boom like that but i think this is the time for an ath with retailers doing poopy but shop and etsy amazon ect having good sales on black friday. Additionally today is cyber monday so they will definitely say something this week about how they did like 3x what they have been doing all year or something if not im still already up.
I got 32c for janurary wbu?
LOL, yeah I gave that guy 5 awards.

oh yes bruv
I doubt it

Thats what I also believe.
Exactly. Its not allowed to go anywhere else. 
Done

Agreed
Eh I still made +120% and helped keep the rest of my portfolio afloat, so I'm happy. Hope it keeps going for everyone else.
It's also an Israeli company, so we're helping the good ~~frogs~~guys!
True should have added Theta as well.
Thanks for explaining, this sucks ass!
Between $450 $500
Yeah I see this making sense. Thanks.
For spot silver $22, for gold 1720-1730 in the next week. Good stimmy news could change that though.
Ty
Literally impossible unless you in rural shithole with government grants or served in the military retard.
I agree lets pump this fucker UP  
Not at all its as simple as believing weed -> up and taking 5x a week
Ive never made so much money smoking all morning as these past couple weeks

Just swapped my Jan $5 call out for shares.
look at 2017-2019 chart
Cut my losses on PLTR fds
Looks like she is in the position to do so
too late?
just rolled uvxy calls back a week lfgggg
lmao like that would stop anyone from motorboating them warlocks.
I'm getting theta cucked hard rn
Already printing lol
Youre flairless you dont get an opinion
You fucking sadist. Enjoy losing money both ways autist
This is spot on. The house vote to delist non-compliant companies is happening this week and it is almost certain to pass. That will be another big catalyst down. I sold all of my CWEB and am waiting for a heavier dip to get back in.
Agreed. Usually if they have to ask, it means sell
200x 12/4 125c. Tripped down during that big dip, kinda paid off
that's actually assuring, means all of china got fucked - why though ?
Idk if its shorts or someone actually selling
Yeah im waiting to see how it moves this week. The merger still hasnt happened so I think it has time to grow
Went with this, lets do this
Went with this as well
Did this as well
True SQ+ETSY
Yeehaw!
Welcome to tendie town!
Already holding, full faith in them, not selling anytime soon
Thats all the validation I needed
Nice. Mind if I ask your position? Or one of them at least lol sounds like you have a few
Do you not see the huge sale its on right now lmao?
But why is that? Is it simply the stigma of being an "old" company? Like PFE is to GM as MRNA is to Tesla? Or since PFE is an established company investors don't see it having tons of upside like relative newcomer Moderna?
I've endured a lot of negativity on this one, on and offline. Still, it made me over $40k along the way. The play is not over, and now we can add CRM to the mix.
Thanks all.
So any time I sell regardless of what I do with the profits is a taxable event. Understood. What if I hold a stock for the last 6 months of the year and it tripled but no sale yet? I dont have to pay taxes on the gains I have not yet realized do I?
GME
Lets see. Im holding till Wednesday tops
You thinking its a false break out? Might be the move tmrw morning. I feel like it will open pretty green though with PJ traders jumping in pre market. Boomers like ohhh my apple 2 was a good computer I think that new company apple may do well in the future.
you son of a bitch im in
the greed is real
i think if it has momentum in power hour im back in
Wouldn't you get better returns in the stock market versus putting it in your house?
Bought 70 shares fingers crossed now!
What you eyeing up?
Think $620 12/4, what about you?
Probably true
*Walmart
not much, made $20 so far on the one call i sold (30c 12/4).
mirror universe ipa and some johnnie walker double black to wash it down
I dont have that kind of money
100x 8c 12/31 APHA. Its going to make me wealthy. Deleting this app and donating 1k to a food pantry if it hits 16 next month
That hinges on people holding shares, on WSB..and youre saying Im an idiot, lol people will sell this off and be onto next weeks meme stock
The entire operation hinges on people holding shares and there was a guy that pump and dumped this morning, people will sell and get bored and be onto roblox or whatever the next meme stock is next week
I have some of those too, still plenty of time for it to run up more, especially through holiday season.
80c
NOW youre onto something. Id pay good money for that
Thank you  I forgot parody is usually protected

He wants Stripe announced on Dec 9th - not gonna happen

That said I am jacked to the tits on PSTH yo
I am.

45% annual return
lol, eh ride the hype for the vote :D. Not investing in ACB. Wait for Blow off top :D
well hence got shares so I don't get cucked by AH or PM fuckery lol
You're focusing on the wrong piece of data.

The important part isn't that PLTR is trading 130 million shares today.

It's that a company with .1% of it's market cap just moved 2 billion.
Lol same. I took the L and moved on with my life. Oh and I probably bought an aapl weekly today
Good luck. Im shares only so horizon isnt that important.
Yeah it was up at like 320 at one point and since then its just died. Im still ahead on the position but feel like I could put the dollar elsewhere. Im also convinced there will be a large selloff so want to trim any positions which dont have strong momentum
Lol that's because your retarded, intel if going nothing but up with it's fat dividend as gravy
which chip do you use?
I feel like my options dont even move relative to the etf price either. spy is much easier to trade
Nice

I dont have the balls lol, but ill buy one just to brag about the gains if it hits
With possibility of extension or not? I read they applied for extension till April?!
isnt the vote on december 3rd to extend it?
Well looking at the dump i thought they stopped making cars or went diesel
So ok to buy the dip then
BY GAWD APPLE IS DEAD.   THAT COMPANY HAS A FAMBLY.
About the best bang for your buck these days tobacco wise
But if Xi tells Ma he isnt allowed to comply tho
Seems like a great play if they dont get delisted
Been in baba putz since Friday 
i regret selling my april calls last week during the first EV dip.  Was already up over 500% and that was when price was just at the mid 9s lol.
They'll keep driving it down during market hours and cover ah, all with little impact on stock price. It'll even happen soon I bet.
Another 5-7% move upwards this week
THC\_B
ticker is banned
thc-b. was a spac lookin for a cannabis company but decided to acquire/ merge with a ev battery maker instead
Fair.. lol THC- B.  THIIIICCC 
wsb autism at it is finest
The FOMO is real, thanks for talking me down.
Yup, and I've been in it since Wednesday
GME doesn't rent movies to people.
Trade in and same transaction sales are gonna be the big revenue driver imo also you know how many clueless parents gonna buy the wrong Xbox s and get the last gen bc MSFT naming scheme sucks
Thc B
$THC
Worst decision ever
The banned ticker T H C B, its a SPAC

So we call it our thicc boi, thicc 
No one, that's the problem :(
Tons. PLTR was a 10 bagger for me and I cashed out on Friday. Made a bunch on NIO and TSLA as well. Pretty much all of the meme stocks are guaranteed money if you get in early and get out early.
Ive made decent returns on every meme here by following the formula, theyre all basically short squeezes in the beginning, so I throw some play money at it, set a sell point, and forget about it. If I dont make 20000%, I dont sweat it. Doubling my money is good enough for me. But Im poor, so my expectations are low.
Lets goooooo 
I was so worried for my calls earlier
Aaand it's red again
i see it down 1.5%
Why not both?
12/4 lol
yup 12/4, I think I fucked up lol. never underestimating IV again
Bought at the fucking apex apparently. Jesus. And the options were already jacked to the tits when I got to them.
Yeah I dont think so.
You grow up and chill out. For the day, it is looking bad, so far.
I'm actually up 2.49k Today :) Still up $500 from Wednesdays close. Also solld my GME Calls for 100% today lmao, can send pics if you want

&#x200B;

EDIT: UP 3.3K actually
you right
I bought last week made some good gains in the morning and rolled it out to further date and higher strike.... up 25% for the day compared to 50 at the open

Sweet, my PLTR and CRSR memeshares better not cuck me. Gonna chill out on stock watching for now lol
CFRA 17 minutes ago
Short extension until April meaning they have most of what they need already lined up.   


They did not ask for the full year extension, very good sign and vol is super high.
yep
The vote is not April, the vote is Dec 3. They have asked for a short extension until April instead of a full year to complete the DA (definitive agreement) which means they are very close to the deal and only need a few months to sign this up.   


Very bullish, not much downside.
It is possible.
I'm up \~24k on Tillman Fertitta's new SPAC
Haha, they make cpu and Gpu

No they arent

I expect there to be a run up to earnings on 15 Jan. If they report any increase in revenue and EPS its going to pop. They are already close to their EPS from last Jan when they were trading at $48. 

Im holding 35/50c leaps spreads, but if you are feeling brave you can get some just ITM February calls and sell right before or after earnings.
OOL, but is something happening on 4/20 weed related?
out of the loop but is something happening on Jan 15? I know there's a vote sometime this week, but not much beyond that.
Short sellers are tripling down and trying to keep the stock price down
I bought shares plus I did 20C call by Dec 4th.. That's my first ever call lol
You have a small pp or what?
So does TSLA
Same. Fed calls at that spot price. Down like 60% rn
When TA goes wrong, been there many times.
Because they dumped ev for weed thats why
What do you think it will do?
Sounds promising
I'll take it thanks
Nah, this feels personal, it's not algos.
That is right
I said that last part out loud and giggled.

confirmed am autist

That would be pretty rad
Damn right.
Exactly but most people, again, do that at 9:30 on the dot lol.
Every share yiu buy is a drop of luck in the WSB fuck it bucket
this is the way
If it opens at 21 Ill nut on my face
CHAD
Narrator: Its what he didnt say which was important
15% my ass i see 10% and that ain't enough

Tell that to my portfolio that is almost entirely supported by apple calls today
I heard PLTR is merging with GME and TSLA
Up 25% this week
Hmmmmmm
Back home from visiting the fam. Your name checks out
No I sold puts For 150% return today on your shit stock 
Are you retarded?
FR this is such big news I cant believe it
Yep thought so - can already see its getting closer to green. At this rate green by open as I said :)
Yessir
Thats what my uncle said while he was smoking the Marie Jane
I dont disagree but that wont stop them from weekly talking about it on the news and how they are close to a deal. Exactly like august up to election. Markets fed off those news pumps and will continue to do so.
Its never not TSLA
Damn straight.
create a spread?
I bought and am holding and have barely cracked a profit. Meanwhile, my much smaller positions elsewhere are performing literally exponentially better
I have 100 shares at 17.58 only. If I sell covered calls at 25 then I wont mind losing those shares
Nope
 : [Excision &amp; Space Laces -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtE0LXR-EC8)  [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtE0LXR-EC8) 3:12 / 4:49     
Strike date please
Why this date and price? Curious cause noob
Asshole its today no shit but he will use the whole week to dump his shares to bagholders like u 

 money is the friend of no one  

Just buy pltr to make it all back
It ends today, as in today is the last day of the lock up. Tomorrow is when they can sell.
Weekly.   But Im starting a longer baba call position today. I think it will moon after Wednesday
Bought 20 then and 40 now 
REST IN HEAVEN
I hope so but last couple of times I fomo I lost money, sticking a new strategy this time around , good luck man get those tendies
Thanks for the DD. Im in!!!
Ok would I have money left over for hooker to
Africa 
sorry. I meant 04.12. end of week
Ironically i was taking a dump
Yes I was pooping
SOULJA BOI UP IN IT OH
lol
The new iFleshlight
AirPods, iPhone 12 (last quarter didn't include them because of delay), iPads. They're selling like crazy
Same here. They pointed out the bottom of SHOP back in March and they were spot on
Theyre share-buyers podcasts mostly, but the Money podcast actually delivers on some solid recommendations. You can take the DD and go with leaps but its mostly a heres what happened in the market and here are some interesting looking tech and boomer plays

Edit: Their Thanksgiving post is always a shitshow but the weekly one is decent
Example of one besides Apple?
Yup the morning dump shook me out of my weeklies that would be up over 100% right now if I held
I love APHA, bought hella calls this morning and my portfolio is up 35% since
Imagine not realizing that hype even if irrational will drive stocks up crazy high in which you can get in and get out before everyone catches up. I know the Senate's position on this stance, still doesn't change the fact that weed stocks will run up till a little before or after the vote.
Indeed. Imagine thinking anything is going to get done the next 4 years. Maybe if daddy Biden gets on his knees for daddy Mitch, the Democrats win Georgia and lobbyists chilling instead of buying senators (with a decisive vote).
Ive caught that fucking knife like 6 times. If it rug pulls I might die.
Yeah dont go long on weekly calls IMO. Go leaps/shares or sell options.
Issokay. We come back
Why dont you share
agreed - inclusion news is going to push it back up.  Expect a new ATH at open tomorrow.
Any chance Tesla could see another red day based on how the announcement goes?
honeywell?
 its a bee
Their last quarter was slightly bigger than the same quarter last year and they didnt even release an iPhone until there was one week left in the quarter, (wayyyy later than usual), and stores were at limited capacity. The current quarter is going to be apples biggest quarter ever due to everyone buying the 5G phone. They will announce earnings for the holiday quarter at the end of January and it will fly around that time.
Just came across what seems like a great deal on this one, 40k miles, 18grand
Damn thats what everyones saying
Someone else told me audis are very reliable as long as the scheduled maintenance is done so idk 
[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-starts-week-3-gain-133430390.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-starts-week-3-gain-133430390.html)
Preach it brotha 
Well see how it goes. A $10B market cap is nothing these days and that would put it around $160/share.
and sold for 70% gainnnn live to scalp another day
Wheres the DD
Bad
Ha! No I held from 401 to almost 500 and took my tendies. Been waiting to jump back in but this might be too much of a gamble even for me. If s&p doesnt confirm tonight its ded by open
Ah you also held after the split. At least one of us learned their lesson. S&P doesnt get confirmed tonight anyone bagholding will get ripped a new one thats for sure
But I really really want to
I mean I make money, Im successful at trading. What else do you want? I really do try to give good advice and every call Ive made so far has been correct. While 80 might be a stretch it will definitely hit over 70 by January for both of them sorry but thems just the facts man. NIO will be minimum 150 in a years Xpeng prolly about the same area. See you then
300 still over valued 100 sounds BeTtEr
Still to early to tell but 2k
Bears were saying it early this morning
Pershing does?
you dont know what you're talking about
They probably too busy trying to find racist companies to fund on parlers version of wsb
Im broke, i started with only 4k that i saved
Probably $100 to $10, mostly brokerage fee
Same
> PSTH

Any news on a merger?
I sure hope 'most' people didn't buy high IV calls or shares when it was up 15%. The reason it's been discussed in this sub is most people have had positions for a while or before today.

If you had shares or calls before open today you're green. I'm more than aware that it's a bummer when it comes down from the highs but if you can't handle that then this isn't for you.

People will buy at the high. People will by calls at high IV. That's a risk they take, but surely for most people today is a net green day.
Makes sense!!!
So you think they tanking?
If it works, it works.
I know but there were SO people saying "going to add more after my next paycheck even though I can't afford it"...maybe I'm becoming an old fruit but I feel bad they got conned.
Already 1500 shares in there
s only jump 
ZM is also a terrible product. There are numerous alternatives to video conferencing. 

And nobody gives a fuck about interns. Half are unpaid anyway.

Pretty sure thats only for government employees or people above a certain age
Oh Im still holding some GME but Im at least 54% pissed about it
I have a guy on the inside. cant leak or i get banned
Considence capital llc
I have a guy on the inside. cant leak or i get banned
I have a guy on the inside. cant leak or i get banned
why?
Yeah it's probably gonna squeeze but the people saying $500-$1000 a share are a bit out of touch.
 fr
Wait...people are actually posting this in a serious light?

Jesus Christ we really are at the top.
GME won't even hit $50
Youre right its gonna be 1000. What a retard
A DD was posted here saying it will hit $500. It got people believing real hard
Give it time, it's only 7am
Nah it's good advice. TBF I been coding weekends and nights getting something done for EOY so I am due some fuck off time (like the rest of the office seems to be permanently engaged in). I am bad at figuring out how long its gonna take me to do something, obsess over it, and then come in way ahead of schedule. It's not optimum, but it keeps me in business.
What do you think about BP leap?
IV waaaaaay too high.
01/21 $180C I got in around $2 per contract.  I saw some cuck on Twitter buy 5,000 $190C contracts and thought I try a milder flavor.
got a 12/18 22.5c and 30c. Trying to decide when to take profit since SPAC's fall-off after merger sometimes.
Why?
Do not buy JMIA lol, what on earth is appealing about African amazon? Nearly half of everything gets returned and their YOY is negative
Shares. Its a penny stock turning into a mid stock.
Literally still pre market. MM and shorts will try to shake as hard as they can.
STRIKE AND EXP?
Cost basis? I keep seeing institutional adding making an announcement soon likely
Maybe some puts at open
Could you explain it? Ya know, for that guy.
Thats what Im thinking...  open it and sell when it touches $20 again like it did this morning.  
I read this as absolutely open them, right?
Yea I dont know whether to pump money into it at open and get out at eod, but if its not hitting 50 at least, not sure its worth the FOMO
Max OTM
Stupid bot, ya Lapeer MI is the definition of rich 
Bot, this is a Wendy's.
Someone likes to lose money. Charles Dow will haunt your dreams young buck.
Dont forget sideways 

7.5c 12/18 could possibly print
What happens in April?
Its a word in the dictionary.
Im down
So you're saying stonks only go up
my 70 year old dad told me about it.

he then asked if I was invested in PLTR
oh ok, it's the same squeeze hype then. I held when it was dipping to 11 and the entire sub was so quiet a month ago.
There is good leverage on the coin. How good is their SaaS business, why are they valued at only 3-4x sales when everyone else is at 30-40x? 

&#x200B;

Seems like there is opportunity on both parts of the company.
Actually 160million shares are available to sell tomorrow via unlock
Gotcha appreciate it
Stock Moe
Damn. Will have to go to r/stocks or r/investing now

Oh man I feel you on that. I think the deal is finalizing. Before was just talk
Thank you
You right gonna hold so I dont have to pay tax on pltr for now
Wow, might add more holy shit. Thanks brother
unless you're one of those motherless fucks at Citron
I bought a put for 8$ just in case
im holding january puts. hoping for sub 10 by end of december
Its happening indeed.
oh it's coming back up lol time to buy more at 18.90
Alright fuck it. These premiums are bananas though.
but they finally climbed a little back up again. Its a good sign
Im just holding it till q4 earnings come out and then im gonna sell it 
really doesnt look like appl is growing at all failing to break out ATH
got you bro
Scared money don't make money 
Good for you
Can you now? I still cannot ffs
Thats what I thought but every time it seems to knock the stock down. Stupid.
Have some 15 Jan '21 40c PFE....those are being very nice to me right now. Also have some shares of PFE to boot.

damn really? this is like the 5th monday in a row with positive vaccine news and the market still doesn't want to pump any higher.. we need a little bit of a sell of here to get back to healthier levels. everything except small cap is oversold
At least in Germany. May be due too many orders
X2
microvast, the thickest and GIK, maybe Hcock
Jeeeez, you have really high hopes my guy
RIP, i have some 1/15 $20c so I think Im just gonna hold but it feels bad having that money tied up
Just did 
Nice
Im only green cuz Im balls deep in AAPL LEAPS but other than that Im getting dicked
bunch of pussys. im staying. maybe this will fix the IV
So, tomorrow I'm thinking..
Yea same tbh, Ill wait eow to see if Ill buy more
I do...meant get to 100 by avging down cock lips
Has there been news for the other SPACs mooning (GM HI , APX T)
What happens if an outage leads to you losing the money or an auto order not fulfilling?

Do IBKR have a policy of compensating?

Never seen this before from IBKR, I thought it was just meme apps like Robinhood? How often does this happen with IBKR?
Tech stocks are down too?
lmao, not that big.
When holding weeklies not the easiest but agree
Lol rip. I've been cautious because opec is opec. Never a full day there
Yes
I would have killed to work there and just say I want equity componensation

Take a 50% paycut
Word. Most of my calls are at least a couple weeks out if not 2021. I did miss the exit on my PLTR weekly though.
They were two different contracts

Hopefully it goes up. Ive been holding for a while and there hasnt been much movement until today.
I mean I got 600 dollars so alright. Plus Im selling CSP retard
No idea how it's going to go. I'm from the UK 
thanks for the help boys, bought in at $35
Im doing overal market rn

Spy
Nah I look for more short term ride the meme momentum
No I sold PLTR and am done with it for the time being
I feel personally attacked.
Alright what did I miss???!
"covid relief package" may get some get token graft pack for departing senators. stimmulus is ded tho till jan.
Wish someone told me that before I panic sold 
Lost a lot of profit when it just jumped off this cliff, wtf is that lol. Debating if i wanna hold or sell while Im up
Nah please dont say that :(
I mean, I have a lot of room to drop before Im worried, so my diamond handing isnt a hard choice! Hopefully you and a lot of people have the same luxury
Yup, I have an average of $17 so Im not too worried right now. I paper handed NIO when it was under $20 for a small profit, Im not going to make that same mistake again.
Hedge funds hire the bank i work for to do the operations/clerical bull shit they dont want to deal with
Godspeed friend
I just picked up 210 calls for 12/11. Im gonna grab more at the end of the day. I decided to go farther out to give me more room in case the drop continues
GME is a pump and dump and Ive missed the pump 

PLTR triggered my stop loss when it hit 25 lmao
I was just waiting for the paradox fandom to burst into this sub. You have to have an extra chromosome to be one of us.
Yeah this one is on my list to watch..too many SPACs in my radar currently. Seeing if I'll drop a bunch into shitcorn in the next month then cycle into Alts when dominance hits around 15% to rotate into the alt growth phase.
Anything really
Ok thanks Ill check that one out
Hi Taylor
Getting repetitive with the rivalries
They're painful, I don't know what to do.
Also, high volume sell off- low volume rally. Look out, people.
Honestly, it worries me, but the price is right. ROKU isnt betting as heavily on hardware while theyve outfoxed CMCSA to the point that they own something like 1/3 of a fragmented market. There is upside potential, but Id be way, way more worried if AAPL or AMZN  with experience in creating DTC products to download and experience in good UI  actually got their shit together and really challenged them. 

Im thinking this is my SHOP play to AMZN, taking a different route to challenge the kingmakers with high risk and high reward
I know I want to short it now here too but it's like playing with fire with that shit stock.
That's why i'm holding off on jumping in. Q3 is going to be a slaughter.
[deleted]
Infinite pump!
LMAO nah allusive bro
Nice. Tough choice I bought shares sold off some now have stop loss order in place in case deal falls through
Youre my hero
Are the units generally preferable? Or how do you decide?  Where can you see the details of the Warrants. 

Sorry I know these are noob questions.
Such as...
Use losses? What does that even mean bro
gud luk mon
Thanks bro! I appreciate it, I am going to inverse your play and if I make gains, you know I am gonna give back!
Hey if you end up being right and it goes down a lot, I got you
Thanks, appreciate the input
How about now? I am green now just because of CRSR
I think institutions took advantage of retail investors by using order data to identify when retail pump was slowing down, sold at the top, then to buy back later once retail panic sells.
Ooof I fell for that one back in May 
Damn. Hold for sure
Fuuuuukd sorry bro
That fucking slut rarely moves
With all the pumpers in here you're prob right there
Msft is a whore
Nope, if you had those or KNDI Puts you killed it today.
Nice! Shes been a sideways wreck for a while but a lot of call sweeps coming in and I like the price action today
Lockup expires today, but they can't sell until tomorrow.  Media has it wrong. This is an opportunity
Lockup
jan 21, what do u think?
He's talking tommorow? Easy puts literally works Everytime
Was about to buy 69 spy calls at 420
You know what they say, if you cant beat them, join them lol.

But I seriously think tech is gonna go on a bull run pretty soon, lots of bullish activity for options in the next quarter on FANGMAN
Literally can't go tits up at least until it merges
To sell the vaccine news at its peak mainly. Especially if the fda approves anything on the 10th
Indubitably
.... FULL
Yeah. Hopefully!!
I got 32c on same day. This better moon
I think they're saying its too little too late for these companies, even the big boys. Technology is trending against them as it is, and now their balance sheets are all sorts of fucked up. This cheap saudi oil is going to continue until they diversify, and the US is required to take their exports due to contractual obligations. US oil is turbo fucked, especially shale.

Calls on PLTR + NIO - both green by close, SPY already coming back :) Bounced so hard had a rocket under it
The dog is really a shape shifted Kamala Harris
True teams is killing them and CRM cant package and sell slack with its products that easily.
Well it got an upgrade today from hold to buy thats why its up, I dont see this holding though especially if the overall market goes down it will drag it with it
I'm an idiot and bought puts at 20.66, now up a dollar. Hope I didn't fuck up on a dec 4th 20p
Winner. Winner.
Chicken dinner.
yea im on the fence, whisper is 0.99, but guidance will be the critical thing this time around i figure...perfection + needed to sustain this price
650+ P/E  and you figure +29% this week. WOW, thats crazeee! Hope it goes well for you. If it can happen anytime, it is now, or 1999
This is a casino. Do it fgt
Earnings tmr in pre market, some big funds are holding MOMO so its a yolo play

merci bocoo
yes but I have large money, need return between plays
Hopefully Tesla hits 565 by Friday
But if I buy a pit contact for 2k Tesla 565 12/4 the most I can lose it that right. If so thats fine
I have some energy etfs already and probably too much exposure to VOO. Maybe JETS then.
Whats your thoughts on why you are holding back. Not too much information out there on this company
Yes
I bought calls a month ago and theyre finally moving. Up 150% today
Yep
Why is it such a given that it wont pass the senate? Why wont they pass it
So you think once vaccine news comes out its gonna moon?
What makes you think so
All US companies are OTC, but yeah I like Trulieve as a company.  Established and profitable.  Shame no options though and its already run up quite a bit.
Its trading at a low price, around $5 or so bucks so still think it has a lot of growth opportunity. Keep an eye your on stocks in that industry though. More people are turning to plant based meat and companies are giving contracts to those who can isolate protein from peas, soys etc. Similar to the EV market its one that will continually do well over the next 10 years
Great play I agree
I'm just bored, why else? Nikola definitely has dip buyers keeping it above 20 clearly.

Hmm...Im gonna hold my shares in that case. TSLA hasnt let me down yet.
I bought at 0.06 on like Wed lmfao
What strike and date
What strike and call
I bought at the top of the rally. Hope I didnt fuck myself
What the hell even caused that massive drop from last week?
What's your feel on it?  130s?
S&P would not be the ones announcing more shares being offered...
You dont think theres a major demand for recreational travel?
I want him to die to
Why?
I grabbed $90 1/15 calls and am up 60%. Feeling anxious
I like this strat and will do something very similar.
lol the whole thing was so cringe
You da MVP
yea i got 20 fds on a 50 dollar run up and made 40k, but have lost it all since hahah

TSLA and SpaceX have easier visibility on its path to the moon...?
True. Ive lost a quarter of my portfolio and shrugged but whenever I miss out on a 10 bagger cause I sold early I cant help but feel pain
It is for my feelings
I like your take. Thx!
magic coin market cap is like 2% of gold's, doesn't really explain why gold is stalling right now
Why not?
I did a $280 calendar spread this morning. Looking good.
yeah i think so, its not official official yet until 5:15pm
Lol I meant to say calls I had a temporary brain smoothening
Oh Im in, just cant find any specific time or date
You are correct, sir. Was making a snide reference at how that dog never rolls over, but Im happy any time these RKT bags Im holding get a bit lighter.
i have 3 reasons

1. the chart is looking HORNY

2. They may prerelease the record breaking and/or unexpectedly great sales for blackfriday/cyber monday

3. They've been quiet since the RX announcement (which didn't bump it enough). More news is coming.
I rode them all the way up and back down again, its been pretty demoralising
The same reason we didn't wake up +1% after news of vaccines being put on literal planes for distro.
Right, had them queued up and just got busy and couldn't check. Not really RH's fault, but I'm going to blame them anyway.
Whys it down in CM during a pandemic?
Friday
Thank you for this
i see $48 mil with a 4:1 C/P ratio
Bruh if you jinx me on this

My heart cant take another 10k dip
Im pretty sure its going to drop $3-4 overnight.

But its like one of those things thats so obvious that it prolly wont happen for a few days
They literally got the worst news they could possibly think of except bankruptcy. That will come soon. Fucking dog shit company. Puts gonna print....
Been dumping for a while
prob a few 60 ones and Im hoping so
Why tomorrow

This morning I accidentally sold 32c when I was trying to buy. Worked out great so far but it got me thinking about easy money throughout the year just by selling the furthest call they have available for the week. My only concern is obviously the market is wild and so is pltr so its not completely out of crazy to think we could see a 30% week but also I think after this run up that it will slow down
Facts less stress but also dont wanna miss the train of after hour actions
For real
So thoughts on how split/ratio could affect price?
What about the investigation from weisslaw??
\*except when you over-leverage like me\*
JNUG probably fucked your account
Bought 3 12/4 364$ c LETS GET IT
I KNOW JPOW GONNA FUCK BEAR ASS 
hope u still think the same ahahahaha
My poots
SPY will be green by close - everything including tech is ripping higher erasing any losses this morning
What do you think it will run up to before then?
Short Squeeze? Got shares to squeeze this MOFO to 20s lol
well bought in around this price... want it to go up!
YES... can pump more, jesus get off WSB
Totally agree. I don't understand an all SPAC strategy. I park some of my money in SPACs because it makes me feel comfortable about the riskier shit I do with the rest of my money.
Apple bro thats easy
MOONNNMN
Its worth $420 bro
Worth $420 bro
imagine the market is this irrational, but maybe
Why? Lol
So do you have a pretty sizeable dick or.. trying to do my due diligence on SOL over here.
Thanks for the heads-up, news I was looking for came out earlier today, not tomorrow.
Already in
nope credit spread..
Ill hold into tomorrow, but probably switch to puts either tomorrow or Wednesday. Its gone up too much to not go down after earnings.
Up we go
Purely gambling eh
Wish I sold 5 min ago lol
Calls
Its set up really well. Look at the last 3 earnings. Big leaps up. Their earnings are dec. 16th and it'll be moving up anyway. With the news I expect them to position themselves quite nicely.
i thought that was for black friday. wondering how quickly we test ATH. I've read a lot of 1200 test.
Why
squeeeeeze?
I bought at the  dip at 20C
I have heard that, though a lategame change like this would be illegal for the S&P
4/16 24c. Not the sexiest play but Im confident in it
Yup. Not doubting it at all
now this is what I like to hear
Wat about the possible delist news?
1. Already achieved.
2. Say no more. All in on APHA.
Yeah looks like I had $96 calls exp 11/27 I sold way too early. Miss timed yet another one.
10 dividend paid for anyone with the stock before December  2
I meant calls, I sold 5 min after open
This week and the whole month
A solid company in a rapidly growing industry with strong cash flows, growing sales, and a clean balance sheet with a management who are making acquisitions to continue to grow into related markets using all the cash from the IPO.

Today was the 3rd and last day of profit taking, Corsair had an amazing Black Friday weekend and probably even better Cyber Monday. This thing is going to jump like crazy this week.

https://inthemoneystocks.com/investors-profit-by-learning-the-three-day-rule/

Profit taking and bad news drops usually come in 3 day windows.
Yeap - You got it.  I'm with you, not worried.
Just wait until tomorrow - people will hate they sold.
Bought 10 12/4 19.5p for nkla. Let's see what happens
Puts?
I thought my chart was glitching
Nice. It dropped off immediately after hours but hopefully thats just low volume nonsense.
wait have the numbers come in? I'm skeptical on YoY. Think a lot people got their shopping in on friday already
30% on MRNA, 70% on BNTX. Both have low float. The whole world is suffering from Covid-19. These 2 companies have a 90%+ effective vaccine coming out. This is ground breaking.
Shares, im not that autistic lol
AYYY LMAO
Im doing great considering my cost basis is $15.07/share
Lmao, hs...
He doesn't need to and probably is not able to.
rolling rock pls
Bagholder cope in the wild right here
Buying leveraged 3x Tesla. Pltr is boring yoo
Yes
Im going all in
I went all in at 18.4
No he didnt. He shorted on Friday which is why it shows his company as institutional owner when they borrow shares to sell. Are you new to this game?
Lol with PLTR? I was short FD calls and like 20 shares

Closed now
Damn. Wish I had thought of that
Imagine thinking they're not an issue for the overall market - where like 1% own  80% of shares... ffs
Who moves the market tho? 
Ban my cock
Can we still say magical internet coins?
What if I want to shit on it hence the name, tf
I see the pun you did there
I have believe me.
Youre not the usual pumper here. You didnt just get in on Fridays high pumping 40s 40s hold hold lmfao

Congrats on the moves made
Precisely lmao
Gay* bears
At what price??
Bro Im already down 3.50
Move on lol once you buy puts it will randomly start pulling up
Started off local but thanks to all the haters I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
I'm sorry for your bags
Hey, PLTR is still my bae but just not this week, we're taking a break and seeing where our relationship is after a week.
I know but I bought at +13% lol
18.17
FUCK IT IM IN 
Good looks bro this sub is my only source of serotonin
If I may recommend peeping NVAX, realist PT of 221 by EOY if everything stays a course
Laugh all you want Ill see you on NIO day. You saw what xpeng did on some stupid little news right? Well we got catalysts incoming
Its dumping boy
delayed inclusion to spy
holy shit lmao, this is so hilariously true. ITS THE FUCKING WEEKEND BRENDA
Shes a woman and a ethnic minority so, definitely lol
Nah you're safe if you stay out. I'm in so it'll dump
And theyre right.
Checks out
Yes
Ight ill play apex then. Itll either moon or crash in the early hours.
$APHA 
Tamaguchi bout to 
This confirms my suspicion
GM and Nikola finally progressed with their partnership with an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) and in that MOU GM is NOT taking a stake in the company.

Why partner with someone and not take stake? 

PUTS ON NKLA once again.
if i can make a quick buck this week, ill get out real quick. if not, ill simply hold.
Are others (e.g AP XT) mooning with news? I havent heard anything
Whos the clown now?
Dont? Or do? Lol
you right
guys chill I rebought on the dip were still in this hoe
lol u must be new
Ill take slight red today for fat green tomorrow.
I went on a wild ride with PLTR from $10 to $30, sorta panic sold on Friday and I guess I'm glad I did. thinking about getting back in
Look at the options. Both calls and puts are negative.
24
Gone lol... maybe a little too early but fuck it money is money...
lol enjoy
Believe me Im looking at it
I couldnt resist. Locked in a pair of 24c 12/31
Autism
Thanks
Mad. lol
Idea: I might be gay but there is no way I am that smart...
Good point.  Thanks.
[deleted]
I dont sell. I bought a put.
Im honored
I went balls deep into VXX calls this morning. 120 at $18.50 12/4
Thats prolly why they Hibernate...
Hi drake lol
Sounds like fun dial.
Those MF need to hurry. My shit expires 12-20
Me neither. Was thinking more because of the inauguration coming up
And what paranoid feelings are those? Enlighten me.
I just expected a bigger jump I guess. Record sales all year, ammo out of stock everywhere and with Biden coming in. Just seemed like a no brainer ha but maybe not.
I didnt mean about all the craziness now. I just meant because of the new admin
This is the real answer. 
DEEZ NUTS! 
Deez contracts gonna print
options are betta den shares
Bought all around 27, one of them last week and 4 more today
Red right now, I bought one last Monday and a few more this morning. Entry at roughly 27 for all of them
Been holding apr 21 3$c for like 3 months now
that's why i'm saying they released the news today so it's worth less.  25% less as of now. might fall even more by tomorrow.
Reported for missing the opportunity of reporting me for self promotion
Awesome, thanks man
We dont speak his name here anymore
He wants another pee pee touch
i know, its the gayest thing ever
Good call preferably pink
Yeah the hemi sounds way better than the 2.0t too
I like the audis but Ive never heard Audi and reliable used in the same sentence
Lmao Im gonna have to do some serious yoloing to get the cash
I like it but arent audis unreliable and expensive?
I said no subis, ugly imo and headgasket problems
I understand that... but would they announce its happening/beginning tomorrow?
Thanks dog
Why would it dip on decriminalization?
Yep... silly tards
please? it's tasty i promise
Its up 250% today tho?
Probably software in the bay
I'm voting software development engineer
Software is my guess
tbh im baghold PLTR calls on friday open then sold those at bottom today.  

just bought 27c on the up to slightly offset. Im gonna wipe if Im not up 2%+ tmrw
I mean that's an entry-level engineer in the bay area. It all depends on where you live.
OP just came to flex and dip lmao
Probably a software guy, but an associate attorney at a mid-size law firm in a decent city can make about $110-$140k a year.
Hes probably in software development, but a mid-law associate attorney in a decent size city draws about that much as a salary. But student loans would reduce savings.
r/iamverysmart
More so its insane how expensive houses are on the coasts.  The prices on the coasts are inflated, the prices on housing in flyover is normal.
80k is the pay cap for most jobs
Going to move after COVID is over. Not like it matters where you live right now
And it's all gone lmao

Leave my boy alone bruh u mad  
Ask again Later
Probably end of week for sure but at this point anything is possible
Are you swinging ?
My 33c is really dicey
-0.81% is crashed?
Well good because honestly wasn't sure if there was support or not.  Steeled myself for 1500 just in case for my smallish position.
that will penetrate my ass
For gay bears when stonks go up
Not when its globally legal, 5 years tops.
I guess turning 2k-20k on an obvious run is bad lol
thank you, but I prefer it my way
You seem fun
They cant afford to live there
Don't tell me what to do.
Only the Rothschilds know
Cause U know everything....We'll see.
Like I said..I'll say no more
It will crash the stock till the threat is gone, its a risk, not news what you price in.
Youre such a fan, its comical
Yes maam
Fair enough. I read an article about people sitting in line in their cars for a food bank in TX to get like $30 worth of food. Kinda seems to me like wasting time and gas sitting in line makes the same sense as going to work far away though. Probably a limited situation tho and thats why it made the news.
I agree with that analysis but I kind of have a problem with people not going to work below their pay grade and expecting unemployment instead. I know thats how advanced societies work but seems kinda wrong to me
Yeah thats kinda what I thought, just trying to get some arguments against this idea to see if that thought process is flawed
I doubt a physicist got laid off, its 90% service workers from data Ive seen. Fair point though, I guess I just have a problem with expecting to collect unemployment instead of taking a lower paying job. Im from Detroit and thats what everyone here did in 2008 to get by.
Where are you from? In MI we have help wanted signs everywhere for a lot of food/manufacturing jobs
Yeah unfortunately everyone plays keeping up with the joneses here. Around here Im a slub for taking a scholarship to go to a state school and coming out debt free versus going to a fancy school and taking on mega debt. 

Kinda rubs me the wrong way when a lot of these same people now want unemployment so they dont have to take a low pay job. Trying to see their side of it though which is why I asked.
damn bro did i say if it was getting integrated or not? we already knew this 
yea it is. after 5pm i think
yea well thats true, but today ah they are announcing how they will do the buy, always has been buy on the day (this time Dec 21) but given the size of the buy they are looking at splitting it for the first time ever I believe....
im better than you because i blindly trust idiots on the internet
lol at you going broke because you're an idiot, enjoy poverty!
Whats the reason
Is this whole subreddit an agreed troll to screw newcomers to the subreddit out of money? Is the code to WSB just to invert everything?
How do you find these early?
Your not my real dad!
Can't play with his dogs without getting hurt. 

Christ.
Aren't we all retarded, I'm just trying to follow the few who were making millions by jumping on the train. I was about to get in on GME because I saw a few big gains but it went up so fast
This is the way
Wouldn't be WSB if it wasn't
I don't think I will get approved bro...
You don't think it will go green?
That seems to be how most of the retards here make a lot of money so yes lol... I only saw one guy with shares and he has 2 million dollars which I don't
AMD, AAPL u fuk
They are going to announce a dividend $20 and a Tesla.
They are paying everyone tendies
Eggs hate this one secret!
And heres the thing.  Eggs dont even need refrigeration!
It's true...i've tried it...works every-time 100%
I ran out you fuck. I had some last night.
Damn. That sucks. Now that I think about it one of my favorite college late night bars is probably closing early every night. Fawkkk. Sad to see.
GME.
I should've had more confidence, my only position is a couple covered puts.
My positions 3x 25p sells 12/18. Ez $
This is the way.
Sorry to hear you missed out bby
More than one.
Big Clit Energy right here
Are you playing it?
PSTH being discussed on r/wallstreetbets
Why?
Cause of the vote?
Better wait for 10 for dip though?
Thats what I figured.
I got 9c and 10c orders too. Didnt think the 8c will fill.
Its going to open higher. Already above $8 premarket. Any downside to just leaving the order in the que to see if it fills?
Will this week
DOCU = internet explorer or AOL

Widely used Doesnt make it good
lool oh no. I bought 3 weekly contracts today in the morning. They were like 30% off. Im in the money.Sitting in gains, just need the stock to go up like a few cents over the week.
has been in the 75-88 channel for four months
[deleted]
Or I could just invest my life savings into Tesla
It hit it before. Im thinking that same thing. 50 In a year?
Buy more obvs
It was a 30p but I closed it cuz paper hands and did not want to hold PLTR. Made my profits on my calls and dipped outta there
Ima need more then jus a yes
Nou? Ik ben al mijn profit 'kwijt', fuck it ik ga gewoon holden. Wat gebruik jij om te traden?
Nice! Paying off today I'm assuming??
I can't, its financed
I always feel that way
youll see
At least my feet are big so I'll take it
And thats how u go broke
$13-15, $17-20 for leaps. For this Friday
Care to share why you think spacs will be hit this week?
From -50% to +20%. Gonna be an easy 10 bagger
How is your PS5 old?! Also, I would connect your system to your TV directly, not to the PS5
Dump on salesforce I mean
I think so. So what changed ? Citron ?
Cant go wrong with it
Lmao gtfo
Yes its fun to dial your friends
Which brokerage you using? Plenty offer at least for share plays
Say it aint so 
dial
Why though.
Are we sure?
What is happening now
What are calls?
Awwwww skeet skeet motha fuckaaaa awwww skeet skeet goddamn
Shares or calls?
Europoors always end up red/dump
but maybe thats how you get a vaccine too
Dropped 3k into 125c FDs. Up 50%, lets goo
What if forbidden internet money hits ATH
This advice here. Unless the ticker is $M or something
It really might hit $700 fuck
Depends on how much it runs up. I'm thinking I'll sell half of my calls a day or two before earnings and lock in some gains, and hold the rest through. That way my gains will cover my potential losses, and if GME moons I still make out pretty handsomely. Might only hold 25% of my positions through earnings depending on what the run up looks like. Playing it by ear.
What is this?  An old with ban flair?
Lmao all they do is put their program in TVs/boxes and somehow they're STILL losing money
Its not about whether its happening or not its the sequence in how its occurring
Im just saying 18 is super bullish
Imagine thinking that was the point and not that there's no support above those tops 

Enjoy your $2 per share
Is that a yes or no random WSB'r? I require confirmation bias
Calls or puts
WSB mixing it up. Love it
He included all the numbers necessary to figure that out
10 calls. Average price of $6.28. $35 strike.
Yeah all the shiet coins are doing well so I figured RIOT was the play
I too sold at open. Down 3k but apple made it up to me. Buying puts on that shit ass stock.
Baghold nvda untill 535, cry over amd gains
Good bot
Yep still overpriced
I would lose 2k I just chucked into puts
Likely yep

Past week daily lows are 0940,1000, and 1140. What is your take of the low to load up today?
PLTR will definitely print a lot more than gme
With Tesla, downward movement like that will cheapen the premiums a bit. IV is ~100%.
Bc a 590 dip has retard strength to go back up to 600.. at 600 we can't tell where it wants to go. When in doubt, BUY
Launch me into the sun
Sorry! I only asked because mine didn't trigger at premarket. I had to cancel my order and just do it again, but they went through this time.
Appreciate it. I knew they didn't do options, but I've never tried to do shares outside of regular hours. Thanks!
Never really mess with shares so might give that a shot honestly. Options just too crazy with it rn for my taste.
I suppose. I got a few shares of it but no way do I trust options for it rn. Thats what I meant.
So what you are saying is, calls on PLTR cause the government knows?
+$350 bitch
12/4 is high theta, 8 went with 12/31
Of course it is but this paper handed ass sub will never pay attention long enough for that to occur
Bro, that's illegal or some shit.
Now. But early hours it dropped by  $24

Go pump your shit penny stocks on r/pennystocks, loser.
There is a fee to exercise an option is well. So its cheaper to just sell the option.

I have 5c 12/18 that i bought during thanksgiving correction last week

i'm a retard but you don't know shit about gamestop
I went into today's open with 3,500 shares and now i'm 5,000 shares with 150 call options lol. I will be strong for another day but I bought at the top so yeah I'm a retard
People playing now are in the short term, 1-2 week range. Anyone up your percentage got in early. 

Most people did not get in early.
Got some on Friday morning, but the IV is so high I refuse to take a big position.

The ones I have are printing tho
I agree, and I think shares are a good play. Just ignore the volatility and hold. I personally won't invest because I really hate the company and what they represent, and I just don't like long-term investing in companies I dislike. But I do think it's a good play. 


It's the people spamming how calls are free money that are being ridiculous.

I was a PM bro for a while, but the movements just seem so unnatural I don't understand why you'd invest in that unless you have physical PM.
Too exposed to the dollar.
I do have like 2 of my three thousand in aapl right now, you think I should sell some or keep?
Same but you gotta eat those butts as well
Son?
Thanks  papa.
Its ran too hot you think its ok? Lol. Idk why Im asking a stranger this bht yolo Im intrigued.
Because I need it to
3d printing.... I did no dd... I just follow blindly.... Still up nicely overall
Nah i was before last earnings but i got shook out before hand with a small profit. This run seems like it was mainly shorts covering, but i am also aware of citron 100pt. So, maybe smol pull back in the immediate futute? Just trying to learn to identify short squeezes and what not. Had 35% short as of last time data released so i will be curious where it is now
Teslas first name (not sure if I can use the ticker here) lol
I mean options are great and all, but i dont want to bankrupt my family and make my kids homeless, so really just looking for some visual examples of how to use technicals and analyze fundamentals.
Smartrader plays options and always provides solid plays
Why 1030? Trying to get in?
Im banking on the pop from announcement, might take this chance at a dip to get some we'll see how low it gets if it drops. Looks like probably dropping on Moderna news.
That sucks. Still, gains are gains. 

Sold ZM at 120 because, and I quote, that was the top
Ok, clean energy then.
Damn bro now we talking
So like donating money from the gains of the short sellers of pltr?
I did. Thank you!
I sold for a 4k profit and bought 2k in ETFs. Going to wait for a midday dip to buy in some Jan calls. I agree with you in that we will see more bumps as the vaccine gets approved for EUA and actually rolled out.
I sold calls as well, 4 X 32C

200$ a pop, yum
If it needs to get amputated - SPY 500 EOY
It could, Ill just set a stop loss and ride the wave
Up another 20% pre market
That's what I was thinking. Thanks nonetheless.
Fuck me I got March 21 calls.
50/50 imo, definiely wont pass the senate, but the news is barely being talked about and weed stocks already pumping
Im in CST so not that early
Im a gay bear rn too so lets hope this shit works out
thanks. my CGC covered call is ITM so my shares are gonna get called away and i'll use those funds to wheel back in. gonna check out APHA
thanks. my long CGC position is going to get called away 1/15 expiration. are there any long cannabis positions you like?
on WSB. Guess I can't trust them
I'd like to buy companies that won't go bankrupt before I'm 60.
what about ARKF? That's got SQ in it.
Im expecting some correction before the end of the month as people book profits before new admin. Im wondering if that could be the catalyst.
I see. What about 60 lol
Its going decent so far
it is dead, also, shady ex CEO shit behind the company. I was lucky enough to have caught the moment and short it. Nice bucks and I closed it. Not bad.
link? i tried to find it.
Same here. I keep doubling down but its catching a falling . Its eating away at my tendies
AMEN!
What is the house voting on?
BABA leaps for after earnings. IV is relatively low and this may be the bottom moving forward.
It's up 10% in the last week fool
nice one thanks
already got in at 15$ way back then
IM THE SPACMAN!
calls on CAKE

thanks but not touching the wacko tobacco again :(
Should've trusted my gut feeling at start!
Well selling before they went OTM was kinda not gay imo but I agree fuc gay bears in their loose furry holes.
These are some legit pep talks
Still could pump when it finally joins the 500. I read an estimate at 12-13%. Possible we already got it, but supposedly the major funds are going to have to rebalance when it hits the list.
I didnt sell I went up like 80% on a postion and made more then it said I did on the day. I only own that and ford which also made me money today. But on my chart it says Im only up like 1/2 of what I should be and the graph is red because from pre market it said I was down 3% overall even though all I have is options
The cnbc article said:

The companies said they continue to discuss GM potentially supplying Nikola with battery systems for its planned electric semi-trucks

So that part of the deal wasnt even worked out
Buy on drop
I have been doing it the last 2 weeks. Up 40% on the portfolio. Shhhhh dont tell anyone.
if you're in the USA, you're shit outta luck. this shit is too degenerate for the SEC

Im in the USA too though. but I made my IBKR account when I was still living in the EU, aka before I immigrated to the US. they still think Im in the EU tho lmao, and they let me do all kinds of shit
On the same 
Held like a dummy & expires next friday 
Just a bitch move on my part keeps happening

I keep going for the small scraps cause I have been scarred before from big positions 

Ugh dont know how I can get past this mentally
$45M per store eh? Check out my past posts, it's pretty much got every red flag you can ask for... like NKLA, but in the weed space
It's 2 weeks out from earnings, it's not done yet
Just look at the chart.  Time for a pullback.
Itll bounce from $20 to $25 almost for sure today/coming days. Once that bounce is over..... probably rip city. Calls into puts.
right with ya
Not touching NKLA soz
I will never sell these. 200 shares each. If it goes to 0 it goes to 0
Wonder waff
That only shows me the current prices?
I just listen to ARKK and Cathie. She bought a million shares. I buy some too. Simple.
Man, I miss them but enjoyed taking assigned share profits at $52.50 last week.
Bought what I thought was that dip only to realize my day trades hadnt reset yet. So got stuck holding.
Something that's 45+ days to expiry, ATM or slightly ITM, meaning I'm bullish

Example 20p 2021 expiry
This past week ya cuck
InstaThot who has been posting about PLTR on her story - should have known the end was near when I saw that fake big booty hoe shilling it.
Oh, definitely. I'm pretty numb to financial loss at this point thanks to this season.
Had calls, but thanks 
At open these puts where worth $2-3 now its worth like $15 lol

The $3570 are worth $2.50 right now 

Easy double coming aoon
Wait until the next bounce tho
Not from where I bought it
Whoops. I was joking about buying the market dip. But I guess my joke skills are just shit.
I shouldve clarified. Why did everything go down? Im still holding my 2/19 calls
oh yeah I was looking at the wrong graph
Holding 27 and 30c, I sold once the gains on these 25's negated my losses on shares today

Pure psychological self-cucking im afraid
because it's a weekly and double your money in 30 minutes is pretty good?
+30% reeee
this clowns up 40% reeeeee
s only jump up
Yeah. Just goes to show that WSB is being harvested for opportunities.
It could bounce hard, this is the dumbest stock ever.
Pain
I'm playing 12/4 245. Lol
Its not even at open...
Like Fury after Wilder decked him
Oh no... That's worst than bears feasting.
Sell BCE Jan 21, 2022 45p for $6

Buy BCE Jan 21, 2022 45c x 3 for $2 each.


BCE currently at $43.


Rocket emoji or poop emoji?
I'm in 310 calls dated 12/18
Honestly... If somehow I'd been able to time their dips I could be up like 5000% on an overall movement of like 25%
I've made 20 percent return on my oil plays in the last 3 months alone.  I work in oil.  I know whose worth it or not.  I doubt I would have succeeded in any other play.
I sold it when amd was 88.6 this morning.
I don't see how this isn't priced in. It's been known about for 6 months and the CEO has agreed to cooperate.
They have three years to comply with audit standards IF the vote goes through.
I just put in my gains from TSLA this morning into a 250c weekly lotto on CRM. Fully expecting to lose it all but Ill just be at a net 0 for the week then.
400 c for next week, only 400 contracts though, so maybe I was exaggerating
Because its a meme stock
It already went down. So must go up.

already overvalued

lockup ends tomorrow,  **4.6 times current outstanding shares** will be unlocked

 **the unlocked shares are 188 times average trading volume**. Or in other words, **even if only 0.5% of these unlocked shares are sold, that is already more than entire days trading volume.**
14 contracts of 12/18 35p
Investors took time to see if the profits were not fluke
200 shares bought at $20
I was speaking relative to the morning.
All my calls are exp 12/18 and I will likely roll them over further by EOW. Still learning but I already learned to avoid weeklies.
Recommendations on commission based brokers?
Even with a sub $5000 account value?
F

So $3500 aint enough

Its already mooned
short squeeze my ass
very tempting is it gonna go up cause of the senate shit ?
Lol  no way senate will vote on that if dems lose Georgia.
What's a realistic price target if it's true?
I don't think I can do that with $400
better to go longer. markets been having a habit of dumping on earnings week, and recovering the week after
Thanks for the advice !
Why? This run is based on their debt update. Just hold imo. Maybe sell some covered calls at like $2 or higher.

Edit: and apparently rumored merger?
Do you think it's a late buy? I feel like shooting myself in the foot every time I don't double down on Riot.
and can't Milton sell his shares starting tommorow?
Pic or ban
Calls, IV is high but if magic internet money hits ATH its gonna moon
Im up 205% on appn. Ill hold them for years to come.
Thank you! RIP my calls then lol
Lmfao, GOOG AAPL MSFT all charge for cloud space too
exactly, but it just broke out and is at 45, so what now?
I got filled on the Jan at $4.20...Then I realized i could buy the Mar for nearly a dollar cheaper, and got filled at $3.35 on that too....
I got filled at those levels on 6 call spreads on each.
11/27 $25.50p, I jumped the gun a little too early lol it was inevitable
Its popping
Because Id be down 3k instead of 1300 if I didnt. Ill buy back in but wasnt going to keep bleeding
I mean if you like money

Today I looked at shop and it's almost $1200. I had a shit ton of shares when it was like $30.
Delayed Ant till 2022?
Ah
Sorry, Im saying since the SnP inclusion news a couple weeks ago that launched the rocket
dont think so. they said they should have one "soon" so im hoping it works out, as other green stonks have been doing well
Love u bb 
Couple different explanations depending on who you ask. The "automatic remote-operated machine gun" theory is pretty interesting and supposedly confirmed by both sides at this point. They are without a doubt ready to go apeshit. The question is how much can they get away with without being pummeled. It's very interesting how much they keep their responses in check with informing their partners first. Which of course tip us off.
Word. I never sold them against my leaps before. When will RH auto exercise them?
Clever Leaves
Real estate in NYC aint gettin any cheaper in the long run.
I bought a few dozen super cheap puts on the VXX spike, so I've already made a decent profit since it was hard to ignore that rapid of a spike. It resets daily, so I'm not sure how tomorrow will move. So I'm contemplating just closing out at the best time today
Deeper ITM they go, the higher my delta
And it cleared
Ive taken my cost basis and theres still 5k left in those calls for fun. Ill be fine with whatever happens
straight up yolo play
Scooped up 35 contracts between $1.12-1.35 in about 15 minutes of trading
But do you know when the voting is planned?
Oh okay. Whats the reason you *think*?
SaaS company with one third it's marketcap invested in magic coin.
I know.. Amazon has touched 3500 a few times and has a median price target of 3800. Their next earnings will have high expectations but they have had to absolutely kill it this year for holiday shopping.
Thank you for your services but Im not expecting it to print immediately
Im afraid
bought this shit August, made 350% twice, sold 50% each time made that gain
For bulls, yes
Yeah tell that to my Infiniti IV options on SPCE in February
Just signed up for their 7 day free trial deal. So far so good.
Gl to you my dude, let's make some

No, PLTR
What strikes were you looking at? I was looking at 415/417.5/542.5/545 for net credit of $1.05, risking $1.45
tomorrow for sure, just wondering if it will splat ah and what is the right timing....
3.25% Intrest :(
Yup. Im sure well see a nice pop once AMZN says record numbers from Black Friday.
Why is it so expensive?
Why would I be assigned though, it would just expire worthless surely?

Oh I'm retarded nvm
And we knew this several fucking weeks ago..... and?
I do, these are just limit orders in the middle of the options price spread. As soon as the order goes in, the market moves away from me immediately.
APTX is a company
????
Yes thinking the same
Ill do it next time
Onwards
I like this
Holiday season, covid vaccine logistics and earnings run up
Salesforce acquisition talks
lol look at it - its in free fall atm
lol look at it - its in free fall atm
uh...check out the power hour ...now a bounce but dunno.....
I don't see any way possible it skyrockets - Vol is 130% and theta is enormous. Has zoom really increased an exponential amount of paid users since august? Id flip that trade into selling it man.
sry, not spce his new ipo
Nooo we gotta take a last stand bby
Yeah good pick up. Found a gem I guess lol
No jinx just charts.
meaning what
fair. ya just think there should be some selling after 50% in 3 days
You really think so?  ...only 6 minutes left and Im still feeling anxious 
Cmon man want to see all the mandem winning
12/24 600 calls.
Thats what I like to hear!
You probably weren't watching future's ticks
just deleted :)), it's probably the reverse with AMD buying INTC :))
Lol here is hoping ,  I dont want to be a gay bear
Thanks
BRRRRRRRRRR**T**
My wife's bf thinks it's hilarious
Sounds like these share buying people should go over to r/investing
I personally dont think buying shares is a bet. Can it go to zero, sure. Look at NKLA. That steamy pile of shit is still trading. 

But there's no expiration in shares. It could magically bounce and get out. Meh. Not a bet.
I like you too!
All I see is red
At this point GME doubters are choosing to be retarded
Looks like I was right dumbfuck
HYPED BECAUSE ITS MONDAY MORNING 
He might even own SPY.
lol, no its to hedge my 1,000 shares (20 cost basis)
Yea enjoy that **yatch**
Man you sure beat me, and made more money than me today loooool. sucker
what goes up, must come down. Atleast a little
Put that expiry out farther and youre good.
Guess there will be more such todays until this sub finally goes back to loss porn and memes.
Check my posts for gains idiot
This aged well
Lots of buy orders set at 27?
FCEL $6c 1/15/21 sold it (bought when it was $4)
RIOT $8c & 10c 1/15/21
Remind me ! 5 days
Paper hands don't get paid.
Sir, this is a casino
Not now, Fozzy
Ain't nobody got time fo dat
To be honest my stock knowledge very basic, dont even know what a short squeeze is. Should I be picking anything up at market open today?
Td is 24/5
Ok boomer. Ill be on my yacht while you die of covid but youll swear its your diabetus.
To be clear Im not selling. Just laughing at the hive mind
Can anyone explain what will happen to work options if it is acquired by CRM?
Makes sense! Thanks for enlightening my gorilla brain.
Very solid breakdown. Thank you for the info. I will watch this one from the sidelines :)
I bought at 11.40. But my gains disappeared >:(
By repeatedly losing money on stupid plays and learning that you can either have some tendies or no tendies at all. That's how I learned
Yea I didnt get in. Forgot bout that lol

This is a fair point
gotta get on that next level thinking
Ok this changes my mind then
Had puts since Wednesday you inbred obese orangutan. Never speak to me again
You dont think it will rise 50-100%?
Thats a Seeking Alpha article. Like quoting my 8 year old cousin
Thanks
Its fundamentals seem good, so why?
Ya I bought these a month ago and didnt lose very much anyways. Seeing them in my portfolio is a daily reminder of a bad decision
Bears were calling limit down for oil last night lmao
A.. P.. X.. T
can you share some more details on this? are you getting warrants?

im just worried about the early redemption clause once they are exercisable...i think ackman can redeem them for like 10 cents or something?
one step back to take 10 steps foward
good bot; watch the weather change
because a business makes profit greater than zero its a good industry to be in? 

Travel is not just mass tourism (which is been crushed) its also MICE which is not down its been obliterated. Conventions, Corporate travel are a massive part of hotel revenue and thats dead, and now has the threat of both a pandemic AND depressed economic environment as companies are not going to blow money on travel.

Not only is that revenue gone- the vacancy means oversupply and drop in daily rates to fill rooms.
Looking at January 15th $130c at $2.00.
Lucky bastard
But its cheap as shit rn
Bruh there aint no options for 10 years you squid
thankfully i already had SPY puts and GRWG puts
Mostly long positions that Im way up on so Ill ride the dip if it happens.  Few contracts for near the money going to dec & jan on SQQQ and SDOW.  Writing call contracts on the shares I own.
Yah
it will bounce
30%, which is pretty goddamn high
You talking to me or the other guy? Cuz I can defend my claims
Informative answer, and thanks to everyone else.
Taking profits is the way.
Yes, but some people state they are multimillionaires even if they owe 1.2 million in taxes on 2 million in taxable gains.
Our current tax rate is around 45%. We are both high earners. I prefer to under-estimate than over-estimate.
We have over 10 million as of day in our traditional 401k. Our current tax bracket is \~45% I think it massively overinflates things.
Diamond handed my calls to hell and back
How much did you go in 
I just need a 5% bump and its 300% gains. Im not holding till EOW
Never got stop losses to work right
After Airbnb/doordash increased their IPO price rkt is looking cheap. But I dont see a $18 correction soon.
Everyone of these on a 75% bull run in last month
16 - not much but it's mine
I know that every company posting good earnings in this market still goes down after call and that ZM investors are well aware its extremely overpriced and are terrified of the word vaccine.

If the CEO even briefly says, "unsure/uncertain" and "vaccine" in the same sentence, ZM is done

90% confidence it will be down

I saw 9%, where'd you see 15% ?
Shit seems pretty steady. You think its gonna pop?
I sure hope so, my put does not expire fora  long time so I am good but this price action makes me happy.
fck i mean take ur pick, the world is tied in knots now like it hasn't been for 70-80 years, there are so many shoes that could drop....but these guys get the inside scoop
Ty for the response!
>375 comment karma

Lel.
6 and 200. Not that heavy tbh
20P 16.5P
Most likely hedge
MMs thinking we are retards buying the stock at these levels
MMs are short GME. Buying puts doesn't hedge their position
Yea Ik Ive been in for months I just like trolling the daily
Well I don't wanna be responsible for you losing money, but.. ROOT IPO'd and hit a high of $27 a share right away. It's since tanked down to 17.50 and doubts have been raised about its business model and ability to make cash. Their first ER since they came out is tomorrow and I believe that if they surprise the street with positive results that it's going to be up huge, since the consensus right now is that they suck.

Of course, if they fail to deliver I'll likely lose the whole play. For that reason, I would not put a ton of money into this if you are going to play it
$130? GTFO
Read the comment below. This dude was thinking the same thing
This is exactly what I was thinking
Its almost like theyre all in the same sector
Yeah, Im long Raytheon. Ill survive this. Already made a lot of money with them. Only shares with them at the moment, cashed out all my calls already last week.
Sorry retard, PLNHF
I def think its going up short term and up post 2021. Between then I could see it getting turbulent af.
today at $82 premium lol
More worried about NKLA...
Yo theres been a lot dumber questions here I just wanted to make sure I had it right by thinking it was issued shares and not just allotted shares in the articles of incorporation or some shit
So its just total shares issued?
This is the way.
They buy the tasty beer thing yet?
What dat is a corona play
They literally get pumped for like 2 weeks.  I think pltr  is going correct
Thank you, your service does not go unnoticed. Next time do it earlier please and thank you
Do yourself a favor and look at this profiles comment history. Obviously a retard
A lot of people has been pessimistic but it proved its innovative mRNA technology and people are piling in. It will go up like Tesla. No Limits!
380 isnt a bad guess idk fuck it 
I sold puts today, hoping for a rally up
I regret not getting calls @325 rather buying puts on earnings.
Its was a joke lol.
Not sure
A solid company in a rapidly growing industry with strong cash flows, growing sales, and a clean balance sheet with a management who are making acquisitions to continue to grow into related markets using all the cash from the IPO. Its a solid stock that got out of control from FOMO and is going to take a couple weeks to months to settle in a range. You can see huge block order buys on open of every Green Day from the past 2 weeks and huge block order sells at open of every red day the past week. Seems like a MM screwing with people but I cant say for sure.
How is a company that is locked into 5 yr contracts with the govt comparable to GameStop? Palantirs a long play
Pltr is 20% up from last week.  That ain't bad.
lol wut
Its been going up for a month, imagine thinking one bad pre-market day means its dead...
This is wsb. 40c weeklies were bought at the top friday
40C 12/4
Okay see you at the next -5% Robinhood notification and everyone sells off
[deleted]
4%
Most pltr calls out are 12/11 40c, that are down 50% as of posting. Thats theta decay because of the lack of movement as we rush to the 11th
Hey lol
That doesn't erase 15yrs of being a laughing stock and the butt of jokes.
They expire Dec 11th !Remind you 2 weeks
I don't know who you are, but I like you bigly.

Thats my biggest concern, they already have a massive military contract and still cant manage to turn a profit
Right but theyre still not achieving a profit, how do they change this?
But thats not anywhere near a monopoly, if anything theyre a very small player that found a niche in a market that is already subject to a duopoly
So its effectively down 8% then
Im a total retard what did yall expect
I trust, and I hold.
Legit in for long run on stock, but GME is so juicy that its worth selling long holds to buy back later.
Paper hands, we'll miss you on our moon trip
Might run up AH like it usually does
This is the world we live in now tbh honest
RIP in peace bro

Workin on my dad slang
Hahah oops thats good at least
Look at the weekend hype for this thing, that was buying in the morning. Now that shorts have scared the wsb weak hands, only longs are still committed and the fuel for a potential liftoff is destroyed. No SS.
Hindsight is 20-20 man

Look at the liberal making fun of retards
Sure
Since 4am?
Check out their last 3 quarters. Clear gains each. Positioned to beat upcoming earnings on Dec. 16th. With the news and their upcoming earnings im expecting it to fly.
Thanks, you were definitely right. Guess I'm doing a weekly 20c 12/4
We lost it all, okay?? WE LOST IT ALL!!
I held but not happily lol
yea for sure
Smart
Truer words have never been spoken.
This is the way
This fact and my uncanny ability to buy at the top makes this a bad play right now. Thanks
stop, i can only get so hard
lol well yeah if you're holding... no matter what you still lose money today?
This dude is literally only posting about SPI all day.
Nah Im done. But curious, what do you have puts in?
Selling premiums for now and cash 

Gonna be big bear if I see a good window
cuz we are retarded
I'll never be mad about tripling my money
holding 40c 2/21 they better
Sell it like the puss that you are
People hate seeing others get lucky. Its literally no deeper than that.
I love PLTR. Lock up coming soon and peak meme status mean strong pullback. Then time to buy leaps. But imagine there are people here who have 600%+++ return on this and still holding like it's going to 100.
People who never bought in lmfao
hmmm 
oh yeah????
Yeah so are you and you spoke up.
Nope lol
It's been 3 minutes dude
Even that can spell doom, given how leveraged into memes we can get around here.
\-1.4%, -5.5% from intraday peak

"It's flat"
Why are you laughing?
Original
Good luck, 3 of my covered calls expire 12/11 and one this friday
Nah its overextended
yea that must be some interesting journo work, like they are gonna telegraph when they are buying just to make sure they get screwed even more...lol, has to be fake news
Okay whatever you say man all I know is I took my profits and dont regret a thing now lol
Yeah I didn't really get a great entry on Friday

I just bought 5x back but I had 30x so I don't want to risk it right now.

I dumped some into AMD this morning and would rather manage that position tbh
That's what I'm saying, saw like 5 guys like this already
I feel like were there.
Yeah my bad , thats what I was trying to ask but I fucked it up lol
You new here? we dont diversify. YOLO or HOBO
Hate to say it.... Citron got it right this time
Fight me bruh
there's no rumour, they just trolling
So they should be included in the S&P because they showed profits for four quarters using accounting tricks? Yes, I am a bit concerned for my 401K, so I will not gtfo.
GME
I'm a TSLA bull but there's always pullback.  Don't you remember Sep. 1?
Wut theres no options for them
It dropped almost 10%
Late December

Better than not coming at all. Get in still. Room to go still, no one has had a shot in the arm yet
No way, you can use face id for apps?
Nope I got the upgraded Iphone SE 2020. It's got the same processor as the 11
Feb calls
Theres an actual vote
Ok thank you friend
Why?
No expiry
Thesis: When a stock goes the fuck up in a short time, i buy puts and make a killing.
I'm just talking about today, what goes up always comes down... not talking long term here
They hold a giant position on magic internet money, and the Citron retards just gave them a giant price target.
I have jan 15 for 97.5 and 100. Ill roll out maybe today. Got a big handful of 100 when they got smacked to like .80 a couple week ago
Because Pfizer has contracts with ink dried for millions of units. I have sources. I am ready for us to all be rich. Theres a fucking pandemic and the company thats about to bring the cure isnt getting any attention.
they all started dumping Nov 24 ffs
ill either buy back at 28-30$ or 21-22$
bought since 9$
The have been for a while now. Unless they went ham.
This was 'known' for a while and there is no news.
I dont think its gonna dump forever. Just wondering if we bottom out today or tommorow
Thanks man and yeah still rooting for this stock. A CFA wrote up a good analysis on seeking alpha yesterday if you didn't see. My main concern is a 3-5% total market correction before End Of Year. Willing to take a hit on calls but this helped me up my annual Roth Return to 50% so didn't want to risk fucking that up.
Its def trying to. Vix has been fighting to go up or down for the last 10 mins
Write a call.
Yeah not sure it will print but its so low theta wont screw me can bounce in a day or two with profit

Edit its a spread so 615 guy took the hit.
Yo mamas shaved pussy.
They are fraud too..go look at their business. None of their trucks are any more efficient than a diesel engine. None of their numbers are backed by any research or evidence.
agreed, prob buy a leap on each just cuz.. I'm liking plug, its the highest value one but Blackrock has a 10% stake and I trust em
Lol ooof
Hope
TDA charging  $.65 per contract $1.3 for open and close contract
Yeah, and the lock up officially ends today which means all of their early investors including their fraudulent founder can sell their shares tomorrow.
The lock up ends tonight, so I think they'll print. But I don't want to sway you either way, it's your money.
Inverse this guy. Why would anyone sell on news of inclusion?
Last time. And that was also the only time riot did anything. It might jump a little based on speculation of a repeat is waiting for lighting will strike again.
Didnt put much on it, just in case
Its a hellavu drug.
So when it goes in the money and tanks to $45 by next week where will these $45 puts be at...since you understand IV so well. It's at $2.20 right now (the $45 puts are down for the day with NIO Crashed down 4%).
Darn zm down a shit load
When tf will it be tradeable?
Clearly talking about today
nah that was last week lol :(
Yeah thanks for the helpful info. I meant beyond that
After this position expires it wouldnt even be worth the time spent adding me on Venmo lmao
Not to mention it's still up bigly today...
As long as your nice to people tho
I'm 69 and READY TO FUCK
He works at melvin capital
Hell yeah brother fuck da rules

I must be a 
If I had any money left I would buy puts around $20 hahaha
But he just bought in now
That's what happens when Stocktwits starts posting over here and getting everyone on board for dumb shit.
Merger on dec 3rd or extension?
no u
PLTR isn't?
Better than PLTR
If a 20% gain doesnt cause shorts to cover after up 200% in the past 3 months what is going to?
How mad are u?
PLTR is dashboard.
They're acquiring Tesla
They got pushed out of the largest fastest growing market on earth and are so desperate theyre lobbying for turning blind eyes to concentration camps to try to suck Xis dick.  Sounds like a desperate company to me.
Fucking  piping up shitty stocks for us to put, why even put in any work might as well quit my job
...I said as I took a red one up my bum 
Its riding cause everybody hyped it up its been dropping for the past 2 days but hey your right keep your life savings in therebhave fun
Calls on BBI.B Blockbuster Stock Price.
1. WSB is my education. 

2. ok
how am I the clown making money? lel
Im long term bullish on PLTR but I can see this sliding for a few more days
I own $260K of VOO. I never wanted to own TSLA, but now it's going to be part of my holdings. I don't want the risk that TSLA adds to my portfolio, so I'll go short on TSLA to cancel out the effects it would have on my VOO position.
My bad, allow me to correct myself: 
He's going to buy an above-ground pool with his gains.
Yeah all $60 Id lose. Bet that get you so turned on
Just announced Lion
Lion Electric  

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lion-electric-merges-with-northern-genesis-acquisition-2020-11-30
Unfortunate ticker, but they will be LEViosa'd soon
Could be the next meme stonk.  I'll be getting 100 sh this morning and just sit on it.
My main concern is the possibility of delisting because of the bill being voted on Wednesday,I know they'll have 3 years but still spooky. Kinda ignorant on it all though.
Oops, yes pltr. It's fading fast
PLTR pretty flat still from friday, I'm more asking about selling PLTR than I am buying into GME
Thats why no one will remember your name
*Bear Gang Solder* - as retarded as it gets
Where it was range bound for several months and of course makes a move when I have no calls left. The way of the world.
I believe rising tide. Plus premiums and iv is low atm
No Im serious. It keeps saying 0/2 purchaed
Oh I see. Thanks!
[deleted]
I meant intraday today you fuckwit
Wow, powerful edit, how will I ever recover from this blow
He probably shorted at 110 and got screwed
Scared money :(
Whats the lie?? Dow is down .51 in premarket
lol sure bro
Loool aight. Cheers for the help mate
Damn ur going thru each and everyone of these 19.8k comments? Jeez get a life bro.
Yeah. Will be adding more if it goes down. Gonna follow the rich mattress retard. Might end up carrying his bags though 
...here in my garage...
they will go for ipo price 38.5 or maximum 40.0 not more, and in this time slack has grown its revenues nicely. CRM can cross sell the shit out of WORK
238 when I posted, it is 245$, ha ha
This.
yeah
It's not a naked call, it's a covered call. Which is why I am confused, since RH doesn't even allow selling naked puts or calls, why am I seeing this message. Software glitch?
I already own 100 shares of the underlying, you brain-dead POS. Go fuck yourself, dumb ass.
it's a covered call. goddamn imbecile.
This dude is literally always wrong
shhh, he is in his own world
You call me stupid and then type a comment like that lmfao
Can you trade options before that?
i bought Moderna at 13 and told all of you guys to buy it many many times.
Tens of thousands sitting on the sidelines while I buy puts on you idiots meme stocks and add to the stockpile
Thats why I asked, this sub is that smart s/
Thanks for the nice answer.
Because theyre voting for it on Friday.
Lol
No, Im still holding. I was just wondering.
Guess Im gay then
Has been very disappointing since the split and has hardly popped and held up
You meant 10?
:)
:)
Congress is back in session too so we will hear the words second stimulus on the news 100x today.
So just buy right away?
Lol. Ura
When people start showing up that dont even know basics like what time the market opens, I worry we're close to a top
Fucking noobs
You gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers.
Yup exactly
Hold steady bro, itll fly past there again in due time.
Im too retarded.

Why is GME a good play?
its not the name per se, its more having a baby boom that creates a special interest group larger than any other in the history of the market.
Said everyone for the last 6 months 
x10
5 times as much
$500 in 5 years
Lol yeah, so what are you talking about?
I wish I had that level of both cash and retardation.

Instead I'm cursed with being smart and poor.
If you have shares you dont need to be staring at the ticker all day, it is fun tho
.. well.. I mean, whatever works. We're reasonable folk.
Paging u/haupt91 to create a new meme where jannies play the zuck sitting before congress fielding questions about why they let little Timmy lose their summer job money to some WSB pumper.

Just remember when that day comes to empathize and say you'll do better next time.

I can only present the facts that took place to you, I can't understand it for you
Faded hard in yurop in the last hour, not looking good man
Yes, making it clear for all the newbs. Unlike bears, I don't want anyone here to lose their money.
No, its definitely not always like this and it wont last much longer. A bunch of idiots pump stocks and then it becomes an echo chamber for either shit stocks or shit DD on why a stock will skyrocket, when in reality it will be flat or plummet. Glad youre making some money rn though!
Be cautious, no, it is not typical for WSB to get so much so right for so long. If only it were that easy.
Bit hard when I went all in at $32 lol
something something inverse cause autistic
im a retard so yes
Im not in love with it. I do think its a good long term play though. But the fundamentals are shit, nobody cares about that. 

Seems to have a good floor. Can see this over 30 by end of year. But this is not a short term play anymore.
Lol lots of ways to make money bud.
I want to double my money on this within a month. Get going.
Sort of, but there is still some room left to run till $20. T H C B boat is still open.
Fuck that'a 2 months salary for me
Diamond hands
How is until the end of the holidays a long term play?

I have decent positions in both, so I am not missing out on anything lol

but I did not say GME is a good long term play, no idea if they end up going bankrupt after all.
So. Even more reason to dab. Not as stinky...
Momentum? They're two completely different industries.
I feel for the people who bought their first calls ever going high on PLTR today. Crazy...
Nah man. I'm playing the run up to their next earnings which is 12/8 I believe. I'm planning on selling this new half of my position a day or two before earnings and holding the other half through. Could change my mind on that decision but I think earnings will be a good catalyst.
ask around people take my advice seriously and I actually make money unlike 99% of you tards

can't have a troll name and still be smart?
Lol I really dont know but I dont think itll drop
Below $12. Im just building my position so when mergers announces I can hopefully get a 40% day
what you buy
Depends which way you go if you go backwards then it's been a while but if you go forwards it's hardly been a week :)
well there ya go
The key is they are letting the public sell shares before milton. Thats the point of doing the agreement. Im sure they wouldn't let gm get out b4 dec 3rd
I think well be alright. The closer we get to inclusion the more big index buyers are going to be buying into Tesla. Any dip until inclusion should theoretically be pretty short lived.
$50? Damn why do you think that? I know theyre partnered with MSFT, but what do they really have to offer that MSFT will want
Yeah you should hold 
To riches or poverty !
nah I ain't buying it any time soon tho either

I might buy it from em if I make another 1k off GME this month though as a thank you
Ok thank you
Yes the n word with a hard r
i'm positive nobody gives a fuck about a 1 dollar and some change gain options are up less than 10% looool are you serious or just retarded?
Yep man, bought 2 shares in GME just for the memes
Look agian bruv
Wont be an announcement anytime soon. Extending date until April. Just securing profits.
Day aint over. 3pm rally
Ya it's only up 11% today what a piece of trash \s
Theres two tickers on webull, APHA TSE and APHA Nasdaq
Cuban cigars - *bought!*  
Sea monster - *released!*  
God - *trusted in!*  

Yep, it's Karen-time!
Do we want them to extend or nah?
Different, but same... 

(in for 400 shares)
No its already pretty low compared to the rest of its sector and with how big gaming was over the summer and past couple months theyve had to well
Little chubby? Your cat is Lizzo.
oh any reason for that
Thanks
Nah it was good 20% haha

I commend your commitment to the YOLO.
Case in point
it looks charged up to run past 600
You. lol $TSLA is gonna rip tomorrow.
What happened to the retard strength and what causes the insane sell-off from last week?
i mean lets say they blast off and warrants become vfalued at like 5-6 bucks, thats a huge multiplier. why are you only in 600? Im catching shares cuz i like the floor as well
Im not cash flush Ive lost al my gains today
So you think ima snitch now too? The moon has NOTHING to do with the market. Im allowed to voice my opinion.
28.5 for me now, almost like it's not a constant number.
Yeah, I'm hoping CRSR stays under 40 today. the meme spacs are too massively green it's too late for me to get more of those.
If I had that much in available funds I wouldve loved to
Unless you have calls or you intended to cash out today, why do you care about the bleeding right now? It will rocket back. RELAX.

Same with PLTR, people panic sell at a loss for no reason. Just chill.
Should have got in earlier retard
You are good fam, shit V shaped :D hopefully you didnt get paper hands
I want to believe! But too many holds during earnings have resulted in massive bloodshed. Just saying be careful. <3 you all
it can go either way.. massive dump or pump
Yes. This lesson i have learned today
Well good luck to you and your endeavors, and remember, buy high sell low
yup, these people just dont get it...
it's a pump and dump because its a shell company that only has cash behind its ticker. It hasn't even announced a deal yet.
>The number of shares doesn't change. 

That was the point fucktard, glad you took the bait.

It's only a penny stock for those treating it as such.
but when things usually get added, do they spike?
After a sharp climb, pullback and consolidation is great for the stock. Look at the massive volume and the price still holds at $27.
Thx sir!
Macys 
Pltr 
HMMMM!
It literally inversed me haha.
Really. Here it s packed inside SBX
Kiss me if that happens
everything is tankingvunless spy tsla etc just taking a quick shit
All I can give you is an upvote but thank you
I bought back in pretty quickly so it's fine
Lets all just go to the Winchester and wait for all this to blow over.
Spreading rapidly? Theyre culling any outbreaks of any disease in the world. Minks. Turkeys. Humans. It happens.
Earnings call
Earnings report
Earnings call
Earnings report
So on that thought process, you wouldn't pay 5 dollars a month to have unlimited day trades? Lol
will be a fun ride for sure
I said the same thing earlier

if we can maintain 18 through EOD it would be super bullish for the rest of the week things are setting up for a large move up towards the EOD it seems right now
Boarding the PS5 train while it's still at the station, total WSB move.

Sign me up too pls, my PS4 sounds like a Harrier on start up and any time there are more than 4 pixels being displayed.
i did all 12/4 but gonna sell half before close most likely
sure, but lets stay level headed. GL
I'll get the M4 then.
In my personal opinion it ran up too far and too fast. Ill be giving it some time to find some solid support and then looking to play the next run up. Just my opinion.
Yeah, best sell calls in AAA+ blue chip stock to buy FDs into weed SPACs.
Well I dont know if you actually have margin or not, but the margin line is the line of losses youre allowed to sustain before your broker sells the shares you bought with their loan money.
lol.. flat from 11:05am to 4pm
I'm a little fish with just 55 shares, but we're still in it together

Just 1 call Im up 300% on
40% item returns and negative YOY numbers during a pandemic lol
I worked at a podiatry clinic. We would recommend Asics theyre a great running shoe and look great as well. If not new balance has some alright looking shoes as well. Youre probably looking for some arch support. If you have either of those stores they have employees that can help tailor your purchase to which shoes would help you most
Shoes? No.

What you should do If you're really looking is go to a specialty running store. They'll take measurements, a gait analysis, and give you some actual recommendations.
Im staying in NIO until it hits 300+ by 2023. It will be the reason I make my first million
Stocks
the play for the potential short squeeze is really in shares, not options
any time man.
You dont always have to sell you can sell a call to lock in gains and prevent a day trade. At least pltr is down but not in the red
Dangerous game
I mean I already had this from over a week ago. So I should sell it and buy shares to help maximize the value?
Is up again, I was planning to buy more if it dip to 16s
True - i'm all calls now though. Statistically, 54% of the time market goes up.
LEAPs here are a pretty solid bet
The dip was this morning. Went all the way down to 554. No more dips for you!
HELL YEAH $30 EOW
Any of them.
Canada
Still time for u, long way until $1000
never underestimate how retarded wbs can be, sometimes i wish i was enough so i couldve made a bagger
Im just saying maybe an opportunity for something that has more upside right now. Might be calls, might be a meme stock, might be both, who knows
Sell calls, u have to have at least 100 shares
Decided to jump into CRSR instead
There are a lot upcoming positive news coming up in December regarding covid-19 and vaccine this week which should increase confidence in the market. PLTR is also still recovering from last Friday's news following the news of the short and is expected to recover from here as most of the sellers have already exited their positions.
Word
Every time I look at ACB I just get plain mad, but I literally can't get over myself to buy into this shitty company.
Lol
He said LOUDERRR
lol good luck mate!
ask ur wifes boyfriend for an advance on your allowance and buy some fuckin GME
YESSS FUCKING SIRRRR
I sold them to someone for .30 ........
11.5c 12/4 I did it. Sounds like it would jump to that of 28ish was last time. 11.5 is also the max robinhood will allow me
My point is, the saving is likely more than the loss of gains. In any case things can change
Not proud to say that I sold one close to the top friday. Sold others at 27 and 25 strike with decent premium.
I remember it had a fat day last earnings. 10x revenue target or something
...because of the massive runup in first half 2020 dog...
, yeah I hear yah dude. All
My friends are fcking idiots. Good for you man
Bears not allowing moon time
ya, it's hard to complain about a 2% day when EVERYTHING is red.. when the global panic is over I hope it'll rise again!
GME is a 3-6 month play, don't worry about weekly gains bruh
Biggest SPAC ever with special warrant stuff to keep long term investments in the game. Check out their tontine idea
I
Yup, saw it on Friday too when it was up 8% pm and then 10% in the red by lunch. This PM pump is even weaker
thats premarket

u said futures brotha

but good looks
Wowwwwwwww. Glad I took my profits at open and will be buying in later 
yeah, I think they will be too expensive for my blood... but I legit can see this going to $10 in a week
Didn't you write this before? I might be mixing this with some other story
Yes buy shares the squeeze will happen soon, the sooner everyone buys
Never
Holy
Shit
Weed  = thc
As I understood it, those are big firms that quote the price of the stock. So if they say the price is x, then people would think it's x
You gave in the fomo 
ask your mom
or hold I guess, I play more options (so roll for me), I seem to be able to do more plays on the money I got lol
I do indeed. Dating next Friday.
Thats actually biontech with Pfizer handling logistic shit right?
Do me first
Youll still make some gains bro, just hold onto it for a while. Stock was surging after it hit 24, back up to 27 after 30 mins
Sold Fcel at the top this morning and put it almost immediately in Nchl. Dont ask me why.
https://tenor.com/search/denzel-my-man-gifs

Oh you have no idea
You'd have to go to Heaven to get her to do that!
Welp Im all in. Pltr tsla and apha see ya on the moon
Well hopefully by mid december we nail 2.5 so my lotto put can print
So the house vote has absolutely nothing to do with it?
The shares are .75 and the $1c for three weeks out is .40 lmao
Correct. Speaking from experience I have done that trade and it then ranked below what I made on the CC before it pumped again today
Loll honestly the last two weeks have been a bumpy ride. But I agree, I wasnt letting go.
I like Jan 15th as thats right near their earnings, and inauguration week, and i *think* that insulates you from IV crush after the vote
i meant bottomed and finally corrected. analysts were very bullish but said it should be at $36 or something last week.
Yeah I don't buy shit that expires or sell shit that can cost me more money later on general principle but I don't belong.
Yup holding forever, my first stock was tsla in march and sold it @500
Edit: after split I mean in the summer not march
Thanks, looks good - Im in then with shares. How do you know this was the last day of profit taking?
God I hope so

Diamond hands - I'm keeping these lottos til exp
Ah, that'd do it
Strike/date?
Its following the pre/post spac merger pattern

People are piling into the top about to learn a hard lesson
Thats not necessarily a good or bad thing. Ideally youd want to trade high volume options because theyre more liquid. Open interest is how many contracts are outstanding right now
I held. I think we hit 30 in PM tomorrow!
big fan of editing the 10k down to 5k as this powerhour continues to suck lmfao


Idk, I like fancy dinners or fancy whisky personally if I wanna blow some money, you do you :)
Bluff
yeah thats what im eyeing...
Holy fuck that dump lol
True, dec seems to be make or break
Yeah I can give you $2.43 each in store credit for your shares
Ah, good to know this. The place was becoming a pump and dump scheme. Happy that the mods have taken it seriously and interjected. Appreciate all the work you do!
I'm just giving you shit. We know you guys bust your ass and that it's a thankless job, so thanks. 
Haha thanks man, only been doing this a few months so kinda stressful when its red n shit
It burned me bad once. I have a personal vendetta to shit talk anyone on here shilling it. Lol so don't take my comment personally.
Username checks out
AirPods (everyone now has them)

iPad (literally no other comparable tablet in the market)

M1 chips (now just cut out intel middleman for insane unheard of generational performance improvements on small computers and its only their 1st gen chip)
wasn't it announced like 2 weeks ago tho
I'm in Ohio. All the big box stores are.
I dont think they will but I think the drama is going to dampen growth of their stocks this week. Remember a few weeks ago how Trump's dumbass tweet had caused a huge sell off of Chinese EV that sparked alot of drama around NIO earnings
  
Respectable and salary are two words that likely don't pertain to 54% of this sub my dear friend lmao.
Im bout to load up on all vaccine stocks. Soon as this thing gets REAL whoevers the winner in this race will blow uppppp and whoever leads behind wont even fall that far.
In the end MRNA (up a lot), PFE, and RKT held. PLTR not so much. So your day ended up better than the morning.
Thats the case for everything 
I sold shits too stressful
Buy more before 30 wall is broken
25k here
Don't sell, dude. The lizard overlord are going to try to shale you out.
just saying the volume isn't even crazy yet
Alrighty ty
yep, funny cuz Im disappointed with a 10% day lol, since we were up 20% at one point, but I believe we will go back up
lmao nice nice nice. It's back to -7%. Hope you sold lol
Yeah,  I only had a few thousand in gains. I was planning to hold until January for taxes as well but I'd rather pay a bit of taxes than poaaibly lose all my gains
Low expense ratios, high diversification.  A slow gainer but better than cash
NP.  Eat my own cooking as that is all the stonk etfs in my Roth.
if they vote to extend it'll probably be seen as a sign that the deal is in fact going through they just need more time to get things in place and tie loose ends, in which case, not mooning but big green. If it doesn't go through, thiccB shutters and pays out 10$ per share. If the merger completes it'll be January IIRC (don't take my word) and THATS when it moons.
Not in my opinion, but anything can happen I suppose. A lot of the environmental regs are done with executive order, so the senate doesnt play as big of a role as some other legal sectors. ICLN is also global, so its not just the US
retard strength is very strong
Which stock?
??????? not possible??? are you buyign the wrong options LOL
I think the time is soon for a big pop off. If my 12/18 14c pop way off Ill sell and immediately reinvest in calls 2-3 weeks out of when I sell.
Hoping there is another leg up to 640 or so next couple of days
j chill. It sucks seeing all these high flyers elsewhere, but im sticking to my guns. Time in is better than timing the market
Its up 80% in a week. I sold my position. Idk how sustainable that is
Hang tight its gapping up
nice nice i got apexi, the bea, and gi k. hope we see some pop big soon.  isnt gi-k supposed to pop this week?
Prepare to be tired as fuck. I started with a scratchy throat and then basically slept for 4 days
Man its the stock market. Im balls deep In calls

But Ill explain best I can

So if its 1 round Tesla rips to $700 purely based of the volume of the buy and short squeeze

So if its 2 rounds of inclusion then I can see this dropping a bit, then overall going up. Probably is if you are in weeklies you will be fucked
You holding through kt ?
Coworker who I was moving in with
https://venmo.com/code?user_id=2029337318522880053  (I promise you wont regret this)
Still dont understand why people have apple in their portfolio, it moves like a snail  paltry 1% gains when theres bigger dicks out there
Short squeeze is intensifying. Just google the Volkswagen infinite squeeze
Oh yea Im saying from here on out brotha
True i hadnt thought of that
What a dirty little ass slut.
Welcome to r/wallstreetbets. What did you expect
Ive been in GME since $8, Im at 700% profit
Actually a good idea.
So close 

The option premiums Barely moved
Lol I mistakenly thought the OP said toilet paper. Puts on my reading comprehension.
Ok yea youre retarded
fair point
Well when you put it that way it makes even less sense.
Not really for me. Im not buying antiques or used items on Amazon. Two entirely different uses for the companies.
Thats what theyre thinking.  

Its still hype at this point.

If its Stripe this will move upward quickly.
Will drop around earnings
Hold till earnings, and if you wanna sell before close then go ahead. You probably will be up quite a few dollars then anyway so take profits
Yeesssss
the WSB way
I was gonna argue until you mentioned retards. You right.
Ok retard
My play is to watch the 1m candles after open and decide from there if thats any consolation. I think there will be some red before it goes green its still up a bunch from Fridays close
Why not cgc?
Shiieeett. No one has had any shots yet. Can probably still get back in
Hopped on Friday. Only got 25 12/11 9c contracts, but thinking about selling half this morning and taking some profits. I've gone through big gains followed by big dips with pot stocks too often to not..
Think itll be volatile today or nah? Thinking it can touch 27-29 on the news. Thinking of buying puts there. Thoughts?
Itll fall but not until nobody is looking anymore
well I got in and out, so if it has more to run I bestow blessings on it.
Shoulda stuck it in game up 20%
lol sick
Dec 1 afaik
I mean, considering we are in WSB.... I guess it depends on how you're calls are doing. But personally, I'd throw em in the garbage.
yeah i hopped out and decided to take profits now. also had 12/4 calls and i still have faith that aapl will continue to rise over the next few days but just wanted to take my gains just in case haha
Solid advice for next time
if they had merged it wouldve rocketed
Nah idk. I'll wait till Dec 3rd for the vote and see what it does before I dump
you in for shares or calls?
I never regret taking profit. But hopefully it moons on the announcement. If it continues to dip I may get back in
They're going to vote for extension until april, but should still be bullish. Otherwise they would have until dec 7 to complete the merger which is impossible
There are still some, probably from the stubborn cult. Once we open tomorrow though I reckon it'll tank hard. GM backed out of their deal, Nikola has nothing going for it.
Hope thats in a ROTH. Nice work, man. Not to get all r/investing in here but if youre feeling your heart get heavy on any given day of trading, then you might want to buy and forget. It doesnt have to be boring shit, but if you think about how much time was spent worrying about a few thousand... that can add up, man. Good luck
You have 2 weeks to exp.  ur good.  Relax
If I could afford it, I would. I made the mistake of selling amd when I was balls deep at $4. Big poor now
Yeah the multiplayer is meh as of right now to be fair... but zombies is so good.
Thats what it hinges on. Possible pullback to ~$12 or moon, based on guidance.
Word is early/mid December. Let us hope for an early Xmas
52 vs 65 to break even, i like to play it safe i guess
Even with 1 year long options?
You have shares, diamond hand it and youll be fine
See you on Friday
Yikes. I feel sick to my stomach for you
Rumors of possible acquisition, and the house is working on passing the MORE act
It may have been a bad idea
Well for your childrens well being I am glad that was a typo lol
Its the top so far
nah i been bagholding for a month and have not taken profits yet

big news later this week at a Boston Marijuana Conference...im holding till them, which also coincides with the house vote.

should be a great week, I'd def get back in if i were you. free tendies
I got some ACB when they were cheap today..we'll see
In since day one. Feels good man.
Interesting. Sounds like the Walmarts are packed there and people aren't wearing masks.
I would expect a small rise near the end of the day due to anticipation. Might be better to buy them now. I expect at least a good size bump up tomorrow morning.
I'm 40% cash, highest in a long time. Taking it day by day, don't see any reason to buy based off today's activity. Again tho - day by day. I don't see anything coming down the pike to cause massive upside that's not already partially priced in, plenty to cause downside imo (government shutdown, no stimulus, possible Senate flipping in January)
Normally, yes, and normally I'm on the writing side, but this is a particularly clear trade in my opinion. They killed the only hopeful bullish narratives and insiders also had their shares unlocked today. This has the unique setup where even though it's down 25%, I don't see much chance of not having a lot more downside without much for bounces. Too much running for the exit non stop.
P/E is out of whack
Lmao
ev battery makers first
plz yes
Yeah I meant 45-60 lol just right before the curve kicks in
Right ! Hold while your down. I buy calls out at least 3-4 months. 95% of the time holding pays off. The patient people making money are just getting it at a discount from the inpatient people.
Rhetorical question retard 
Thanks
I like to fuck
What is that subreddit? Thank you in advance
That's the way my boy
And the earrings before that? Huh? I was trying to make money off of CRM before you even knew what options were. I bought 5 straddles at er in 2019 and it did exactly jack shit at ER.
Lol yep thats me

My calls are down 74 percent 

The memes were just so good here I got roped in
Or I for you... may the most retarded retard win. Fuck Theta
Biden broke his foot being a senile old man & fauci said he wants to lock Merica down
CNOOK... they getting added to some list today (they are attached to Gyna military). SMIC been in the works for a while and think it's getting that same treatment today too.
twat
Sounds like some big brother shit
I swear on my life I will buy you one share of PLTR if Apple hits $135 by close on Friday. I will literally cash app you enough money to buy that share. But you have to agree to buy me one share at apples price if it doesnt hit $135
Definitely. Original sell target was 120 but moved it down to 119.5 after seeing todays price action
Thanks guys! Can you give me more details on the bill? who's voting for what? what's your opinion in terms of the outcome of the bill? Just to understand a bit more how to play this... (sorry I am not very familiar with this industry). Thanks a lot again for your time
how u playin this
Im glad I waited to buy in. Bought in at 17.70.  Hoping we see a pump tomorrow!
I'm betting it's gonna move like your girlfriend on her boyfriend's dick around earnings, so any +/- until that is basically irrelevant. Even if you FOMO you have to at least know what you are FOMOing into. I'm not selling unless this sucker goes to at least 60 before then.
notable examples of the type of squeeze and candle patterns expected. [https://www.warriortrading.com/short-squeeze-definition/](https://www.warriortrading.com/short-squeeze-definition/)
also SUPER shorted. [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)  Share statistics mid right section.  all those positions need to find a way to cover at whatever the market charges.  It's going to get stupid.
Whoops lmao I read your position as opposite of what it is. I must be tired. I agree with you 100%
Yeah lmao true. Nearly no one will want this thing haha
Exactly what Cuomo said.  He influenced many NYers to stay away from it
Should've put /s I guess.
 What was what?
Yeah your right
Fuckin a I was. Blew loads all day Sunday too
Hope you're right man. Jacked to the tits on 20p Dec4th rn! lettssgoooo
70
Got in, got $$$, got the fuck away.
Less than 25% in my opinion but its non zero. There are plenty of high profile backers that even if they dont land stripe theyll land something great
They made it clear that theyre only interested in merging with an established player so the hype alone will move the stock until q1 but yeah it would be huge if its stripe. Look up the videos on YouTube and theyll explain better. Theres wayyyyy more upside than downside on this play.
Then we are dead men!
Also gme is still going bankrupt. This is simply a short squeeze
Markets are retarded is the best answer I can give ya
I was downvoted by people selling me CRSR is a dip and will correct AH each day of the correction.
paper hands??
Die-loooooo-shun
Or before it tanks. Shit been flat for months.
Oh ok, so you had some time but took profit now which was a good move. I like Amazon long
Yep but China will not allow compliance audits. Market is forward looking. Investors will pull out from a company that has delisting risk in 3 years.
This why we cant have nice things
us tsla warriors need to be patient, u got a entry point in mind?
You should know you entry and exit points before hand.

If you're going to make emotional plays don't fuck with meme stocks. Or stocks in general tbh.
Lol no. Unlike most retards here I'm not completely invested into one company. But you're legitmately retarded if you think this is just a PLTR thing. Almost every stock is down today
Ya but.. what if... lol
Name of the tracker? No link needed
Because its not true. On a few days last week it shot up midday. Generally I agree with you on most stocks. I buy eod. Sell in the morning. Just not the case for PLTR.
 https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9d6cfcca-acf5-4296-aac3-8ae72bd670bd
Ah a riddle, I will think about this one and come back when I figure it out
Jeeze you're crushing it!
Nice. I bought at $36.43. Could have got a better deal but Im happy with that.
Just normal stonks. I'm too stupid for options
I originally got in at $19 but added heavy late. Average around $27. 

Good thing is I kept my rules and kept my position size to 5% of my portfolio.
Yeah, I have no doubt that the numbers will look good but man they'll be dodgy on guidance since it'll look horrific.

They were sub $400 just a couple weeks ago.
Shares are what you want.
Say no more
Easy double down.
Roll
cheers, may the tendies flow freely for you!
Lol I lost my first thousand on a Tesla call. Ive done better since then. Stay away from FDs. Tesla will spank you for that
Dec 18 is a lottery ticket, 2022 more reasonable though.
Im not I got in like 10 min ago at ATH realised that was extremely retarded, sold for a tiny loss and now Im just gonna watch from the sidelines. See what the next meme stock is and maybe hop on, but this time not get greedy like I did with PLTR
nah, they are a multistate dispensery operator that will benfit significanlty with federal regulation and the ability to utilize banks. Additioanly commanilty of rules across states, which doesnt exist now, will also provide operating cost reduction. just sayin!
true
I have even decided to help out by buying 200 shares at the top of the rally
I also am bad at taking profits.
Hope you did better than I did. Lost about 20% overall.
Nah man I think you're good, you have a lot of time. My calls were much shorter dated (Jan 21), and I didn't see a recovery to my breakeven point soon enough to not get killed by theta
-24/+22.  I'm an animal lol
Thats what its always trying to do!
BABA is a fine investment but not on a Friday timeline. BABA 300 with 3-6months is safer than friday calls.
Could be a new feature I suppose
Do you have a price target in mind or are you just riding the pop out?
interesting take - thanks
They keep buying the shares, which is why is hasn't been dipping for the last three hours !
If its two rounds I think itll still see a steady gain. And then a slight sell off after round one. The only way I really see it selling off before then is it Elon issues more shares of the stock. The chances of that being extremely slim.
Genomics (CRISPR and genetic engineering)
hold thru earnings i dare u
And you as well my friend


Im in for $30k on TSLA so just confirming bias
Good move see you on the other side homie
chwy and apha
You were smart, be relieved!
Nice, hope those hold and continue to print gains tomorrow. I'm day trading some VXX right now that I'll probably sell before close and look where to put my money, so I'll be eyeing those as my next move
Got into 130C 12/17 last week for $0.30, up 158% right now 
my  didn't do shit all day, n bout 20mins ago little feller woke up
I loaded up this morning on 12/18 $8.5c and 12/24 $9c
Yeah you gotta have something before quitting your job. Ideas don't make money. First start generating some revenue then maybe consider quitting your job. Most companies start out as side hussles.
I cant imagine how ecstatic you mustve been when the market opened
Earnings. Its going to take a dump very risky play
Tight!
Ah. I just calculated off the current price. Why so bullish?
strike and expiration? also what was the bid ask spread and volume on the calls?

14/4?
Sure but then you cant complain when you get burnt because that is literally just gambling
Damn Ive lost so much money cause I didnt know this LOL
Yeah that was a rough 15 minutes. If I lose it all I deserve it honestly. Stupid play
I've been watching Sorrento since before it popped the first time because I noticed this back in March:
https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fl38vh/question_about_unusual_options_activity_does_it/

Stock price at the time was $1.7, it was my first big options play

I just don't know that it'll pop before EOY.
Oof. Big if true.
Most of us did. Rebounding slowly cause i was just down $200 lmao
I'm sure you did. I'm surreeeeeeeee you did
BTW its headed back up...
lol
Day before earning, next week.
So yaybe?
anything around 15 is already golden for me, 20 is the dream. If it goes 30 i'll buy my girlfriend's boyfriend a Lambo so he can fuck off
If you know anything about appl youll find out theyre making their own processors and gpus and going to become solely sustainable, pltr definitely can reach $100 but you saying something smart beside something dumb only makes you dumb
Are you a bot?
12%
69%
Whatever it takes to feel alive again 'namsayin

yeah especially with my hand
Oh my fault, thought you meant a tea and a water. Sounds good
I'm new so just to help with my understanding, if most shorts are at $18, anything above that will potentially trigger a short squeeze?
Yes
stop loss cant stop this loss
$30 call 12/31
I bought the Corsair dip when it plunged straight to hell. Bought $Thcx earlier in the day, up 5% on that
I also dont have any positions in PLTR, I sold them Friday at the big sell off, got in at $18
PLTR is pretty much green in a few minutes. No dips left
When is your expiry?
LMAOOO LETS GET THIS GME BREAD
then what is your reasoning. Say it or ban.
I made tons of money from NIO and PLTR today. Red means profit right?
Agreed that is a nice play.
They really need better marketing. 0 hype
That's fair. I'm hoping it goes up a bit in early 2021 :( from trader - bagholder haha.
shares or calls?
Or sell at open roll house money into calls into 600 ;)
It was priced in 11/9
Yes. But with the upcoming vote no harm in doing one of the two and HEXO. It's a baby stock so maybe penny stock lovers will hop on it for a little while. Anways, long term hold, it could be a mediocre profit.
Only some of their projects, theyre focusing on the commercial side of their business if you listened to the investor call...
No but it doesnt take much to read reviews from Glassdoor.
Doesnt mean Netflix isnt trying to hire the best people
Thats a tough one, I could see it jumping back to $280 or staying flat by then. Good luck
Thats as early as I would play it, depending on strike. I think $300 on mid 2021 is pretty safe
Should be Thursday or Friday this week
Anything was thinking January 370c
Some people don't understand how dates work and are selling off because they think that because today is the last day the early investors can start selling today. People are retarded. Milton owns 24% of the current outstanding shares and if his last fake companies are to go from he's dumping tomorrow.
Well the borrow pool is for short selling, they can borrow and flood the market with low ask orders to drive price down. Saw it happen a few times on level 2 this morning. Theyre sweating 

They cant cover their shorts with those shares, but they can try to knock off paper handed bitches.
Ultimately the choice is yours but the sell-off should last until at least tomorrow when Trevor begins dumping. Personally I'm adding to my short position
A hefty 5 grand
its uo 1.68. what you talking about
i've been lurking for a few months and none of this shit makes sense.
selling on the 14th seems rn a bit of a waste. Personally I'm gonna follow daily the stock from the 4th of December. Gonna draw some r/S zones and see how it goes. I still have to choose a take profit price where to sell. From my stupid and very simple fundamental analysis I would say that the 22th should be fine.
obv take my comment as an opinion. Don't come in my house to kill me if the stock fails...plz
App
You holding or selling? Im
Down like 2K
Gotcha
oh i'm fully aware, i've only bought like five options so far. worth getting rid of then?
Thats a good question. I'd be worried about WORK -> CRM conversion  terms honestly.

Theres a good chance people get x number of CRM shares per WORK share and in that case, contracts will also be converted to CRM contracts. I would not want to play with selling options on CRM.

I think weeklies are the move until we get news on the terms. I think this is buy the rumor sell the news anyway, once we get news and IV crushes on my weeklies I am probably going to cash out
thanks bro, indeed profit taking can tank the market but should go up sometime. good luck my friend
Up 50% selling at EOD.
A VER HIJO DE LA GRANDISIMA PUTA TE CREES GUAY O MDLR POR ECHAR A UN CHAVAL DE UN GRUPO???
PUES QUE SEPAS PUTO MARICON QUE COMO TE VEA YE VOY A METER TAL OSTIA QUE VAS A PARECER UN PUTO GUSANO AHOGNDOSE DANDO VUELTAS, ADEMAS DE QUE TIENES UN PUTO MICROPENE COMO EL GUSANO AL QUE TE VOY A CONVERTIR DE TAL OSTIA QUE TE VAS A LLEVAR CHUPAPOLLAS
Yeah I'm torn. On one hand it makes a ton of sense. On the other hand I could have been using this capital to get in on the GME play and other things that could have made a lot more sense.

So while I think it's logical to buy these undervalued stocks it doesn't look like investors are going to value them at what they are worth for a very long time.

Absolutely no idea, honestly all news and DD pointed to a great day today. But, looks like almost everything is in free fall so far. GME, PLTR, bad first hour for sure.
I mean if you had anything since August you'd be up.
You dont need to have weeklies to have lost money today ya dumb fuck.

The entire market is down and you roll in like you know your shit. Hindsight is 20/20

Cat food? After weeks of gains I think I can survive a red day. 
Just followed you. You da man
I agree I play with 5% of my investments in options. They are down 50% all time while the rest of my money is doing great lol
My stop loss was set to trigger at breakeven. It was gonna go at like 22
Me: fucking cant wait for Monday to watch the market

Me on Monday: I mean who even wants to see their portfolio this early in the week?
Haha its hard to resist to be fair
I've only enjoyed the option premium, I have sold deep ITM calls on my shares. I'm safe through a $12 stock price for the most part. I do think this has some room to stay elevated. I'll be buying puts sometime this week for sure though when some of the option premium fades.
Did you buy calls expiring today?  Otherwise you haven't lost anything.
when we have a catalyst. the most anticipated catalysts are: Q3 earnings (12/8) if cohen tries to do a takeover of the company or we get really good guidance, and if not that then Q4 earnings (in March) thats supposed to blowout expectations due to console release, black friday, etc
a whale is only $10k now a days?
i dont think it has any chance in the senate tho.
I guess so
Thats the spice of life, bro
Get some PLTR or NIO and hope for the best. They are about as meme as they come rn
If it touches $20. I'm going to sell my call lol.. Got a 04/12 20C :P
Which ones you got homie
Just got it at 1.20 ayyyy lets gooooo print this moeny baby
you dont need 1 1000% play. you passed the limit so you can do unlimited haha. but pltr, tsla, gme is what everyone is fomoing into today
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

Sony announced more PS5 distribution mid to late December, rumored date is the 14th. GME should skyrocket.
Ok, but you gotta Venmo me half

I still dont understand lol

Edit: ah lmao, gonna start using that one
Hell yeah, dont be like the halfwits here waiting for 10 baggers and have it end up worthless
Np may bill bless us both with some stripe
> retard.

Depends on the state you fucking moron. My county has over 200k people and I got in with 0% down. Eat shit
Yeah I wouldn't buy it either but I don't short shit especially in this retarded market.
so its a rotation out of equities?
REVERE SPLIT
If you want your boat wrecked from crashing into sandbags
congrats
Least I ain\`t no unclebrother from Alabama lmao
So I checked and I actually have MAR puts. Apparently it's different.
Probably some House bill that is waiting to be voted on that would restrict Chinese securities. Losing track
In solidarity I just loaded some 10c for December 4th to go along with my December 24th ones. This could be a meme flavor of the week here if more people start to load up.
Thanks, Buttlicker
My man
Huge company with huge share float. Moves like a snail. Im convinced it can literally cure all forms of cancer and the market would pump it 3% then dump it 5% the very next day.
Take profits was my point.
If you hold for long term the capital gains will be less and you only pay CGs when theres a realized profit. 

Dividends are also included.
Im bullish long term but I think itll pull back before it continues
Be careful out there
Good man
Goat
There's good amount of volume going in that strike specifically and sellers raising the price of the option if you look at the others surrounding it they dont even come close. 

I was just looking and for that option there were x462 -ask at 13.60

But I don't know shit lol
Nah, I dont want to get into any legal advice realm by actually getting into details. Sorry but its something I dont mess with.

But if you do make a shirt Ill probably buy it lol
Good or bad ?
Thanks, yeah most of my positions is shares too because I suspected something like this might happen.

Bought the calls when I was pretty sure things were out of the rough but there hasn't been a single week without 2-3 hit pieces published since the ANT IPO fiasco.


To be honest I have never seen anything like it other than when the shorts were trying to sink TSLA a few years ago.

Everyone takes every piece of information that has nothing to do with BABA but is somehow related to china and somehow writes a headline like "BABA WILL BE DELISTED ON FRIDAY".

So yeah, I'm a bit salty. Massively oversold stock, undervalued to start with, keeps getting beaten down for no reason. WTF.
IMO the dump is technical and not based on the "news". It's been a ridiculous couple of weeks for TSLA and people are probably taking profits
Gone. I have puts but i doubt XI would be that dumb.
Tbf Im close to FOMOing into QS so I feel you
Yeah its even worse. They try and sell games to people with no disc drives and in store when everyone can just order that shit on amazon or ebay.
Im not worried about nio long term theyre going to pick a day and gap up barely red premarket doesnt mean anything
Fuck man, shits going to swing back up, just early morning sell off
Post that loss porn

Noyce
when are you expecting this thing to moon?
Ok thank u sir
Whats the ticker bro
Jan 15 is the date I bought, Inauguration day is on the 20th, so no major news unless Congress acts before the calls exp.
Get Dec. 18 or later calls
yeah but TSLA is a cool company. MSTR is nerd
No idea. ZM is way too volatile. Ask other retards here. The last earnings it went from $299 to almost $400 overnight.
Yup.
Its either going up a shit ton or down a shit ton. Either way money is made.
Ooooo I see, yeah that's dumb. At least make it to 10
This is the way
today, yeah
Doubt it
No, I was talking of Palantir before you. You're welcome.
Imagine being one of the retards who sold this morning!!!
Its barely up
Yeah maybe that narrative can stick, maybe not. What's concerning is that Asia closed out down over 1% today across most markets despite stellar Chinese PMI data. That's more real to me than vaccine Monday, something is brewing.
My spy leaps are green, but it's a boring slow and steady game
Jan 15
cuz its profitable
not a lot of extrinsic value left, so the premiums are cheap. if it prints, it prints hard.
thanks bud ! may we all make tendies and be able to quit our jobs/live a better life/retire early
If you want syphilis. You don't need a hooker, just marry someone. Don't be a dick.
They already have lol

Maybe it keeps running but getting in last week was the smart play, getting in now is risky.
...yes Im telling you that a close below $588 today is signaling more red this week
Because its true. Cars are already a depreciating asset. Add costly repairs on top of that and its a terrible investment. Buy a Lexus instead. Well made and cheap to fix. Or, lease a BMW for a few hundred a month. Something breaks? No problem. Go exchange it and move on.
Lmao the fuck
Yeah thats fine I though you meant you were holding overnight
No DD, just hope
Price looks right
Just grabbed a 590 call for 12/4. Join me brother
Meh.

I expect december to be a red month, but I don't expect any daily circuit breakers.
He's a dummy misusing the phrase pump and dump. You can't pump and dump a stock with this kind of volume, and you certainly can't get warren buffett in on it lmao
Yes, take a look at its 1 year graph and tell me what you think is about to happen to it
The abject denial in this sub of the fact that stonks go down after a hard pump is amazing. As I pointed out in a another comment, take a look at its 1 year graph and tell me if you think it's going to go higher much longer
Parler version of wsb would be hilarious lol
https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3639876-bill-ackmans-spac-moving-higher-after-s-and-p-global-ihs-markit-strike-deal   https://www.investors.com/news/ihs-markit-takeover-by-sandp-global-44-billion-is-biggest-merger-2020/?src=A00220
The only reason it has been discussed is becuase of the mythical short squeeze.   Other than that it's not been talked about much for a while now.
You think buying them at market open would work?
Lmao BABA will dip short term and go up after this calms down. It wouldn't be delisted unless it doesn't fall into regulations after 3 years .
No medicare is for retirees, medicaid is for poor people
Good luck! Ive been watching this one and jumping in and out for awhile. Totally forgot about it for a bit and missed the merger. Fuck me. Now doing the do I get in, or do I wait game
Sell between 10-15$
what's the catalyst? I see massive volume spike, no news...
$23
IV is crazy but maybe
Alright gather around the campfire, ya see

When a stock has almost no volume and the bid/ask is wider than your asshole.. small trades can move the price violently in one direction while not really meaning anything for the actual stock movement
 I lost about $2000 on GME calls in October so I feel you
4200. I'm going in. IDK how tf I'll get out of that shit but fuck it.
Definitely. I'm going in on 4/16 10c, hope the momentum holds up, but if not, no big loss.
Unlikely to reach $1 trillion on this run
Biggest challenge they have is market fit, traditionally their customers have been large(banks, healthcare, etc) customers who pay millions for on-prem offering. They have been working to pivot to offer more of a paas(platform as a service) product to capture smaller implementations. This next year will be interesting to see how this pivot affects sales.
yeah could be, it depends if some company is going to buy it but I wouldn't think so. Too much shady shit behind Nikola.
try calling them if it persists
Works now for Me
I still think it probably will correct some, maybe end of December will be rough but I thought itd drop faster and bought too far OTM, thinking about buying back in closer to ATM

Edit: shouldnt have fuckin sold lol
Same... feels dumb that the one day appl actually jumps $3 im barely breaking even
lets hold hands im staying
As I understand it, Apex Tech actually has a confirmation for a merger. There is just a Letter of Intent for the Microvast SPAC merger and there won't be one until early December at the earliest. The deadline may be extended until like... April?  


Gores was not on my radar.
Happy cakeday, by the way!
[deleted]
what shitty tech do you have bitch

AAPL and AMD on the come up 
I literally bought the fukken top
Their pay is dogshit, only interview Ive ever walked out of. That being said I was 2 years too late. Two of my acquaintances there started the same role 6 months apart and the difference in equity package was over 50 shares.
Fuck yeah
Yeah reading a sentence from their wiki, splunk seems like competitor..
A company valued at 2.5b with 100m in rev... sketch
Thx
Mate, you can probably still buyback:)
Sorry buddy, Im a CRSR poor boy who almost broke even all time then got fucking eviscerated. And Im still holding shares and on all the red days so far its poked 33 with a stick.
Yep! 600 shares at $14, but Im the biggest paper hands I know so I have to figure out how to ignore the red days
At least u get paid big right ?

75k a year right
ty, NET leaps have never let me down, yet
Thats rough. PLTR is a good long-term hold with diamond hands. 
GME isnt a PnD, its a turnaround play. Cohen wouldnt have slammed his dick on the table if he wasnt willing to follow up with action. Even without the possible short squeeze theres 100+% possible upside over the next year.
easily achievable through, uh, selective breeding
Yeah Taylor is not a very good rival lol
Yup
Ok...any news other than just a market wide sell off?

I have been waiting for a dip to go long but the spreads are utter trash.
There should be no advantage to holding a Unit rather than directly the stock and warrants. For example, a Unit is usually something like 1 stock + 3 warrants.  Let's say the stock is going for $10 and the warrants go for $3.  The Unit will just be the package deal and cost $19.  

So no, generally there's no upside or downside to Units, it just doesn't matter, although sometimes brokers charge a fee to "split" it for you when the time comes.  Unfortunately every Warrant is different so it really depends on the fine print of that particular company.  But usually you can consider them like 5 year options, they are slightly leveraged contracts, so some people like them if they really believe in the future of the company.
That you do have to pay tax if your day trade lol
Contribution limit, also I think you're not allowed to day trade.
capital losses offset taxes, in canada it's a lot better than in the the US (3k/yr max)

learn what the fuck your doing before you lose you $2k life savings
Haha Good luck!
I already pulled out some of position (stocks and options) but had quite a nice day
Still holding 3 contracts of $AMD 85c 01/21/22. Expecting those to print bigly.
Won't they gap that shit up before they sell off?
Also why would they release such terrible news about the GM deal the day before they can sell their shares? Seems fishy.
You son of a bitch, I'm in!
Makes sense.  Doing weekly end of month or Dec 18?
Nothing about the SPY chart says rocket in any capacity.
Trevor milton can sell his shares tomorrow. if he does it should tank, but I have no idea if he will. 12/31 20.5p. I never buy puts either I just hope it dies
Sir , this is a Wendys
No the I is a 1 and the V is a 5 so it is 1 - 5 = -4
T s n p
What is humility?
AFAIK VZ is a good value play but not a value guy so my DD is mostly word of mouth from Boomers on SA.
If you're buying puts even more important to understand the underlying information.  Not just the most you could lose, but what has to happen for you to actually make any money.  Shorting TSLA that hard that soon is a risky play for sure.
Mostly I read about that they are bad in scaling profits and that revenue growth has slowed down over the last years. So you gotta ask yourself why go public now, when they did fine for what 20-30-40 years?

But I never did any deep research myself.
Balls of steel... I pussed out at 70
Congrats man
I mean, just speculation 

If it does pass the Senate, even better for call holders
I think so. People haven't got their vacation fix in with covid. Plus the share price is under $45 from ATH. Even without vaccine news to moon, I think it will slowly start climbing. Lots of room to run
That's probably just CalPERS and some algos.
Yea and Im going to sell for 2.00 lmfao
No options available. You gotta buy shares or warrants (if you want extra leverage)
Warrants are boomer options, so they are all 5 year, $11.50c

You just buy them like shares though.

$1.80 is a steal.
130 is a given my friend. Itll be that by dec 18th
No, but theyve been wondering how they would keep liquidity of TSLA amidst all this chaos. It might be a dual-announcement. I dont actually expect TSLA to sell public shares, but they may offer them to indices directly instead.
Kill Willy
Let me know how it works out!
yes

this is applied astrology
I feel you. I swing trade amazon and will just out after a quick 1k scalp and watch it run leaving another 1-2k on the table. Never feels good but I just just into some loss porn to remind myself of what could have happened
The stock is dragnet until Ant IPO which has been pushed off until at least 2022. Wont have much movement until then
hm, you are convincing, and ive seen all of this. But u thought that the market is forward looking. every vax announcement hurt amazons prospects...what you say is logical, but i still see high volume sellers...
smart money (large scale orders) is pulling money from aapl today
damn bro. hope the cocaine helping. positions?
Believe brother and hold tight
Yup. Back in March
Yes, extremely fast dump, too
Haha good luck bro, i just got out. Might put it into GME. But hope it goes up for your sake!
Black friday was a bust for physical stores, most shopping online. That's SHOP.
You might be right.
Its up over 100% in the past two weeks its had its run
Should bring in some gains for sure. People sleeping on this cause its boring and not a 20 bagger
i like your style dude
Which stocks? Most stocks were down throughout the day after open,, except for cannabis stocks and a few random ones
You're probably fine unless the whole market crashes
bro ur fuckin chilling, Jesus fuckin christ, people acting like the stock pulled a fuckin Luckin Coffee, up3% and people ungrateful
Nice, hope you sold today as everyone and their mother knew it was dipping.I bought the duo at $24.5 and gonna sell if it drops under $26.5. Insane to hold overnight
ill dm u for ur venmo sir
Explains the OSU support 
Oh yeah the folks that actually matter lol.
you right
I think this one is allowed
Yea not even thats allowed lol I found out hard way
thanks brah, im proud of that move
Not all in. I just bought some shares at open. Up 2%
You right you right. Maybe its just time to burn that bridge. It was fun while it lasted.
Im down like 5% on mine, but im still confident itll be plenty positive by end of week. Not to mention months from now
Good luck bro.
Lol just don't buy the top 
Dumping right into my fidelity account on sale
I think it will go up all week.
Fuckin blast from the past right there! Damn Im old
you should hold it. the company is legit and has alot of room to grow. plus retard meme status
Not at all.  You must not math.
Congrats! Thinking about hopping onto CRSR after its done selling off. Treated me well on the way up. Otherwise might get in on some FDX calls EOD for earning on the 17th
I did that after replying. Has to be a combination of IV and Theta. That's the only thing that makes sense.
Mad horny for puts yes
Conclusion: you're right
Ah, well you plan on holding or cutting losses? If youre on Tesla honestly just hold until you feel theres no chance. I usually cut losses at -15%
AND DOWN WE GO!
Your response constitutes an inditement.

Either the vote fails and it dips, or the vote passes and there's a sell off from probably another 5-10% pump. It's risky to wait till after the vote though. I've seen APHA/weed dump after positive news events are confirmed.
Its possible I may have acquired it at an inopportune time
this is the way.

all I'm saying is that it's a risky play because there's a chance this thing takes off and doesn't dip back down to these levels again today

You call up Sundial and ask them if you can buy calls. Basically bets on how many new weed phone orders they take for their product. Actually the call you make to them about calls counts as 1 call.
Shares
Yup. Lost 2k not long ago because of those fucks
That is one way to develop immunity, I can't argue with the logic.
I think itll go up by December but a short term pullback is very healthy for the stock.
Theyre dominating with their advertising platform. They make money with every channel they onboard by taking a cut of the ads. Absolutely legendary trajectory and you clods think they are just a tv streaming device.
yea thats what i figured...meh lot about nothing, buy all in 21 or buy 50/50 14 and 21
it will crash after either way, for a merry xmas
you convinced me. I just bought 500 more
Yes 
Calls 
Yea if shitty ever breaks ATH or 20k Riot PT Is like 15-30
Thank you
It was on Friday but I'm sure it's slightly off today. Haven't looked at it yet
Dec 6
smokescreen. trust.
You can only sell calls if you own 100 shares as collateral.

Go 50/50 calls and shares if you feel so inclined.
some autist on this site said I could email and request a waive on the PDT ban...turns out that wasn't the case. It does make one more strategic with their FOMOs and YOLOs.

Ah, got it.  Good luck! 
350 is r/antstreetbets lmaooooooo thats essentially loss porn on a stock that volatile
oh sure, but these aren't being held overnight or anything and i figure the profit is gonna be worth it  


lol +90% now

only if they catch you
Fuck off then, hobo.
You.

GOP Senate. President elect who can veto.

Cool it has bipartisan support, it also has bipartisan opposition in the House. Also it will never pass the Senate.

It's currently legal in 15 states - 30% of the union, not even close to 50%.



Canada and Mexico also have socialized medicine - how's that going in the US?

Finally - 

>The public has overwhelming bipartisan support for legal marijuana.

Since when do DC politicians give a single fuck about what we think?

To be clear I am pro-weed, I'm just not a retard thinking it will happen anytime soon.
Those are leaps. This is wsb nobody buys leaps.
Source?  
Havent heard anything about that
what election?
Alright alright...

You just seemed so.... happy about it being red ?
Go cry about someone elses success on r/Democrat, skum bucket
short interest is still rising, plenty of catalysts in place. Exercise a little patience.
What is the play? Who is dropping?
agreed.  I have physical PM, kept in my gun safe.
Not sure what your risk tolerance is, if you could afford to gamble. Then yeah I guess sell it. Jump in to the memes

With that said, I think Apple is decent hold, so make your own a opinion Im just a degen.


Oh, I eat ass, dont worry
Admittedly, it has had a phenomenal run since its last earnings but I feel like there is still some juice left. I feel like it would have pulled back a while ago if it was going to stop. Its target price for 2020 is $40 so take that as you will.
Why are weed stocks moving again? Biden?
oh yeah thats definitely basic stuff you can just find on youtube by typing those things into the search bar

Also; once educated you will see the comment you made about making your family homeless with options is hilarious to anyone who understands the way option prices move.

No one who successfully trades does so with weekly options, those are the ones that actually go to zero. Options are a fantastic way to gain exposure to a ticker with much less risk and allowing you to create more positions on more tickers increasing probability of success. 

Right now the AAPL 1/21/22 20c has 53 delta, so a $6,148 notional value can be controlled for only about $1,500 right now with over a year to see that price action play out or change my mind on the assumption. Theta is only .0192.

Also; just as a note, once you have 100 shares of something selling options against it is like getting a cash dividend increasing returns on that ticker. If they get called away, you can just buy more shares on the market.

I was just assigned 100 shares of WORK on Friday, I'll probably sell options against them until they disappear.
Be quiet before they catch on but yes anything under 130 is highway robbery but I want juicy calls
Yea what a run tho! From $80s to $120s in a week. Calls up big but idk if its worth owning options on NVAX, the volume is so low
I dont think its applicable in that sense but I see where youre going, maybe you donate to them to keep them from shorting it yes, kind of
Iron lung by EOY bullish
Yeah that is the way to go, I went feb which is hopefully far enough that this shit blows over.
A lot can happen between now and March. Hold strong my brother
Still like Apha although its getting dicey with the run up over the past week.  If you dont mind shares and ETFs, MSOS is good for us exposure, and Yolo isnt too bad either.

Ordinarily I would plug IIPR as well but not sure how legalization would impact them long term.
In that case go buy aapl like a boomer.
I dont think you can really go wrong with any of the ARKs. Pick one or two with exposure to the sectors/stocks you want and have at it
Yup, if I knew more about trading when nikola was falling I would've gone balls deep on puts for Nikola cuz after all the controversy after the promo video I knew it was over

Thought you had shares not options. Good on you for making money!
I just hope you've got some DTE on your positions and are not playing weeklies. You'll be alright. Feel free to send me a message if you need someone to stop you from dumping your calls, haha.
When is it supposed to hit the list? Everyone said it would last time and it didnt. All I know is I got in at $350 so Im chillin
Another comment under your post said this, but its probably because of typical Monday morning high traffic. If the traffic is really high the app can lag and even crash so Id wait like maybe an hour or so if it doesnt fix it then contact their support. I switched off Robinhood best decision I ever made lol.
Sounds like a soft breakup where you say you want to take a break but never get back together.
How low bro... Headed for the 50MA
I know, right? I sold some ARKK calls I had up 200% a few days ago, and kicking myself. Finna get back in more leaps on payday
Oh boy. That must be painful to look at.
Ive been burnt on holding large positions for too long many many times. You just have to accept many small gains are better than holding out for that 10 bagger and losing everything. Ive been just holding shares and wheeling mega caps for two months now and have been doing great, its not as fun but it isnt supposed to be. We are not Jordan Belfort here, that took me way too long and thousands of dollars to realize
TSLA charts dont mean anything so many times it was ready for a pullback and just kept rocketing
Put in the ticker, then manually change the price. Select your option. Change the chart output at the bottom to "option/spread value" and it'll give you the price for that option on each date
Yeah its a great stock to wheel! Got tf out of my PLTR in the morning thank god. Good luck dude

The good news is you are in the NFC East. You will probably make the playoffs if you can win a couple more games
Nah I figured you were jk but I always like to recommend these pouches to people. So much healthier than nicotine products containing tobacco
Everybody started panic selling driving the price down and switched to puts
Godspeed brother  
Yeah but honestly its a hidden gem because its so rangebound and yet a good stock so I wouldnt mind storming and bad weather with it so to speak
you do you!
The uncertainty of what the house will vote is what dropped it. Easy buying opportunity
Yes so it's a easy buy
Considering the volume on all the calls below it Id agree with you, I didnt even look at strikes that high bc $280s had like 15 volume
idk meme stocks tend to die on earnings
Interesting. Thanks for the DD. Ill look into it
Gonna go with 80 contracts of 12/18 35p specially with what nkla did today
Oh then yea, but I mean its pretty normal, volume gets lower in the middle of the day
Volume is always highest at the beginning/end of the day. Usually by a large margin too.
I personally love TastyWorks, I know ToS is popular here. Note, charts on Tastyworks are hot garbage though
I've never had above 5000 so yeah, they'll quiz you and you just have to sound like you know what you're doing, you want at least level 1 options trading (long calls and puts)
What did their reply say? Just no and no other explanation?

What options level did you apply for?

Average account size at Schwab is 300-400k, so $3,500 is definitely on the smaller side for them to start allowing that risk

Schwab is great, but so is TastyWorks - they are a bit more liberal with approvals, just not the best in-client charting.
From 22 to 26? Its got lots of left
Ill squeeze your ass
stop hating and get in
I think MSTR might attract more institutional investors due to the software business (which is also undervalued). It might be a little late but still has a long way to go over the next few months. Would buy leaps if the vol is right.
You are well-studied. Those 91 Million shares are officially OK to sell from Ol' fuck head tomorrow. I would be shocked if that weasel doesn't pack his parachute heavy - that would be another catalyst for a deeper fall.
Nice
its not completely over, could definitely see some more piling in... i dont own a crystal ball and have been wrong before
Yeah but thats assuming it wouldnt rebound. Its a great stock to hold
Thats some shit. I remember shorting shop at 400 thinking it was a giant bubble then. Truly  incrediable
Yes and congress bill threatening delisting
AH gotcha
I looked at their site.

It seems like they're trying to capitalize on the weed hype but idk
Dumb this down for a retard plz
Next week
Well, its target price is 306 and FB is a well oiled profit generating  machine. They have constantly bear earning ex., lead by a rootless terminator a cyborg. And earnings are in January there will be a rally at some piping between here and there. Also dems are pretty lenient on FB, with the new administration oking in.
Thanks, it is up huge this year. Now options are so expensive
???
Thats pretty great, you think itll work out this time?
Thx
tbh i'm just trying to figure out how to short vega, could be super useful in this market. mine is right atm at 465/467.5 475/477.5 for premium, just kinda wanted to see what happens with the iv crush. urs sounds a LOT safer
monthly??
Maybe they thought spy may close above 361
Ive seen this too and wondered myself
Ok sounds smart.. positions? Stocks or leaps?
I don't have any position in Zoom, I'm just rooting against you to be an asshole.
Lol that should tell you everything. He hasnt even gotten one off the ground literally and they are trying to shill another one.
God speed
i was.

i am a futures trader.

Index futures are 95% of what I trade
Thats also definitely not happening. Probably bad news for one of their competitors boosting both of them.

Lol, it doesn't matter just sounded emotional as fuck. I haven't kept up to date with WSB hyped tickers, the way you described your trade will honestly hurt you in the long run man. At least if you're consistently doing this shit lol, there is a reason they tell you not to be emotional and panic at the slightest adjustments.
Stfu Edward paper hands.. Thanks for the buy opportunity retard. Up 47% on 12/4 $28 calls. Thanks

I just scalped it and made $2200

I was shooting for a double up but took the profit and was happy.

Still have large LEAP positions that I have not touched.

So it did age well.
Make the time. It will pay off.
If you search for gme in the search box and go through some of the DD it should better explain it.  Me personally I am going to be getting tsla for the long run and then gme for a short while.   It could be worth getting into gme but would be best if you looked around just to make sure you're happy etc.
Wrong, options are only during market hours
We all draw with crayons here. Read the DD posts, decide their crayon doodles are the best and go for it.
I'm not trying to convince you, just mentioning some reasons why people don't think it's dead. You could also look at the charts. Every time there's a console release, it goes to $50.
So you did not buy puts on the spike this morning.
It will moon once it gets sorted but I think we still have some time to wait. T H C B is a better short term play.
Im just bitter from bag holding shares for 2 months while its done nothing
Lol. Sell and get yourself some cake to celebrate your cake day.

Oh you can lump me in with the people who have enough to learn about that I have not got the understanding of warrants necessary to trade them or explain them myself.

From what I understand though, they have most of the upside and almost none of the downside, just I don't fully understand how/why that statement is true so I don't trade the instrument.
Lmao if you think business travel is dead because the bears at CNN said so then power to ya. I work for a company having to do with mortgages and our business trips are still booked. And when the vaccine is readily distributed to not only those with weakened immune systems, but all citizens likely in 6 months, i think we will see a travel boom like no other. This including in the business sectors who have been saving money by having most of there bussiness's work remotely. I dont have my money in hotels im not a boomer, but to think that boomers arent going to dump money into them using the exact thought process above, then youre tweaked. Hotels arent going anywhere and likely will recover along with airlines that rely heavily on business class .
Still sucks as a company. $0 value imo
oops, forgot you guys dont buy shares. my bad, keep betting on sports
I was vomiting.... down 5k back to even... now im only down 1k
1. Nice! Mine is way lower.  
2. Yes, youre right. At that bracket it makes a huge difference and youre the first I saw to pay attention.
What's Airbnb's projected value per share at IPO?
Barely up from IPO. Took a nasty ride down to $16-17. Earnings 12/07 AH

Its SO easy to accumulate shares on this. Even on its red days it gaps up and then drills to earths core - ample time to sell and rebuy EOD
Nice 16% steady gain is great
You know what happened last earnings right? They went up 40%.

Anyways. God speed dude. You are literally gambling.
Its been popping and it will continue
First your Beavers steal my Oregon -6.5 money, now you attack my karma? Guess its gloves off then

I'm with you my brokerage and 401k are heavy in rtx. The government never runs out of money.
AAPL is a slow mover. Tends not to move up unless there is positive earnings. Idk why its going up today.
Your long in a company that doesnt even have a physical product and is worth 8 billion dollars and your worried about float?


Yes
Thanks for that overview. I bough in at $40 today and am now down over $400 which is somewhat disheartening. Guess Ill have to hold on to these shares for a while
The lesson was take profits. Im still long on PLTR.
The lesson was take profits.
Ouch. I think if your down that much already you might aswell diamond hand it. Most you can lost now is another 10% but theres all to gain
All you had to do was include PLTR and I woulda came
What planet do you live on where 4% daily gain is bad and is there any room because Im not a huge fan of this one
They're down mostly because of delta.

0.39 delta on $30C 12/11's.  Every dollar PLTR drops is -$0.39 on those options.  They're sitting at $1.90 per contract, and have dropped from a high of $4.70 per contract.  PLTR has dropped $4 from todays high, which is -$1.60 per contract, or like 25% of it's lost value.

They're not getting theta'd lmao.  Theta is linear and doesn't get worse if the price of the stock drops.
Hey whats up? Check in soon. Saved the comment 
No but its also been 15 years of a strict no-AMD CPU in every PC build I did. And now in 2020, I've build an AMD gaming PC for really cheap for the very first time and the CPU has a nearly 2x higher passmark score than my 14/28 core Intel server CPU. It also only costs like $150. Ryzen 3 performance is ridiculous and they there also not affected by all these Intel CPU exploits recently.
Then dont invest in it lol, Im long on shares and this company is guaranteed to be a banger so bitch about it all you want and Ill be holding
bro
Um... I don't think you know what a short squeeze is. LOL
Unprotected sex with a one night stand is hindsight? Lmao
Lol its not yours
I got out as soon as it was a positive play. Hope you got out ok.
Mental illness is funny
I mean the last 7 days
You have calls or stocks or both?
Yeah just be careful with weeklies. Sometimes a cheap call like that might end up just dropping to become worthless at 0.01 keep an eye on it and don't get greedy waiting till Thursday to sell hoping for a green dildo.  

Options trading is one hell of a way to play the market but it's extremely volatile.
attaboy    
I have puts in your mom. Get it?
I never get spy puts timing right. Good luck homie

Oh yeah. I was off by 50 cents sorry about that.
Along for the ride.
This. Not even a bear, just nice seeing there's some order in this mess
Pltr chart isnt looking bad tho... just consolidating.. kind of.. which is good considering its kind of a red day... I would look for a re entry.. personally.
I am still gonna buy back in dont get me wrong. Love the volatility on this one
It should be included in the S&P because it is one of the largest and most significant companies in the world. Your 401K just got a nice boost
too early, I think the pullback will happen around 12/21 or 22
Dude. It gained 9% on friday and is up 7% on the day. How is that not bullish for you. ESPECIALLY looking at the rest of the market today
Oh well. Im big time bullish TSM. Trump is dead shit anyway right.
Yep
It's dope af. My bank app my brokerage all have it
I would hold those unless you are in the green and you want to use capital elsewhere.

I'm still in the green but holding feb 270c.
so are you asking if you should exercise it today? if so it would be stupid to exercise at barely 30. I'd wait til EOY
Good luck
Fk i need to start reading into the fking DDs more. Again fk citron.
Are you blind? +13% on nov 24
Id just get it now and DCA as it goes down. Or be glad you got in at the bottom. Win/win
That's pretty fuckin great, good on ya!
can't seem to find that SA article. you have a link?
that's playing with fire unnecessarily, i'd say. im long since $4. definitely overbought big time by now, so you could potentially make money on a short term short back to like $6.5. but. i think this stays around here and then continues to rise into biden.
Now what???? What did I say????
Possibly as early as next week
Oh yes must've clearly been talking about today when it went up 26 dollars and 20 percent 
Pigs get slaughtered...
Extension
I aint buyin PLTR either
never touched it myself actually.
when PRPL gets the military contract, let me know.
You are retarded, but just short it and I'll take those tendies tyvm
Damn thought they were buying AAPL and AMD
I know, I bought in at 18 a share lmaoo, i was telling you that trusting pltr at the end of it ALREADY going green that fast and buying at a peak is on you not the retards here. Edit- positions I have 5 shares but nice try I just lurk here
Congrats. I made money today too, but dont act like you outsmarted the system on a market correction day.
Agreed
Yes
They won't be delisted. They will have to be audited by USA standards now or whatever.
You know you cant take advice from no autistic mofos, but honestly the amount of balls you pack will determine your next action, albeit you are running out of time, its gonna need another epic rally like past weeks. The call is yours, hold and pray or dump and cut your losses. Theta is the weapon of crime, but greed or bad timing/ignorance are the real culprit.
Im happy with 2k this morning. And I mean my kids will lol.
Ive been bull gang since August, just had some fun during March lol
Nice try buddy I fell for your when does the market open post earlier
Wouldn't be a big loss for you. You won't use them anyways your whole life.
Yea imma just $ROPE
No? You posted within a 5 minute span dumbass
haha bro don't ask a question that makes it seem like you're a 12 year old with dads bank account if you want to be taken seriously. You could have looked it up but you chose to embarrass yourself here instead.
No shit. Im explaining what he fucked up on in his UN-covered call.
Whos making the money here? Quit blaming the sub for your inability to make a profitable trade, wasn't exactly rocket science to see PLTR wasn't at a good price to buy calls.
You should have used italics. We like those
Tell me when you reach our 1800% gains pal.
Except they are not if you fucking read what they are voting on.
They are voting to delist those who are not compliant to US regulations, not delist all gyna stocks. And even if its not compliant, it still has 3 years to comply. BABA is already being audited by PWC, the auditors of TSLA.
No there not
And a weeb
Maybe.
Even if things tank with the rest of the market that does not mean the bubble is cracking genius
it might be time to exit.. unsure
Well Its not an actual good play, more of an informed gamble lol.  
There are currently over 100% of shorts on the stock. Meaning that more than 100% of the available stocks will have to be bought back by people who have Puts on it.   
This mean that a shit ton of people are losing money the more the stock goes up.   
They will have to buy back at some point.   
If the price goes up for some reason, like a news release or partnership or massive numbers of WSB retard buying. People might be scared and start to cover.  
In theory this will create insane buying pressure and a self feeding loop of price increase fuelled by shorts who will need to cover.  
This is a short squeeze. In theory this could make the price jumps to insane level.  

To give you an idea. Usually, 20% short interest in considered high. GME is over 120% lol.  

If the squeeze actually happen, current price will look like a joke, if it doesnt, the stock might crash back down.  
Informed gamble
People who bought the dip made money. Not complicated to understand..
Dont say that. Just buy the dips in anything and Jpow will save you
I miss haupt, where is that fucker.
This Isnt The Way
there was a happy school that had a lot of happy students but then suddenly half the students are missing and you really are betting on students returning to school? oh yeah the context that i didnt provide was there was a bomb threat that day
They're literally in charge of vaccine distribution. They should be a 100 stock.
Thanks. Theyve gotten pretty much all calls in the past week right. From penny stocks to big companies. Guess this gives good perspective on the market right now and whats going on.
Always inverse WSB except when the inverse of the inverse happens.

man you sound douchey af
Are you holding GME puts or seomthing??
I doubled my money but I'm still trying to break even for this year lol...so sad
Ride this stupid gme wave but Im holding on to pltr for a year or two on free shares.
WSB autismo pumping momentum is the only thing driving these stocks
Yeah for real... if you have shares youre fine, but calls are 
it totally could be and I'm hoping it is but to me the q4 earnings is the big one

but I hope I'm wrong and we both get taken to Jupiter
ok if GME has an explosive move to 20 around 1:30-2 I'll eat a boot
I'd bet closer to around 1PM We'll see a movement
yep! same man, what you in at and how many shares
dial of the sun
There's black or white but Im not going grey!
Ah makes sense, I thought it was r-word lol
Getting more call the second it starts going up
Nasdaq
Extension is bullish signal a deal is being made. If an extension is granted expect news shortly thereafter
Yes, extending it would be better than calling off the deal
Whos the idiot now
Its ok I sold my out and I had 3 secured puts
We literally have no idea. Only options are scheduled profit taking and / or market manipulation lmao
son of a bitch. i'm in. Just bought another 100. Gonna keep buying some more when some funds settle into my accounts
Tell me about it. All those unrealised gains from Friday AM just gone
If the moon had nothing to do with the market, TradingView wouldn't have a MoonPhases indicator as a default data input on charting....
Its all calls..
Perhaps but its a low risk p&d
No it already spiked in anticipation who knows how much more it will do, it might be sell the news event too we just don't know
You're right. I'm making this hard on myself. PLTR to the moon man lol...
Ugh lucky! I live in NYC. You know how it is here. Shit is so dumb
Absolutely agree
Power hour will definitely be an interesting one
I missed PLTR okayyy !!!!
Yep thats what I thought.

Thanks for validation!
Didnt consider seeing anyone, Ill schedule something fellow autist
Agreed. Thats my plan too although It might take me a little longer due to having a smaller account. Nonetheless in due time, we will reach a millie off Nio long term guaranteed. Not selling and diamond handing this regardless the technicals
Saved me lol didnt touch it
yeah i know, it seems like in the moment i always forget to do that. thank you for the reminder :)
You must be new here
Already have my accounts to be responsible for. Im not gonna risk YOUR money, too. If YOU think the stonk play has merit, grab shares & do options, too.
most def
Hope so Im down 24% on LI
If you need the money for something else, you can sell. Otherwise, nothing changes about BABA; its still the Amazon of the fastest growing major economy on this planet, with half the market cap.
Yea just not sure which date to choose tbh
Smart move tbh
I bought calls for election week and made good money but both ACB and TLRY are on pace to go out of business so really needs to be a good catalyst for me to do it.  Like I know people here are going batshit over the house vote but that just reeks of a sell the news event.
# PUMP IT!!!!!
Lmao dude no worries, I sold my CSP at the very top as well. I have a 27 & 26p. Good luck
My account is going to have sexy time with bears
Quick read tells me they havent decided what to invest in yet is that true or have they?
GIVE ME A T
Yeah kinda just meant those futures didnt matter for my stocks good luck
It may be $10 at open the rate its dropping
Hmm maybe I did lol. I don't think so though, I haven't been active here much this year until recently.
As is tradition
I'm fine, doesn't expire until dec 24th
I was referring to this:

https://tenor.com/search/denzel-my-nigga-gifs
Atheist. No foot rub for me...
man, I hope so!
I bet it does, it put weed in the headlines.

You can rationalize every micro move and come up with reasoning.
Id say thatll work out well
https://inthemoneystocks.com/investors-profit-by-learning-the-three-day-rule/

Profit taking and bad news drops usually come in 3 day windows.
Dec 18th there are options up to $35 strike. Volume is over 4k but the IV is ~180%

Jan 15th and beyond all have lots of volume up to $35 strike with less IV, but remember theta decay will hurt you for any January calls.

There's lots of volume and calls for dates beyond, but only up to $35.

The reason we don't see strikes beyond $35 is because only MMs are writing the calls right now. This stonk just dropped 2 days ago.
I cucked myself, 15 minutes erased all of my paper losses for the day and I couldn't resist at that point. Good job though, I definitely agree we'll see 30 again soon
wanted to be conservative. i still got some theta to burn. it looks positioned to be a 15k play. im ITM by 10% now
really not that bad for that volatile a stock tbh.. last earnings it went up like 40% lol
Youre getting in at one crazy time, man. Ive never seen a market this volatile and Ive been trading for 15 years my first yolo that cleared me out was fucking Yahoo

Serious, man, want to know the secret? Buy and forget. I dont mean in the boomer way, where you get JPM and it goes up a tidy 3% a year. I mean you can buy some crazy shit and ... go away. Easier said than done, but basically set a rule for yourself that you can go to buy but not check balances until end-of-year, youll thank yourself forever.
Agreed
Honestly so glad I YOLOd GME not PLTR today
Yea i mean FR im not selling until like GME 50, most of my calls r pretty long dated (jan - apr) and im holding tons of shares so w/e take ur time GME lmao
Nope. I BELIEVE. plus i need these to print so I can buy shares
Thanks for the DD 
What do you mean? You dont wanna buy tilray 150c for 1/15/21? Lmao
I got in a Lil under 40
That was the rumor. Fingers crossed!
Not holding any options just shares. Robinhood wont let me trade options yet
Why would I? 

It's an event from 2008, super rare, and would likely not happen here.
Maybe with MARA but BABA panic isn't done yet.
Clearly too much
I bought at $8 too sold at $14 a month later whats your point
the premiums will jump as soon as its green
u/dawson3678 Wait, there's more : stike price is 40 
what'd I say
Yeah, I get that they sell different things but its still a relatively shit buying experience I reckon.
Okay thanks :)
Thatll be good too
It's trading at $23.10 premarket because of the news, news ended up being very bad for NKLA because GM is not taking a stake in the company. Think you missed this one boss. There's always other trades though
Yeah same when I get too greedy it falls if I sell it will go up even more. I sold a few contracts when it was at 19.40, might sell off a few more and just keep a couple till friday. I know whatever I decide will be wrong though lol.
it was always a bet for the merger. just wanted to get in at a healthy price. I'd say the loss is worth the potential gain anyhow.
shares. 

I'm not in US so options cost me 2$ a contract
40% is nothing to feel bad about.
Its got 3D renders of a truck that can roll down a hill (under its own weight)
Can you trade stocks and options in a Roth? Im in a TDA Brokerage account.
Yeah, I could see it going to 90 some point next year.
Currently up 400% - to buy or to sell is the question
Are you down
Makes sense. Thanks beavs. 

Anytime you feel like youd short this market?
Fair enough im going to play at least a few puts to try and make some money
???
ur right im a retard, just sold all of them and went all in puts
r/pennystocks
chillout dont act like options are esoteric to learn you retard. even a 17 y/o kid knows what they are
the memes will get ya
Senile has to do with the brain but there is no bone inside the brain. Did someone drop you the day you were born?
Like the same list where huawei is?
Lol not sure if srs
Did you make a profit? If so, good shit. Onto the next one!
Might buy some protection just in case. I got shares
Yes sir! We'll be celebrating soon my friend!

Been diamond handing my puts and watching NKLA take a ride to **Destination Fucked**
That dude just reminded me too much of that Fyre fest guy
Looks like we might be fine!!!!! Fingers crossed. Don't you go and jinx it
I'm bullish on Palantir, but not at 150+% IV.
Check the charts, it was taking a break before pumping up like tesla. Well take your own financial device and do your own DD. Just letting people know who wants to knoe
I would have jumped back in at 550 but missed it. Hope it pulls back some more
I got in at 14 so anything over 20 was fine with me. Just a little bummed is all
From $33 on Friday to $24 today was not just a "market thing". What other 40b+ market cap company dropped almost 30% in that time?
HG1:COM
Yeah I see that. But if youre a pussy and dont want to debate the rope, eod or open is pretty good to do stuff then. Midday trading is too coinflippy for more bears.
Means they better rip the low speed off the printer & blast giant amounts of liquidity $$$ at a high volume to truly wipeout the shorts. Otherwise, selling pressure too great. At least for now.
Yea thats a good entry point. My initial CRSR buy in was $47 so Ive frantically been trying to average down or else Id be next level fucked lol
Yea dw, Im the same ahah
On top of that Vaccine approval and news is imminent so theres going to be a definite sell off
dispensery operator? amazon is a new direct competitor

also it says Cresco Labs, Inc. is a publicly traded, vertically integrated cannabis and medical marijuana company based in Chicago, Illinois, with current retail operations in nine states where marijuana has been legalized for medical use. Wikipedia
Cheers
Ooof. Yeah only 6% tomorrows another day! Keep the faith
Yea I bought 5 more stocks today. Maybe will double down if I see another red day. But Ill look into more long term calls. I smell a deal somewhere in these call options.
Im hoping on $80. Holding until at least then
No problem.
hmm how are you able to see MM net pos/neg accumulation?
Thats sick
i plan to. lol, it's straight up yolo play. only a few calls
Bro theta eat ass
Grabbed some 12/4 $10 see how it goes.
Agreed, I dont even have a full time job yet so Im not quitting yet, just wondering about peoples stories. Should have probably just asked if anyone had started a business.
sorry 12/4c $800.  Volume was around 5,000 and the bid/ask was around $.50 - $56 IIRC.

This is crazy, price down $30+ but my calls are up 24% now
Take a look at the recent PR and pipeline updates. They had stalled on a few items to better improve the efficacy and have even opted for a nasal spray alternative to an injection.

Id hold a bit longer depending on how much youre down and how much you think the market will tank in general
12/4
That's the spirit!

I have accepted this is not a hype stock anymore, minimum time frame 3-5 years for big gains.  Playing it as such.
Calls with 3 weeks to exp
I have no idea what Im doing with that or I would be all over it
got it thanks
Nice boss, I was thinking January 375s. I think its a good yolo. Lets do it! 
gotchu thx
If Im not making 50% profits expect me in your house
I'm holding. Down more than half a grand but I have stocks, not options.
I diversify, so I don't just play BABA, JD, BZUN etc. It's all I matter of style  I guess.
that's not too bad then, my cost basis is low enough to withstand the drops. what about you?

Lets all make some MONEY!
Im still a youngster with a portfolio of 20k at age 18 but at one point I was day trading options making 1k-2k a day until one day it wiped me off the surface of planet earth lmaoo... so Ive saved enough to make 1k a week witch isnt bad... eventually Ill have enough money to make 2k a day off shares
avg share price for me was a smidge under 24
See you're playing this with an actual plan.  

But most of the people in GME today read the short squeeze hype over the weekend and are going to buy in for a week or two.  Well until they realize they can't predict a short squeeze in any reasonable amount of time and sell.
no it expires mid jan
wouldn't be a bad idea weeklies aren't the play for GME
Thanks bro
Bet bro.
If I had any money I'd make this play. Just shares for us poor boys
I had $3300 12/4 calls but then it started falling hard so I sold them and only lost like $200. I bought back in for $3500 12/11 hoping it would hit $3250 by the end of this week or next monday
ur crazy.

we are either ending the year at spy close to 375+ or below 350+ 

if spy is 375 amzn will be 3300 ez
Honestly no clue. They already have mooned since the announcement of being added to the S&P so not sure how much this effect will have. I hate the phrasing but the last week or so may have priced it in

Normally yes. But ill be honest this market has been extremely hard to read lately. Bonds and equities could both rise and i wouldnt even be surprised right now.
Got me bro
oh yea heard about that
Hey man, I hope it works for us.  I need something to get my portfolio going.  Everything is boring as hell right now.
You're right, and a lot of people have lost money on it. My profits are locked, but I am now opening some exposure for the icing on the cake.
The volume at that strike is definitely crazy haha. Thanks for your input though.
Yeah I completely agree with you. Its strange because the US-Sino relations should improve post Mango man. The BABA financials are great and its a solid investment. Its crazy to me how over valued so many US companies are and when theres an obvious value bet no one jumps on it ??
How much are you losing on your puts today?
add me on snapchat.

Guccismith
Got a 21 day ban for it last time. Look it up.
Ah I see, good luck!
Can we cancel our existing buy call which is already placed?? I did it on RH.
Or you want me to do a new call ??
Depends on when you bought
Yeah same. Shares are green, leaps are green but were talking +/- a couple hundred a day max. I guess its better than taking a huge L. Thats what its there for but man does it suck during market euphoria.
True but I still believe there is a good amount of meat left on the bone, im personally selling before the vote tho
Didnt consider a Lexus, hmmmm thanks
i left one on with the house money in case something about this s and p decision causes it to tank (delaying it or whatever)
Im so fucked
Lmao yes you most certainly can pump amd dump a stock of this volume.

Look up Chesapeak Oil, oil stock that went from $7 to $30 in a day and then filed for bankruptcy the next day
Yeah Im not even hearing this guy, been reading DD on this for weeks Im in.
!!!!
It's been listed for 2 and a half months dude. you just don't know what you're talking about. you don't even know what it is. nobody with a brain trades off charts for anything longer than a week move.

I feel the same way but I also sold a couple hundred worth of put credit spreads expiring this week
Good luck to you too! I'm probably going to sell the higher priced one and hold onto the 22.5 in case it moons.
ARKK bought 1million shares.. do research on their ceo cathie.
Mine is a bit lower but Id ride out the fervor a bit longer, think it hit $28 pre
When has IV stopped us retards?
I see, thanks. If they pull off the cloud part (the spotlight can help), the software side of the business alone could be in the 10-20b range.
Yeah for me as well now
dont leave me brother, i dont want to be alone on this ride.
Hope you fucking stayed strong. Thanks for motivating me not to be a paper hand bitch. Here's to a speedy recovery!!
Thanks! Oof its been extended till April? I thought it was until 7th of December. Guess I got to hold it till then. Im just kind of jealous that the other SPACs are really lifting off but there is little traction in TH CB. If it takes that long I can assume that impatient people will sell off causing the price to drop even further
Shambles mate. Need to get a grip of themselves. Thankfully I only wanted to check my total, I'd be fuming otherwise. Doesn't inspire confidence for the future though
Bruh the whole nasdaq is falling you dumbass fuck your boomer apple shit
Oof. Dividends are still healthy though. If you got xom's last quarter it's not as bad right now. It's like my GEO shares. Already got a healthy yield so a -15 paper loss isn't so bad.
I would assume its like that during most startups / growth stocks

You just have to basically suck it up and believe in the company

I heard the stories about Tesla . Their pay has been shit for years. But can you imagine the equity compensation if you sucked it up?
Their P/S is notably lower than both of those comps... 

Thats SaaS for you. High multiples
Good faith violations. It wasnt worth it lmao
Im not mad tho I wanted to free up funds to yolo spacs I know nothing about
Yea Ive been slowly averaging down from when I initially bought at $47 on its meteoric rise. Now averaging at $39.70. Some fucking fall
Youre about 30k too high lol. Its a decent Wisconsin wage but still trash im and i debate daily if its worth it.
yo our usernames kinda weird
Oh okay thought you were being sarcastic. I think the big dump today is due to the announcement about warrant redemptions
Thanks! I appreciate your help!
Lmaooo
Thanks man
Honestly even if they could pull that off, who cares? I held puts through the fake pump to 34 or whatever knowing this bitch was going down. Just buy 2 weeks out and ignore it
I think GM fucked em. NKLA scrambled and immediately filed to offer 53.4 million shares after the announcement and another 23.9 million linked to warrants. Everyone is trying to get out. They know what's coming. The problem is that there is no possible news to grab new bagholders.
Probably 18th. 14c. What about you?
It bounced twice of 359.5 - there is nothing bearish about that chart - we have short green candles = grind straight up.. Wouldn't surprise me to see green by close easily
not even on my damn broker
Only a small bet, but thought that money was gone. So good to see
You in on it?

4 the vax news is going to have a dip in relevance before having a real effect on AMZN as people realize it's still a long ways away and we are still breaking hospitalization/infection/death records
i tend to follow the options flow, i have more success there. but we'll see!
Had 12/4 spreads on tsla amzn nio 

12/31 calls on baba spy qqq aapl shop

Some longer dated calls as well including spy leaps

And an assortment of shares in a bunch of companies 

Been restructuring a bit since the low point of the day so Im not up now as much as I could have been but I clawed my way back close to even now
I got a 60 call today at 1.70 because I thought we were rising from the grave. Im holding but Im worried
well got shares... not playing options on this lol.
lol funny how I got out of GME to get into ACB lol
seems too obvious to not have been priced in
Netflix
Thank you kind stranger
I did not sell today and its back up. Suck my dick lmao
Hey! We beat the ducks okay!
 shit, less than 10% of retail will ever achieve such a profit
Good luck
Definitely thanks! Holding thicc  as well!
lol you clown
Narrator: That was the day they fell in love
Your joke is going over my head. 
what else can they do?
Thats dope. So I guess I was right about you being an attorney?
Yep.  It's why when I see people claiming they need 250k for a downpayment I'm thinking thats a house where I live.  A decently sized one on half an acre of land.  Actually that price is high to me.  I'm waiting for the prices to drop closer to 100/sq ft.

But once more people start realizing this, and they can remote work, I think there will be a lot of migration to more inland cities if it hasnt already started.
It is always something to not pick back up.  If you are having issues with that, you should contact loved ones for help.
Hes just relaying news bro sorry your puts expire this week 
In it for the long term so really shouldn't even look at price but thanks for the advice.
Actually thanks for the advice.  Just dumped my position when I saw was up like a little less than a dollar a share cost basis wise.  Don't like how far gold can fall as shown by the last recession and good to keep some dry powder anyway because things could break a number of ways this winter.
Hmmmm this might be a good point. 
it's a decision. the context is there dude you're just being a pedant. the decision on how to structure its inclusion.
up 600% on the year here, thx little guy!
Amd hoe

TO THE MOON COMRADE. We buying them shares.
Yea for someone that sold all his holding of PLTR in the morning, and re-investing them with stock/options in RKT. I am totally satisfied with my returns as on right now, People are getting burned on PLTR. I will be a little bearish on my contracts with your new outlook, but I think this stock all ready got hit badly for the past few weeks. I think people are realizing its value. EBIDTA is crazy for a mortgage company, guess it makes sense when you take a old process and digitalize it into a APP.
[deleted]
Ah oke, ik Plus500, ik sell TSLA puts, gewoon houden tot expiry, zou wel value moeten verliezen. Kan je bij de Giro zelf je opties schrijven? AEX shorten kan wel, ik volg vaak de market tho, predicten is te risky. Behalve bij Tesla, die gaat toch omhoog.
yes
Its only 200% and 6k gains. Not really post worthy tbh. Plus sold most of it near highs
LOL my retardedness is confirmed!

Wonder how many people will be making the jump to the new systems. Lots hopefully. Just bought their new base and vinyl player for xmas, can't wait to try it out!

Oh. The sounds like gambling. See I am investing but trying to offset my losses on things like Nio and charge point but doing a small amount of penny stock day trading. Last week I made about $80 off Borrdrilling. Right now Im prob going to make $300 off sundial. Just set a stop loss at this profit level. 

Why are there so many banned tickers on this sub. I thought this sub likes going for broke but charegpoints ticker and sundials are both banned. Im confused but his sub lol
They start green thanks to USA pump, then slowly bleed red along the day. Always the same
Wow and yet... THEY'RE STILL LOSING MONEY


God it's going to be so great when this bubble pops and your dick is hanging in your hands and you're wondering how a -340 PE stock could go red for a day
That's nuts. Yeah mine is up 63.43% ytd since Friday. Mine also probably a little bit down after today.
What are your biggest positions?
I just put it all in March calls. Hope I didn't fuck myself over 
FOMOs and YOLOs is the only way!
 
Its actually profit you absolute retard
Thats a serious bet for GameStop, good luck
They always do.
I'm as god made me sir
Im saying within a few years, not a few months.

Edit: and it has overwhelming support in the house, its expected to easily pass.
The presidential election
Haha there it is. Long $ROPE.
where do you get the latest short interest? quick google search gives me monthly ones.
Use OctoShop in chrome
I thought 50 lol Im just curious if there could be a rug pull today given its ran so hot however we have thag meeting dec8 I thought on them to legalize weed?
Thanks for being so helpful. I do sell covered calls on stocks in my portfolio that are flat. I dont understand options enough to not bankrupt my family, but yes, I agree that with more knowledge they can be smart investments.
Heard that, I may get more if we get a decent dip on open.
Amazing run, I think youre right, I own calls but I'm at my strike and I am going to book profits because the volume is so low I don't want to get stuck, I might roll forward some calls if there is a decent dip though! I think it will have a good run if/when they release good news!
trust me I'm crying shit out of eyes. I am a rookie and I'm still in demo cause I want to actually learn how to make it but when I have good calls like this I always think why I haven't put real money in yet.
brutal

$11c in January
Same same

Do my research . Buy my options on a stock with insane momentum , get out in 5-30 minutes if I make 30-50%

Why wouldnt I sell in 30 minutes if I made 50% hypothetically? 

I guess I have to assess the level of momentum and news of a stock, but even if some company says they announced the cure to cancer I feel like I would still sell for 50% gains because of the mindset I have
Same chart as SEP 1.
I have to imagine the house will vote to audit the Chinese... Why wouldn't they?
I get no respo, I believe I applied for level 2 (spreads, condors, etc.) unfortunately Im stuck with schwab because of my job
Im gonna buy its gonna hit 26 and then die
Only if Stripe
hey
into a company that is completely redundant and makes money by ripping off boomers?
Thanks, man. I was thinking about making a second blue-chip portfolio. But it looks like a fun one.
Yeah some people like to sell before they lose too much and then re-enter at the better position.
:/
I mean, so am I 
Is NIO OTC as well?
Thanks, lots of good points. :) Ill see what the premium is for that position.
Afraid my 12/18 285 will expire worthless, which seems like it will...
well i'm down 10% on these calls, so no sweat for now
Gotcha, yeah Im gonna go super wide and see what happens...good luck!
I've got 175c Jan 15
seems like an overly negative assessment, but thanks for the opinion
well I like how it just decided to make a 2dev VWAP run just for fun after sitting on VPOC for 3 hours EOM
Other then M1 chip bursting in flames or NVIDIA closing ARM I don't see any other options

Because I looked at the market and realized that PLTR being green wasnt going to sustain I sold...

I'm not using fucking emotions im using common sense...
Lol okay buddy. Just remember when you go to sell your dogshit. Its gonna take 5 years to sell because everyone knows you have a time bomb on your hands.
Ive never been good at judging Tesla bro.
my box only has green crayons
Dont worry Ive got more in THC with an avg of 10.69, thoughts on GIK as it seems promising?
I meant G I X actually the lesser known one
You and me both bro. While I hate not making solid profits, it hasnt lost much either. Its been like putting my money in a CD. Selling covered calls to make tendies.
Bro I did that with my ETSY spreads that  wouldve been $250 each and fully ITM but instead I closed way early for $4 each and i hate thinking about it
The downside for warrants is that they expire or the spac shuts down and that would make the warrants worthless. But in the case of PSTH, those prospects are fairly unlikely, which is why i think the warrants are overpriced...but im not sure on what the fair value for the warrants should be lol
Was down 17k and was buying when down that much :)

Was interesting lol
Another $1 up and I will be up for the day.
Read an article saying 50 billion but I think 40 billion. Average share price suppose to be $85ish. They are increasing valuation by close to 25-33%
Thank you for the advice
If I win I'll venmo you 1%
Whats your venmo
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Go Beavs!!!
Good point. I might pussy out and sell early for small profit
No bro I dont have NKLA positions but people have been talking about NKLA and float, just wondering
I hope you have shares so youll come out positive in the end
My i7 shit my i5 machine is more than enough for any game out right now. i9's are over priced and more of a meme than anything.
Clearly you dont belong on WSB
Yup, sold most. Hanging on to a little.
There u go again
Stocks. Too low to make much on calls.
Thank you for the solid advice, it's greatly appreciated.
Just wait for big top on spy and get a lot of time  debit spread Im happy with 50%

Watch the news
I guess we will see lmao...long day left
I am too, just trying to warn people with weeklies.
It's a boutique car company. Just like Land Rover, Ferrari, Bentley, etc., somehow priced like a tech company, but does not scale like a tech company. If you have all of the latest and greatest technology in the world, but keep that technology to yourself and package it in a car, you are just another car company and your car sales are all that matter. Why even bother with the accounting tricks to show profitability if they are a "growth tech company"? Because at some point, the numbers do matter.
People are selling for quick gains.

 Ie. Pltr
What he said, but Ive got 2022 leaps, so its a bit rosier here.
Its a limit order. If it drops
To $27 a share it automatically buys.
thank you sir, i will let you know how it goes.
At least you didn't sell 5k in options Friday morning at the bottom that are worth 30k right now like me. Fuck me.
Started end of day holy fuck you are a troll.

If weed were legalized tomorrow in the USA Id say APHA is one of the best pot stocks to own, but it wont be legalized federally anytime in the next 4 years. Biden wont do it and neither will McConnell. Legalization will only come through states.
So a weekly?
Then drop me some tickers so I can do the DD
Janitorial companies get gov contracts who gives a fuck.
How mad are u
How mad are u
a 5 min refresh is a lot of comments to read bro... u need someone to talk to buddy?
Taken seriously on WSB? What does that even look like? As I said, you're a dumb ass. Next time, try answering the question instead of swishing cock-cream about your jowl, cunt.
There was no uncovered call to begin with, fucktard. READ.

My plays are green  feeling consolidation til ur calls expire
Oh I see I get it

I however am too poor and too much of a pussy for that gamble but good luck.
W-what? Are you talking about in the future? I bought the dip, but the day aint over. Now its $26 and Im certainly not a millionaire.
We pray 
Guys trying to change the market against the market makers...
The other half will be missing permanently when it turns out the bomb was real
Vaccine...distribution? Does PLTR have delivery vehicles now? Is papa John's and domino's gonna be assisting them as well?
Salty?
I think this earnings will be great. Look at every other retail stock that reported recently. They all smashed earnings. Pent up demand has caused earnings beats, leading to short squeezes in every retail stock I've been watching. Party City, Kohl's, Macy's, Nordstrom, Footlocker. I think GME will be the same. Every time I've been by a gamestop, I saw people walking in and out. They also have "now hiring" signs on the front window in quite a few stores I've observed.
sounds good to me
totally possible
Think my average is like $12 a share and I got like $9000 worth or so
I think its both
Same trying to find this dip
Got it
Well lets hope it goes back up!
son of a bitch. IM IN! shifting some to webull to get warrants. rh is a cuck
my ps5 came and went in the blink of an eye
So you think a technical analysis / charting website dictates if moon phases have a direct correlation on the market? Youre really reaching now.
volume is probably going to be pretty insane
No problem friend!
No shame in it, my account is small too man!
Not about the amount of gains, whats more important is the percentage. Gotta start somewhere to get to the top
did you secure gains?
Yeah, won't be holding APHA for too long either... already saw that shitty movement with biotech stocks that got sold off right on FDA approval.
Nice lol
Not yet. They ipo'd like 3 months ago with a NAV of 20 bucks. Honestly I'd sell puts to get in at 22.5 and not buy in now, because I think this pump will fade but it should pay off long term
Teeeee!!!
It willl trend up later then moon soon
hey this is a family friendly christian forum
you can get one from jeffrey epstein in hell
100% 

Cannabis has also been in a downtrend since Canadian legalization. Its getting a little more hype behind it now.
Thanks! In with 200 shares
You are right. I see it now. I'm used to buying OTM calls
I might just do that man. I bet most traders do what I do and check as often as they can I bet it will do me some good putting my money and just leaving it then check it once a month or so
Yea Im selling my Jan calls before ER cuz of IV crush, will buy april calls after ER to be safe, still holding my shares too
Shit works dude. When all weed stocks rise EVERY option contract rises as well. It obviously isnt going to hit 150 but will rise in a positive % for a little bit.

Its day trading, bro
And when the contract disappears when the stock drops I buy more at 0.01.
Im basing this all off hype. Which is the perfect scenario. When Biden is officially in office shits going to rise & will continue to load up.

Cheap ass shit but does the job.
Same here. Top of the rally
This is a sub full of 16 year olds using their fast food paychecks to buy stocks that other internet strangers tell them too
yea and I bought at $8 and will sell much higher than what you sold at. My point is Im not a dumbass shill and Im actually being legit, its a good fucking investment. All the GME bears have theyre heads in their asses and still think its a dying business.
Well hey maybe it works out better for yall tomorrow.
Yep. Best deal there is, which is why its capped to $6000 contributions a year. You can take out principal anytime, but gains only after the account has been open five years.
Don't have to tell me. I'm in with 200 shares since 17.36
Insane
Affirmative

Happy cake day!
I don't short because (). This is the most bearish I've felt and I'm still 60% long

Totally serious. This is WSB, aka a casino.
I did bought last week at 0.74 sold for 1.43

Still holding 2 6/18/21 120 leaps
may not happen today or this week, but if price stays up it will happen, and the more the price stays up the more violent the burst when it happens.
Even if it dips $3 I'd be a happy man! This company chugs cock
I'm formally educated in finance and have been doing this for a decade now... This is straight horseshit 
I got in at 14 and got out at 20.

Imagine how I felt when it hit 30.
Thanks!
Aaaaaaand it's gone
yeah Cresco Labs out of Chicago. Access to banks and common rules across the states will simplify their business model increasing profitability.
Using deduction Mr Sherlock, deduction !

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/PLTR

The shares aren't been used to short, because they're being accumulated.
I haven't, but that's mainly because I'm lazy. I'm content with my job and trading on the side. Best of luck to you!
maybe the IV went up that much but I doubt it, something weird oh well
WSB is a casino. Get out while you can lmao
Im worried there will be a rebound and ill miss gains, stranger things have happened
You don't understand this sub.

Edit.. only been commenting here a month,  proof in da puddin sugar  
R u dumb? Theyre going to be solely specialized in the market holding a private sector in the tech biz, put a reminder on my comment for 3 years and come bitch abt it then
Not down, still about 20% up but getting nervous but pretty much playing with house money now, took some of my gains last week
Shouldve went for a longer date dude. Like December 18 or later
Smart call. Best of luck, I reckon it will deliver in 2022.
I think you will be fine, otm calls?
I have stocks too. Yea Im just gonna hold see how it does but as soon as I make
Some money on it
Im out
Fairly low, Im still about +800 on PLTR, but it isnt fun seeing it take hits like its taking. Of course youve gotta be prepared for its volatility, but, drops like this are just tough to watch. Friends and family going to be feeling it after going in a lot later than me as well.
Says the guy who gets off on people losing money. Lol. 

Zero friends.
Tsla dropped a bit. You think it continues to drop this week? I got in on on the first dip 630 12/4
Then you're good.  Even though everybody on here said April expiry and you didn't listen lol I'd sell them before earnings on the 8th and buy april calls after the earnings dip.
I'll say it out loud. I got greedy because I'm new to this game :(
Yeah if were talking shares, you can do better elsewhere. Might I suggest GME
true
Bro fuck all the hate I`m a flairless retard! Lets make some money
Blackrock, Vanguard and Morgan Stanley are all in it and increasing their positions. It's US retail investors that are selling the stock.
Because the market cap is so large institutional ownership while large doesn't dominate the stock so effect of retail investor fear is more pronounced.

I really think it's just panic selling that is going on more so than anything else and once all the negative news coverage stops it will go  up just fine.
Im not in yet. Waiting for you retards to peak this thing to crush down...just like nkla.
Na dude you post that shit to WSB and let us all laugh at you. Unless your afraid
Got it ty
If its not really filled, then you can cancel and replace the calls
That's why I ignore the leaps and play other memes on the side
I have an F sport trim RX350 and I love the car. Bang for buck
We all are 
you don't know what a pump and dump is dummy. a stock going way up and way down is not definitely indicative of a pump and dump dude
Big down after a pump like this
Yeah anything weekly is super risky rn. See what happens Wednesday and then make your play.
I heard about ARK & Cathie bae, thanks mate
Word... thanks for the advice!
I mean Ill probably get it on it too fuck it
Its possible, there are a lot of competitors in this space. But they do have some IP that no one else has. This product basically lets you overlay intelligence into any application or website; https://www.microstrategy.com/en/hyperintelligence
No, it's not confirmed for April - I just understand that it COULD be extended.
I DONT FUCKIN CARE ABOUT ANYONES POSITIONS BESIDES MINE YA DUMB BITCH!
meh, its a small portion of my account, i didnt go crazy with it, ill probably unload this shit end of day, fuk this casino market

im probably gonna stick to just playing the sector rotations and swap between SPY and QQQ
To be invested in CRSR is to suffer :/
Fuck ... tell me what degree u had to get to get it 

And well at least your not breaking your back doing construction hehehe 
Im almost high enough to think its a glitch in the simulation. Good catch.
Yeah I'm holding some 35p I bought Tuesday on that pump. Just surprised they would pump that shit before the share lockup ends is all. Eveyone selling today makes me want to buy
Yikes I didn't know about the new offering. Good tip.
I got about $5k worth of calls on it. Its a bit of a pussy play if you're horny for weeklies, but I think it'll yield a moderate amount of tendies
positions! I used to be jacked to the tits in long calls, hurt me
I feel like thats a lagging indicator most of the time (especially at the beginning of the week)
Thinking the same haha, how many shares did you grab at what price?
Hopefully it works out for the both of us haha, maybe i should diversify and just hop in both.
When the headlines are printed, it's real
I bought my first lot at $11 and bought more today at close. 1k shares atm
Too bad you coulda sold at $30 and bought back in at a 20% discount 

Still $3 lower than your original post LMAO 
no software
considering i'm not even 2 decades OLD ... okay bud.
That was a good choice brother, I wouldnt go long in gold for a while
Markets still red ya salty boi. But since your dad never said it, Im proud of you for having 2 green stocks today. 
Ahh I see
Your future not mine bubba
in for 2500 shares at 15.5 LFG
rkt HAS to go to at least 26, probably way more, but the issue with this stock is timing when. After a huge waves of good news it either doesnt move or goes down. That is why I personally wont dare to time it anymore. Just long.
But will stonks go up or down
Tsla kan niet alsmaar omhoog gaan he. Upside is  klein op korte termijn imo. Weet niet of ik zelf opties kan schrijven, is ook aardig riskant haha

Twijfel nog een beetje over die short positie op aex, zou vast wel goed zijn om mn portefeuille te hedgen
ok
Damn. Still a great trade. I had my doubts. GG
haha, no worries, I bet you were like, why is this asshole talking about the PS5..

anyway, enjoy your music, haha
Whats the upside? Haven't heard of it, but I'm retarded enough to play penny stonks
We dont like to make money here.
Q3 had positive EPS and theyre exponentially growing revenue. Agree with you about a lot of these companies but Roku I can see bringing everything together, flipping the switch on their plans, and making boatloads of money a la what Facebook did back in the day.
I have a huge position in AAPL so mine is likely up a bit
AAPL, TSLA, PLUG, BA,
March calls youll be fine. FYI you can still sell calls against your position. Just make sure theyre above your long strike and a closer expiry.
Cool - literally no one here cares what's happening years from now.
uhhh wasnt that a month ago
Yep. There it is. Look how long it is, you wish yours was this long. But youve been cheated. Cheated by your father that takes shots of estrogen
MORE Act is going before Congress this week. Then it has to pass in the Senate, which I am very doubtful of as Do Nothing Mitch and gang still run it. Short term boost to pot stocks if it passes Congress but it won't lead to industry explosion everyone is hoping for. Notice that while other pot stocks have floundered, GRWG has continued to grow over the past month. It's a company that sells growery equipment and has been expanding. I'm more interested in GRWG because of the states that recently have legalized, especially NJ. GRWG is looking to set up shop there, meaning itll be getting revenue off of NJ, PA, and NY. I honestly believe it will be a $60 stock by June 2021
I increasingly think not everyone can really understand options - i think it just takes someone who is semi-technical and likes to dig into moving parts and understand definitions.

There is a fantastic talk on how a portfolio can be built with only options/futures strategies but still be sane and not just gambling away money.

https://youtu.be/TyUuB7z8z3o

That one is more specific to Options, might be best to start there
Here's hoping we see a v-shaped recovery, boss.
Better safe than sorry my guy. I sell for 5-15% gains on option plays, profit is profit. I have that written on the wall next to my monitors
Lowest it can go is 20, cause of the SPACs value. Highest is 80 if merger is good and gets lots of hype. Calls seem perfect.
What?
they going online/ are already online. If u so sure its going bankrupt, get some puts
Thats pretty good timing if you were able to do that today. The rebound was pretty quick
       
Baba needs to fucking chill man... holding 12/18 285
you too brother - lmk what happens at open if you remember im genuinely curious
Im only negative on SPCE because Ive been following spacex for a long time and have seen what they have done and not compare but at least see what is capable of being done.  I just dont see SpCE doing anything with space tourism. As for his other ipo I havent heard of yet
Neither of them would sell to the other, and neither of them have the cash to buy the other. Its an impossibility at this point in time.

Oh and good work on t c h, I got there at 11
Yeah I sell 3 contracts a week and make about 80 bucks or so. Not awful. Ive lowered my cost basis under $20 doing that.
RIP
Solid, looking to throw 15% of my portfolio into this.
Still positive, and yes only holding shares. You & I know how this will play out, just a matter of time now. Very bloody today across the market ...
"My old CPU is all I need" has nothing to do with Intel vs. Amd when you need to build a new PC in 2020. Like I said I hated AMD and gave em a chance and the Ryzens are surprisingly good and they are much cheaper than Intel, they are faster than similarly priced CPUs, they use less energy. We are talking about a $150 CPU here and not some over priced intel i9 bullshit.
I just open a $500c calendar spread 12/4-12/11. I can never really trust the options calculators, but these look juicy
These things are not black and white. Yes, it doesnt scale as easily as a FB or a PINS, but it produces its own autonomous software that scales reasonably well as a service. Leveraging tech to build cars doesnt detract from the tech being used. As it turns out, the car industry is massive. Even bigger is the need to produce more sustainable cars. Tesla is leading that charge and will be dominant because its tech is unparalleled. Why you want to put Tesla in the small box of boutique car company is beyond me.
Wont matter just a minor bump
oh my bad i'm still waking up. depending on the dumps today it may get there, was kinda hoping for like 32 EOD
I'm gonna say it exercised lmao
Ive been in MRNA calls since 78, rode the whole way up. Only in shares now
got it, thank you!
AMZN. Unless youre poor. If you are I got nothin
Try: got on, saw your comment. Went and made some trades, came back and saw your new one. 

You sure youre not the pathetic one? Bragging about nodding (which you clearly arent)? Id bet my LIFE that youre under 20 years old.
No thank you, CRAYON EATER
I mean my plays are just fine. Im down on a red day but way up overall so not sure what youre thinking. As far as calls expiring, I only have 1 set of calls left that are for January and theyre doing just fine. I might bail if market trends red for a few weeks but I am way way up on them so at best Ill leave money on the table.

Also the only trades Ive lost on were high risk low entry. I havent lost lots of money, but Ive made plenty so far
Look at me. We are the market makers now.
ok citron shill
Logistics. With the temp monitoring and all that jazz. They'll probably be keeping record of who has received it too for contact tracing.
salty??? I'm doubling my entire portfolio as we speak...my portfolio is 1k tho dont laugh
if they could crush this quarter that would be fantastic and I have noticed retailers doing surprisingly well so It's not farfetched at all. Praying to Ryan Cohen and the GME gods every day
You were right about the explosive move but it's downwards not upwards :)
nice, ye my avg 11.99 with 16.5k share lol, just waiting on it. it can spike whenever!
Aw crap watch me catch a ban now
Ouch

I would like to think so
nope looked away for 30 minutes. im so dumb and bad at this bro
Eh I have been in and out of Apha for the past year.  Buy calls when it dips down and then sell off when it gets frothy like now. Wheeled some puts few months back so I have shares at around 4 that I sell covered calls on.

Think this run might have some legs because they didnt run up the same as others did for election.
GIVE ME A R
Yeah not really worried, its shares so can watch the red light for a while. Luckily Im in pretty deep on GME just need this to break The shorts back 

Of course May end up holding those shits forever if shit goes south 
Burn 
Thinking the exact same, gonna trim Jan before ER
Holding?
I bought and sold for a short term gain as I dont have strong faith in any brick and mortar retailer, but I definitely acknowledge that theres an argument for GME as a value investment. IIRC they did a debt restructuring recently, and obviously they have a lot of real estate. Do you know their enterprise value?
Understood. So basically I just need to open a Roth and transfer 6k to it now and 6k next year and move my portfolio to a roth to help with taxes next year,
Eh, meant to keep or sell\*
Thanks and hope you get out of the red
Cmon bro
>especially a loss of mental faculties.

Bruh, from your own fucking definition
How about the following: If AAPL hits $135 by close on Friday, you buy me 10 shares of AAPL, if it doesn't hit $135 by close on Friday, I buy you a share of PLTR?
Good job retard, loose your money
I feel that man. Cheers to us for the gains though
NP didn't realize that is a legit symbol lol.  By the way sounds like reason copper is up is due to a minor short squeeze.  Far from an expert on the metals.

ok. since when are you bagholding?
Yeah - looks like a double top from a TA standpoint, though
Thanks bro gl to you as well.
Yah I have no idea.  I glanced at the IV but wasn't too concerned due to how far OTM the calls were.

I wanted to sell to close before the market closed but my wife said hold.  She's been right more than I have lately so I'm holding XD
Im thinking about pulling out since Ive only got a 100 shares at 18.6, but i sure as hell dont wanna miss the squeeze . I sold my thcbee to rotate into this, hopefully GME pumps before thcbee so i can rotate back again to catch the merger is confirmed
You want a screenshot? Fuck you
Boomer stonks bad
How are you not down
Good luck to you too fellow redhead
Yeah dipped from 51 to 43 and I loaded 50c then it did what you see now
Same. I bought it thinking it was a good long term investment but this got me spooked. Good luck!
i got out of PLTR a while ago, im mostly in apx-t / thc-b and my average cost is pretty low. i agree with you, whoever FOMO'ed last week is going to feel this drop.
Truthfully, its hard to say. We have some interesting dynamics at play here. We have:  

Tesla (TSLA) secured approval to begin selling its Shanghai-made Model Y sports utility vehicles in China, Reuters reported. 

I don't see why this news would effect TSLA but its related to China and market is moody rn:  

"The House is set to vote on bipartisan legislation that would impose restrictions on Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges, including requiring certification that they're not under control of a foreign government."

My trading style is to not hold anything overnight unless its a leap or a straight up lotto play. 

IMO, 569 ish is support of uptrend channel and it already broke this morning and quickly recovered. If we break through again and test the heavy support at 554 again I'm expecting a break to 534ish. BUT, the line in the sand is really that 569 mark. If we bounce then IMO we will be up at least until wednesday when the house votes on the legislation. Hope this helps. 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/16t64Dm7/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/16t64Dm7/)
okay that is fair. hopefully we get another little bump before the 8th so i can unload without taking a L. bought jan because april has really high premium
that's alright takes experience to learn
I think I might have missed the GME train. I'm just waiting for our next meme stock to hop on at this point.
And i routinely fuck my cousin!! Lets make this money man!!
Been here since March, I've seen a few. I've played PSTH and been burned by it before. Let me ask you why think it's going to keep pumping?
>a stock going way up and way down is not definitely indicative of a pump and dump dude

Lol so you cant rule out it's *not* a pump and dump.
Walks like a duck, talks like a duck....
Fuck its dumping so hard now lol
It shall have its time, Im sure of it. The thing is undervalued for sure, it just needed to calm its previous trajectory to a more organic one
I only have a high school diploma lol. I worked in a retail bank branch for several years and then was able to get in.

MEME stonks are the way! both ACB and GME holding their gains well today! another pump tmr. Going to sell on the Gap up/blow off top
Ive doubled my portfolio and plan on holding this for years.

Nice attempt at trolling that clearly backfired
I can tell by your comments.
Thanks again.  Lot easier to do with gold when there is no dividends or yield you miss out on by hit and running.
Ahhhh made hella on them 
Hell yah man.
Do you think its worth playing leaps on this?
Ja true op beide punten. Nouja gewoon hopen dat het weer omhoog gaat.
The upside is that its cheap and benefiting off of the weed pump from the larger players. Probably not a good hold long term
Thanks for your insight, appreciate it. Time for me to dig deeper
Nice. 
I'm 22% in NIO. Been buying shares since it was $5 when my dad told me about it. Wish I bought call options instead, would have made millions but oh well. 
10% AMD
and 5% AAPL. Trying to bring up my APPL position. Should really be my biggest. Can never have too much APPL.
Oh and 13% in BPTRX. Mutual fund with large holdings in TSLA and Spacex
How do fucking retards like you look at something thats been making massive progress over the years and say lol been happening for years never gonna happen.
That was a warmup. We keep revoting until Donald trump wins
Hahaha wtf
Thanks for this info!
Awesome thanks!
UK so no options only stocks
Only if they announce Stripe merger, otherwise it will go down for a bit
can only do stocks
lol... and you're saying i am crazy OTM buying ???
Well i made about 3k because of it so lmfao. You just seem salty because youre red af...
So you still think T D A C has good potential post merger, as it seems pretty god damn good to me. Godspeed on your plays my fellow autist
Nice!
If you have shares youll end up winning in the end, I was mostly looking for the retards that bought calls on Friday lmao. Was obviously the top
Hmm I'll check em out, I like your style.
Lol I canceled it before the dip now Im nervous it gets dripping down
Depends on the dates if I'm poor or not. Which are you eyeing? Anything past Q2 is out of my price range.
Yeah bro im fr off them Pharma oxys, feels nice.

And yeah im under 20, the bet u won is a tip to buy calls on PLTR
GL
How's that going today
I bought my $20 calls on 11/11, when GME was trading around $12 so I'm up almost 500% on those. My timing was pretty great, but I couldn't stand the fact my position was so small so I doubled down. I don't usually buy calls when iv is this high but I really want the extra leverage. I'm pretty confident in this but there is a little bit of fomo guiding me right now. If I play this right, my worst case scenario is that I lose my gains.
Yea I guess so
2pm pump as scheduled commencing now
I dont need to promote other websites here like you are. Dont need to downvote comments either.
aRRRRR 
Bag looking like dirt lol
Of course why wouldnt I. Gonna hold until at least end of December
Currently its 1.6 mil I believe, but Im trusting Cohen with GMEs future, he did it with Chewy, and Im sure he could do it with GME in this age of gaming. Also I agree with your OG post, too many penny stock pumpers, I legit dont shill GME much anymore, I used too back when it was 10-11.
Yep. You dont pay a dime on gains in a Roth which is why it should always get funded first and then you go to other stuff after. Be aware that when you sell in your brokerage you are creating a tax event, as you have been anytime you buy and sell in that so far,  (youll pay short-term cap gains taxes at your income tax rate on the gains from the sales). 

The plus side to moving to a ROTH rather than let it play out is that you dont have to MORE tax as you make more money.
400% is too good. If I were you, I would sell
Lmaoo... having or showing the weakness or diseases of old age
Yea no thats not even close to the same thing lol
Up 170% for the year. Good luck dickhead.
Thanks my dude!
Im current up almost 10% on a small position (stonk)
Of what you're microp33n? I'm good
Thats crazy bc gme is a boomer stock
Bought in early last week. Down today for that option but still up overall
Ouchies did the same but with itm calls on weds, sold em and hopped again on friday wish you the best
Ive got apex as well, surprised to see it down now too. Very bad start to the week for most of this sub. Feel it for them who are down probably thousands of dollars right now.
silly question.. If you are 100% confident on $20.. Why didn't you take that 20C step?
Wow, since march, incredible. I can tell you why I like it as a play:

-Very limited downside as long as you are smart with how you play it. If no deal gets done the SPAC money gets returned so you can only lose around 25% from here. Yes that's significant, but it's less than 100% and also if you're here you can probably stomach losing 25% on one trade.

-Upside is tremendous, big name value investors and institutions are piling in now. They likely would not be doing so unless they though a deal was almost certainly coming. This is also why it's not a pump and dump, and saying it shows you're just looking at a chart. Seth Klarman and Wells Fargo aren't getting pumped. Most of the money in this thing is institutional. And the volume and base valuation of 4 billion is way too high to reasonably be pumped, regardless of what you want to think by looking at a fucking chart.

-Reading the room and using my intuition it appears to me company acquired will be Stripe. Checkout this twitter https://twitter.com/YoloCapitalMgmt/with_replies . You can be a skeptic, but my intuition is strong and I'm going to listen to it, up to you personally on that side of things though.
Its undervalued but a rug pull as harsh as we got which led to a flight of stairs going down was something that seems to have fucked us pretty bad
Nice . 
40 in Wisconsin 

Is like 80k in New York baby 


Just be on Grindr all day and trade
tds action not making me think its amazons turn, maybe later this week but not tm
Ye bro! Just trying to decide whether to jump into ACB or APHA, the latter being the safer option but barely any movement
Nah fam u called out the bears and the bears absolutely azzraped the bulls today
Yes, I think so.
Yeah I dont know about buying in right now. Feels like a top unless they got some good news breaking soon
49% of all CTV ads go through Roku. They are unlocking e-commerce (I.e. full service ads, click on item and you can buy from Roku). Also sorry for calling you a clod and I love you
Yeah wish I had gotten into NIO. Building up an AMD position now. Also placing a large bet on S R A C too
I say it's never gonna happen in the short term because I'm not a fucking dipshit and listen when people talk (Biden and the GOP Senate). FFS grow tf up
Oh I forgot, democracy
What about AirBnB?
Bought it when BABA was 278 my guy. Fuck me...
Yea 100% it's a good space to be in. Good luck man!
Yeah - if I had calls right now, Id let you walk all over me. But exactly, will retest the top, need time now
You may yield better results from another week out on the one you buy, but up front cost will be prohibitive.
Im holding Dec 31
Lmfaoooo, enjoy the wisdom tooth baby oxies bud
If it goes over 18.50 then I'll agree

I mean, you're asking for the more expensive stock, as well as the higher odds of winning the bet
Lol you get down voted and you piss your pants. Go cry to your mom, kid. Check out other stocks kid, stonks only go up. Gosh, I am tired of these 
You are a fucking moron. Keep holding those bags bitch, you deserve it. Bunch of PLTR bitches like you are so butt hurt rn. LOL! Show me that loss porn bby!
Thanks, you as well!
it will go back up, as long as there's no panic selling we gucci
because I'm in this for the long run and the squeeze not playing weeklies

I'm in for 2800 shares

Did you consider that if the SPAC doesnt go through, many will pull out of PSTH entirely. Theres more than 25% to be lost and you're naive if you believe everyone will stick around if things will fall through.

But still did my own research and you're right that there is alot of upside. However, I'm not convinced that Stripe acquisition will occur before 2020 end. hype will die down. Still convinced that after today it's going to drop back to $24. Maybe I'll buy some long dated leaps out to June 2021
Yea weve had the serious rough end of the stick shoved so far up our asses. Im keeping these shares though, I continue to believe in all things RGB
i also had febs when they got clapped on earnings
yeah APHA... I Dunno it just has bad mojo around it. It never pumps as much but will join in on the dumps. I myself got VFF (was low IV when I got mine dated for 11c march up 100% atm)
> S R A C

What's the deal with that company?
Why are you placing a big bet on it?
Ok bitch boy lmao
We cant have his cult of worshipers sad
Airbnb is already going public next month, without a SPAC
I'm willing to accept a little more risk depending how it helps the margins. What calculator do you use?
You still think ima snitch. Im done here. Good day to you. Lmao

I'm fully long on margin including apple. Just letting you know your strategy is garbage. As is your portfolio.
Bro. You really need to take a dose of your Adderall down. I'll have my mom call yours and get it adjusted.
Theres a LOT of panic selling around here!
the spac has 4 billion in cash that gets returns if no deal gets done. it's worth 4 billion at minimum. it will not go below 20
Yeah Im probably gonna hold my shares too I just wish I had cashed out when I was so green
They're merging with Momentous a company for "last mile" delivery of satellites using water propulsion. They have a delivery going up someone in December and ticker name change should be early 2021. I feel like they'll spike for the space hype and their dealings also seem pretty solid Roth SpaceX and NASA.
optionsprofitcalculator.com . The trick is to calculate the theta drop on both options. Of course the closer to the price point it lands , the better it will payout. When you go to sell, expect to sell for maybe $50 less per spread. I entered at $50 loss.
I will tag u/J_Powell_Ate_My_Ass for you to help file a complaint.
LOL
Hold those bags bitch
Literally same but hey, we live and we learn. Ill cash out half when it hits 50
Good stuff, thanks so much!
IM NOT GOING TO FILE A COMPLAINT.
What bags? Bought more on the dip, calls are up across the board. I deal in leaps boi .
No problem. I love these for earnings, hopefully these are as good as the calculator is indicating. If you can find IV high in the weekly and low on the monthly, you can bank as long as the price target is correct.
HOLD THEM TIGHT BITCH
You
