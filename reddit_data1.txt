Every year a pair of doves makes a nest in the tree right outside my window and it makes me so happy
We appear to be experiencing a sector rotation into the "legitimate companies" sector.
Told my coworker to go all in on PLTR premarket. Feel bad man 
PLTR is never late, bears. Nor is he early. He moons precisely when he means to. 

\-Gandalf the Gambler
I was in the club last night scrolling through my all time graph on ronbinhood and this chick came up to me and said are those NKLA puts? And I replied why yes, yes they are. Arent you a fine young woman. And she asked me can we go to the bathroom so I can suck your dick? And I said no bc technically Im a gay bear bc these are puts and she said ok
Im not hearing enough about PLTR this morning, you boys ok?

WE STILL GOIN TO THE MOON 
I'm up 220% for the year but I still feel like a loser because I'm not a millionaire

Im blindly following you fucks on GME and I hope this short squeeze actually happens
PLTR NIO 
Might not be relevant but DD at the end. I once ate an entire box of those oat clusters cereals from Costco, and didn't have milk so I used almond milk. Straight up like 3,000 calories 100 grams of fiber, ate it in like 25 minutes in 1 sitting. 6 hours later my insides were being torn apart and I had the longest fart I've ever been able to muster. Imagine for a second you thought you had to shit, and you take a deep breath, and you push, and it's just a pure fart for your entire breath, after about 15 seconds you're trying not to laugh but you're in complete disbelief that you're still farting, 20 seconds, 25 seconds. Air still coming out your butt hole, you have to take a SECOND fucking breath to finish the fart off.. You didn't even have to shit..

Anyways, TSLA to the moon
PLTR let's do this
I love checking premarket knowing 9:31 will be my daily high

Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the new system would enable the authorities to identify and get on top of bottlenecks "quickly and decisively."

I'm holding a few hundred PLTR at $16.17. I'm holding for the foreseeable future. Obviously red days aren't fun but unless you have calls this is a great stock imo
30 minutes before the market opens: Hell yes!

Every. Damn. Day.
Some stock this PLTR is. As soon as I jump in on calls I lose 7k
Citron Research is holding a larger position than Soros on PLTR, starting on 11/27 after his short tweet at 9am.

Over 1% of the companys total shares, 10% of all institutional holdings.

He got his entry, did you?
I just took a shit that was slightly larger than usual. PLTR 30 EOD.
PLTR had another 500,000 shares go to the short side from the 650,000 available, leaving only 150,000 on the table - if this thing moves up, it's going to squeeze...
First. 
I am deep into pltr and crsr bought at the top ama
Instead of "selling low" I try to think of it as setting my calls free, allowing them to reach their full potential under someone else's care.
You guys think markets will be green today?
Stimulus talks going well
If Trevor sells his shares for 11$ per hes still a billionaire. Hes gonna sell and this is gonna dumpppp  
Tesla is gonna rip so hard today. Gonna be crazy. Hope yall loaded the calls up.

I can only assume the amount of people here saying PLTR is gonna completely crash means its gonna start going up again. Thats usually the case right?
The whole market is up except the meme stocks lmao
All you fuckers making stupid gains this past month, take out a couple thou of gains in cash and hold that shit in your hand. Helps you realize how much that shit is. 

Coming from a tard who didnt do this in August and played shit like it was points in a game and blew my shit up.

What does my echo chamber think?
Why do people see a 50% jump in something like BB and then assume it's the right time to get in.  The right time was before.
Its not just pltr. Everything just drilled
Stop selling your GME shares plz
Wtf GME
This is the worst green day ever
WSB promised PLTR would bring riches and bitches.

But I only see ditches and stitches.
Pump all night just so Institutions can take profit in the morning and shit on all of retail, name a more iconic duo
People who are bitching about PLTR are just impatient retards with tiny paper hands and paper cocks. Very strong support at ~ 26 I think this is the last day youll see it at this price. Buy the dip
Guys why did I buy GME only to lose money

PLTR price is where it was a week ago...
RIP 300k PLTR yoloman

SPY up 1% and half of WSB is probably wiped out
I'm so glad all the fake PLTR fanbois got wiped out. The real onlyfans keep buying shares on the dip and adding to their long dated calls
i still believe in pltr. 40 EOW
I know you guys joke about buying a call or put and the stock immediately going the other way, but robin hood literally sells your orders to investment firms so they can literally see what you're doing before you do it and then screw you over and take your money
One ticker: PLTR. Its stabilized where its gonna fall to, and is gonna fucking rocket into the eow

Just loaded up on PLTR 1/15 40c on todays sale.
Ill be honest Im getting way too greedy, WSB has corrupted me. Started off with my eyes on some nice returns over a few weeks or months, now I want 3000% gains in a week.
Sold a PLTR covered call for $180 yesterday and it's now worth $8.  Would it make sense to buy back the contract?

PLTR stock is down 7,5% today after its founder and CEO Alex Karp was revealed to not be able to propel himself forward. All videos of him walking were actually filmed downhill.

More at 11! 
Lord JPow kisses his printer good night one last time before his testimony in the morning. "We shall brrr again very soon my sweet prince", he muttered in his pajammy jams that read Unlimited QE. His plan was to restore the fed lending facilities to it's former glory at the senate testimony.

His Bears R Fuk neck tattoo started burning. As JPow clutched his jugular, he thought to himself "Fuck Yellen. All my homies hate Janet Yellen." A dart board pinned with a crumbled up picture of Mnuchin is seen in the distance.

His wife tosses and turns probably feeling discomfort from her new breasts. They are CC for covered calls. His mistress has the DDs. She softly groans and holds her teddy bear tight, a plush he never approved up but had to allow. A bull shaped night light pierced the dark Maryland winter.

A single tear drop rolls down JPow's cheek as beautiful repo operations commenced through the dead of night. Futures mooned with ease. He hadn't even purchased any treasuries today and the permarket was going to the moon.

The dip was bought.

JPow could finally sleep.
If GME opens below 17.78 I buy 100,000
PLTR TO THE MOON TODAY!
Lots of Palan**tear**s in here

 PLTR
Holy shit, I accidentally opened a call credit instead of debit spread on TSLA, instant profit because TSLA moved in the opposite way i expected which goes to show i really need to start inversing  myself. Also i need to stop trading whilst jerkin it.
Guys, let's make PLTR a thing again
My pltr debit spreads 27-30 expire Friday and all I can say is guh
Palantir is gonna kill it in February/March earnings, and shit will moon close to then. I got in at 13 and Im in shares so this is a long hold, even if it goes down to 20.

McDonalds sucks. Chic fil a is better.

PLTR shanghai'd my account kings
Should we buy tulip bulbs dip? It's down for long time now
Palantir shout out on CNBC - thanks Cramer...
Lmao, the bloomberg article about the new Nikola CEO:

"Russell has rarely missed a day of reading the Bible or other scriptures since he was 16. Once on an international flight, he realized he hadn't read any religious passages that day, so Russell walked down the aisles asking aloud if anyone had a book of scriptures he could borrow."

Now that's pretty clear that they're trying to pander to the kind of investors who would be more willing to just take it on faith that the company has more than a couple concept drawings if you ask me. What a strange article.
Strapped on my moms boyfriends motorcycle helmet, rammed through the drywall into his room stole all his money and put it all into GME. He will thank me when I pay him to leave my mom after i become a millionaire.
If you're asking yourself, should I buy APHA? Then ask yourself this. Do you like money? The answer is the same
APHA calls if you like money
NKLA FRAUD GANG CHECKING IN
I wouldn't mind bagholding PLTR because I actually think the company is decent, BUT, whichever one of you convinced me to go all in on GME - Your mums a hoe.

My 18.6 average GME shares are giving me soft hands
Started the day +3k up, 1 hour later 4k down.

and puff it's gonne

LOL
To everyone losing their minds about PLTR.

Citron said they were fairly valued at $20. Anything under $25 is a gift. Remember what happened to their previous shorts in TSLA, NIO, ENPH, GRWG, NVDA? Those stocks are all significantly higher now.

Go long with shares or wait for it to bottom out (Oversold RSI probably around $23) then buy calls.
PLTR singlehandedly ruined my year
PLTR has entered the how its going part of the meme
Sorry guys I decided to buy PLTR and GME calls on Friday so thats why it tanked

If you make 20, 30 , 40% profit on BB, for the love of god, take profit.  You cucks never learn buying at the top of PLTR, NIO, HTZ, PRPL, and every other stupid meme stock that pumps for a few days in this sub.  Shit ends up trading sideways and then down, and people lose everything.  Hogs get slaughtered.  Take profits.

RIP Meme STONKS 2020-12-01
lmao this has to be the worst meme stock day ever on WSB.
PLTR consolidated over the last two days. Ready for next take off.      
STOP THE COUNT!!!
Remember when this sub made fun of PLTR when people bought at 10 and 11 lmao
If your dad spent $130,000 at the Apple IPO and kept all the shares and passed them down to you that would be worth $121,000,000 now not including dividend reinvestment.
BUY GME OR YOU HATE AMERICA 
The bull Gods wont let us down today!
Lets ride the to early retirement!! Palantir and NIO to the fking
Back to ATH. Just like clock work. Operation pump resumed. Jpow created a monster. Hail jpow
#Trade recommendations of the month 

1. If you long TSLA stock , sell some 20-30% delta 2021 calls , as IV likely cools off after indexing and 2021 will be a bumpy growth year for TSLA ; so will be range trading opportunity
2. Long dated AMZN call, people think we going back to Macys /riteaid after vaccine comes out are probably wrong

Long term bullish on both stocks
Tsla going to be a wild ride today
Memed aapl to 2 trillion, why couldnt we do it to 3 trillion?
Why does J Pow talks every other day? Mfer should start a podcast

Wall st is attacking reddit traders.  Dont fall for it.  Hold your memes!
thc  $13 eod and $15 tomorrow, just sit tight and do some ketamine boys
To be honest I would have been more concerned if PLTR didn't correct. The stock IPO'ed 3 months ago and some of the paper-handed pussies in here think it hit ATH last week. This stock is a huge percentage of my portfolio and I'm not in the slightest bit concerned. As King Retard Warren has said, "The market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient".
BB, GME, PLTR all looking like good solid meme plays with 0 DD and 100% rock hard PP
Everyday you have people on here screeching that PLTR is too the moon and they'll each get thousands and thousands of upvotes and everyday I fucking fall for it
Just pulled out a guy who flipped his truck off the side of a hill but my stocks are all red. Used up all my retard strength
The problem is I KNOW PLTR is gonna be $50+ by mid 2021. I just dont have the kind of cash to absorb these losses if they continue. Trying to hold for greener days ahead 
Can you write off $PLTR call losses on taxes?
Remember when people actually thought they were getting a second stimmy check?
pltr ill see you in a few years i guess... at least i only have shares 
GME back on track to the moon

TSLA descending wedge on the intraday into the bottom of a rising channel on the daily candles = really good buying opportunity
I suggested my supervisor buy BB calls as a lotto play (without getting any myself) and now she's emailed everyone about her resignation. 

I have no idea how much she got.. but I guess we're getting a new supervisor now.

When PLTR hits 30 today and the FOMO hits again in here. All will be right again in the world. 9% today, then good news tonight and premarket will take this to 38$
Kinda glad PLTR dipped.  
All the paper handers sold, and now we're memeing other stocks too, and not just a whole thread of PLTR spam.
Pltr, stand back and stand by
When you find out she believes in astrology 
PLTR always looks great until the market opens and people can actually sell to get the fuck out

I hate the pltr holders that bitch all the fucking time of it saying, iTs GoInG tO mOoN tOdAy like shut the fuck up. Yes Im losing money but Im not going on a insane mental breakdown on this sub out of all places. You guys are fucking retards like find Jesus smh

Alright boys, PT by Wedbush is $49. Earnings are on 1/28 which should give a nice run up this month after profit taking these past few days. Load up on more if you like and continue to hold with those w shares/calls. Aiming to roll over my 12/18s to Jan to be more safe but hopefully it stops being a hoe and takes us to Saturn . We got this 


Edit: vol has been increasing daily, last week it was 2.3M now its around 8M rn.

My PLTR calls are looking fucked
I can see PLTR falling a little each day, perhaps a couple green days until the 12th, then soaring once the vaccine is distributed.

Im not so fussed about selling it all now to try and get in at a lower price; my average is $17 and happy to watch the concrete gains drip for now. PLTR is the real deal, paper hands dont @ me

VERY COOL
PLTR Cyber Monday Sale extended through today! Get yours while supplies last
Here I am watching my money burn 
APHA IS GONNA MOON
Im straight up not having a good time.
NIO doesnt do any harm. Doesnt hurt anyone. Why is this happening. How is everyone just letting this happen
#**my longest guh ever**
GME dudes who are having a nervous breakdown, from a GME bagholder since early June:

This is a classic paper hand shakeout. MMs wants to buy and accumulate the calls they sold at $20 for cheap.
THC making me real fucking sad right now.
PLTR double bottom. Buy up this dip boys
I honestly feel bad for the people who bought RadioShack...I mean GameStop
#HALT NIO FFS 
I own a lot of expensive pltrs. Not the call kind the other kind that last longer. Should I just come back next week?
Lol my watchlist is so red, but Nasdaq is so green
Bulls last night: "bears should've sold their puts they are so fucking STUPID and GREEDY you fucking deserve this"



Also bulls: entire portfolio PLTR and NIO calls
My asshole hurts

Pltr moon mission through the center of the Earth
Literally went from every single post of this subreddit being PLTR to almost complete silence when the dumping gets bad. I smell something fishy
PLTR got me wanting to die lol luckily theres bigger loss porn in here to make me feel better about being a retard
Diamond hands motherfuckers diamonds hands
How much did you invest in PLTR? 

I've got $11k and am bleeding heavily.
I woke up this morning feeling great.... My portfolio was up 10K at 7:30AM. By 9:30 it was up $3,500. By 10:42 it was down $3,500!! Yay!!!!
STOP THE COUNT!
A PULLBACK IS HEALTHY
Well today is quite the boring day. Time to actually do some work at my job
this casino sucks guys
TSLA needs to get above $600. Important key level
Thank goodness for this purge. Every so often WSB gets filled with newbies who clutter up actual insights. Such as $PSTH and $TSM babyyyyyyy
PLTR and GME gang in shambles

Lots of bagholders fell for the pump and dump
Do you guys see PLTR crashing completely or sit tight? Holding a good amount of shares at $27.11 avg price.
I will drown with this ship. 

PLTR 12/31 35C
Hedgies trying to push down GME, eh? Fuck it, I'll grab some more. 
I was told TSLA would moon
when you have 35K in your account you can trade as much as you want. lose 10k within a day and you are fallgged as a pdt without the chance of opening new trades... absolutely no fkn sense in ameripoors laws.
I sold my BB shares to buy PLTR shares last Thursday. I hate myself
Lol I love that this sub was talking about taking over GameStop yesterday and now everyone wants to throw themselves out of a window today
I feel like PLTR in pressure cooker mode.  Once it finds a bottom whales will start jumping in.
PLTR is a legit company and this is a good price!
PUMP APHA
Oh Boys Blackberry is going crazy. bought it yesterday when it was down 5%
Note to self: never trust retards pumping stocks on here. Sold AAPL HON & TSM last week to buy meme stocks and now my account is just bleeding while those 3 stocks are reaching new highs
Well shit... I used to own a blackberry 10 years ago
New bipartisan stimulus bill $908,000,000,000

GME going strong, fingers crossed 
Does anyone else just sit in their shower for like 30 minutes because its relaxing and takes the pain away?
Every fucking meme stock PLTR, GME, NIO is drilling my ass to my ass core!!!
Finance classes will one day teach about the destruction caused by the GME short squeeze. Be a part of history. Buy GME shares. 
I dropped pltr for apha and FUCK
Haha I traded with emotion and now bagholding TSLA 570c 12/4 with no day trades
***US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says he spoke with McConnell, McCarthy, Meadows, and Trump this morning and all agreed there should be targeted fiscal response***
APHA fucked my gains from november straight to hell
just bought NIO after making fun of everyone this morning. am asshole
Buy Blackberry we can meme this
Reading this thread is always so enlightening.  So y'all rode up a stock like 40% didn't take any profits and are 50% down on your folio because the stock retraced to where it was 4 trading days ago... Like how is it even possible to be that smoothbrained?
AAPL mooning
PLTR retained former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director George Tenet as advisers

Hellos fellow PLTR bagholders!
Market rallies on hopes of future rally
if theres anything ive learned this past first week of doing stocks, is to not buy anything this place recommends if its already gone up by more than 10% in the past week, let alone 100% in the past month.
Gonna blow all my gains on a purchase to reward myself. Im thinking a bag of skittles.
GME covered calls yesterday was a great idea
So happy I only trust you fucks enough to make PLTR my smallest position 
MNUCHIN SAYS HE SUPPORTS LEGISLATION TO HELP PPP FORGIVENESS

I've been holding blackberry leaps for months. Today is my day boys.
When I die I'll be known as the guy who lost all of his money during the greatest stock market environment in US history. Down $125k and counting. Lost $20k in SNOW calls between yesterday and today.

Only gaps that PLTR is going to fill are the b-holes of gay bears
this sub had been infiltrated. things are becoming very similar to stocktwits. not cool
I managed to make money on my TSLA 12/4 650c today 
All memes eventually die

Horoscopes often lie

Nothing is for sure nothing is for certain nothing lasts forever

But until they close the curtain

It's him and I 

Aquemini
You know youre a retard when you actually bought at a higher price than the peak on the options price chart
When people try to convince you that a meme stocks pull back is good. Just realize they don't know what meme power means and if that shit dies its dead.
I hate cash. Hate it. Every buck I own needs to be put to work.

APHA preparing for lift-off
Good morning APHA males
PLTR was doing this exact shit yesterday morning - teasing my balls premarket (28ish), then deepthroated the shaft few mins into open (30), then used a bunch of teeth and bit down (meme stonk recession - 24).
Takin a big crap, eatin pizza off a plate Ive got sittin on the floor, browsin wsbs. This is how champions start their day

Who am I kidding - its going to have a giant red candle 5 mins into the open as always.
Its Tuesday boys you know what that means!

Stimulustalksgoingwell.exe
If I wasnt a crackhead today would be a day to just hold my positions and chill and not watch.

But I will be checking them obsessively like every other day.
Can we all post one at a time? So much good advice
"Stocks surge on economic recovery hope" but the indexes are positive for the year? What recovery still needs to happen? What does the current price reflect? Who is the retard that makes these headlines and assigns movements to news?
LOL...  Goldman Sachs analyst Fei Fangraised the bank's price target on Li Auto to $60 from $20.60, maintaining a "Confident Buy" rating.
The bank also raised its rating on NIO to Neutral from Sell and raised its price target significantly to $59 from $7.70.

Idiots about time.
 MERGER!!!!
Pump till lunch then dump  dead cat bounce from yesterday. My left testicle is twitching so I know it's going to rain
I want to pump BABA but goddamn I hate this stock so fucking much
The good thing to be an Europoor is that even PLTR droping in US premarket my balance in Euro still doesn't move due to the fact that the Dollar is a meme compared to the Euro.
This NKLA shit is aids. Die already. Stupid Trevor tryna pump this shit up so he can dump.
 
"so what's bullish on the NKLA/GM news?"

Currently holding PFE and looking at MRNA is equivalent to betting on the wrong horse. 

Just ban me from the tracks already.
A while ago when NET dropped into the thirties this kid in some discord said he was thinking about buying $100c leaps ...they were prly cheap af. I wonder if this is how I should start playing things.
What is the meme stock for today boys?
I'm legit buying SPY puts if this premarket holds up, this is just retarded.

Still holding GME though fuck those shorts.
S-N-D-L.... enough said

PLTR looking strong resisting. Green by 11 am
So we holding through until 8th GME boys?
Palantir is supposedly the next TSLA, PYPL, or SQ. In the early days there will be rapid swings. Stop obsessing over it day in and day out. Buy and hold

CRSR holy shit
CRSR holders rewarded BIGLY
Yall told me GME would take me to the promised land 
CRSR the only meme stonk thriving - the rest are ded along with my hopes and retiring on a yacht with 5 of the finest slutina hookers

TSLA destroying both calls and puts.
Listen retards, hold the line on GME. The tendies will come, but remember, if you paperhand your portion you are fucking over your fellow retards.

Rotation out of meme stocks apparently
PLTR you were supposed to defeat the short sellers not join them!
PLTR is gonna rocket on good news, have faith my fellow autists

All of the news for NIO was good and this happens
Remember the hope we had premarket?

Who has the tiny penis now? 
Screw this, Im going back to bed
im just here for the PLTR comments.
Lol, BlackBerry is up like 30% and no one gives a shit about them.
Nothing worse than waking up to all your tickers deep red while QQQ casually up almost 1%
Upvote if you are over leveraged and under educated
TSLA GANG WILL RISE AGAIN
Everyone who fomo'd into spacs getting utterly destroyed right now haha.
Lol bunch of paper hands. I swear this sub only likes to buy shit up 10-50% on the day. 
THC bee guh
Reminder that PLTR was at ~10 a month ago lmao, people need to relax
Welp my PLTR leaps are bleeding. Not worried, diamon handing this for the next couple of months at the very least.
If PLTR and NIO can just keep hitting ATH thatd be great
There was no time to get out of TSLA calls this morning. Fucking brutal.
PLTR call holders just got Nate Robinsoned 

Ran in face first into losses not knowing what the fuck they were doing! 
I dont know what to buy. Shits either already ripped or a deep red meme stock.

Does this mean...I have to do my own DD???
NIO is the biggest buy of a lifetime right now.
No matter how you slice it, Alibaba $BABA should have a market cap of $2T. As long as they arent cooking the books.
Oh no, Im only up 21% and 82% on my NIO and PLTR shares. What a shame
*WSB discovers spacs*

they proceed to drill for the rest of eternity
I keep getting fucked in the ass by all these meme stonks but I never learn
TSLA really loving that 584-589 range

BlackBerry is the next meme stock
Wow, NIO! Stop butt raping me! I am a virgin, okay!

Blackberry vaccine 99% effective, also heard saying "stimulus talks going well" to reporters earlier today after talking with mr. Pow
My mind is telling me no...

BUT MY BODY. MY BODYYYY IS TELLING ME TO HOLDDDDD 
Alright, I hope this reminds everyone that AMZN exists and its a great stock.
EVERYONE IN PLTR:  Remember to roll over your  call options to a later date.  Having them expire this Friday is a bad strategy since they will decay very fast.
Hyln has been nothing but a fucking money pit to my account also thats the biggest head and shoulders youll ever see
damn I remember owning a blackberry back then when we didnt have smartphones thought I was the shit
Close your app and walk away lol

BlackBerry just needs to announce an EV and watch it go up x100
Yall made pltr die? I thought you guys were bringing it to 40
If you want to buy a stock that has a chance for PLTR gains without the volatility, Pfizer is about to moon by end of year. Big news coming out every week through the end of the month
[Me watching my Palantir position](https://i.redd.it/nn5lvs46ol261.jpg)
Waiting for the PR about vaccine distribution tracking by PLTR
Burnt all the pltr gains of last week and now back to being negative all time. No problem
Anyone know what the ticker for clown equipment is? Because my fucken dumbass sold my baba calls for apha leaps.
I swear we are living in fucking purgatory.

Every fucking time JPow talks, it's "hey congress you should probably do something." It's been the same message for like 8 months now, yet nothing has changed. And they keep inviting him back to say the same thing. 


The fuck are we doing
Any hope for thicc boi left?

Pray for NIO. Its going through some shit rn
I rode PLTR all the way up, then all the way back down to nearly breakeven. One of these days I'll be like hmmm +1000% I should just sell now. Now I'm in some PFE calls vaccine gang 
Meme stonks on hard mode this week 
Remember when pre-markets were red Sunday and all the bears said rug pull was coming 
Thic going up to $20 in a week. GME going up when rev beats on 7th. Buy.
I heard $GME was supposed to go to $100 or something. My calls sure hope so.
Meme stonks , boomer stonks .  This happened 2 weeks ago as well, member what happened like 3 days later?

All you paper handed cucks getting shaken out at the first sign of a dip.  HOLD THE LINE!!!!
Saw BB this morning. First time I decided nope not doing it, no FOMO today... they always dump right after open. 
Lmao who the fuck wouldve thought BB would be keeping my portfolio alive 
Can PLTR stop shitting the bed
I mean, GME short sellers are either gonna wait for eternity paying interest, or eventually buy back their shorts... *right?!*
Fuck IV crush. PLTR 23 12/18P is shitting the bed

Literally 80% green today except for NET, FSLY, GME, PLTR, NIO, FCEL, SNOW, etc (and other tickers can't post because apparently banned)
Bought NIO, PTR, JMIA, and GME at the peak on Monday lol fuck me
looks like PLTR gonna be flat at $25 for the rest of the day
PLTR, you were the chosen one!  It was said that you would destroy the bears, not join them. You were supposed to bring balance to WSB, not leave it in darkness!
Gold and Silver tendies incoming!
It is funny that were pissed TSLA only went up 3% lol
Buy the Blackberry dip
TSLA looking like a good near term pop. I've seen this consolidation way too much only for it to run-up much higher
Thic B on life support. RIP guys its over
Market bigly green. Why my hand-picked stonks red?
Today feels weird
Die NKLA die die die
SPY touched ATH today, but by judging the sub youd think it was a actual red day.
NIO and PLTR have the same charts :0
Back to the old AMZN and AAPL calls. Buy 2 months out cant lose money. Or YOLO.
Papa Musk's email:

"When looking at our actual profitability, it is very low at around 1% for the past year. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude thats not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffl under a sledgehammer!"
BB new meme stock, hop on 
Ugh - I put everything into TSLA calls last night and Im not feeling so hot about them right now.
The Bid-Ask Spreads on RH is Aids
You can buy Blackberry now before it hits 10
Only tickers that matter today:
TSLA
AAPL
NVAX
MRNA
Hey paper hands, don't come to GME if you're selling at any hint of a profit.
Hey Im back we still at war with the head?
Lol this chat volume dried up QUICK with PLTR killing those call options bought at the top.
markets magically gapped up and recovered all of yesterdays losses

where exactly were all these buyers yesterday? they only show up when volume is pitiful?

lmao this market is a straight up casino, except whenever you lose, JPow visits your hotel room at night and stuffs all your lost chips under your pillow
so is PLTR safe now 
PLTR BUY THE DIP
PALANTARDS IN SHAMBLES  
I AM PALANTARD
I hope Andrew Left loses everything at some point in his pathetic life.
wsb on every 5m red PLTR candle: bought the pltr dip here averaged down on pltr generational pltr buying opportunity here doubled down on pltr here on this dip
Imagine going balls deep on PLTR at $33 ..

Who are the cucks pushing down PLTR Pre market?
GME has given us some of the best gain porn Ive ever seen on here. Its also a ticking time bomb for the greatest loss porn weve ever seen
PLTR about to finish off half this sub today by the looks of it.  Always inverse WSB
I just went out for a jog on the trail behind my house with my dog (around 530am) and some homeless guy was asleep on the trail in a sleeping bag. I live in a relatively nice suburb and I dont ever see homeless where I live. So sad. Scared me half to death at first though, I thought it was a dead body until the guy fuckin moved. I ran the other direction but then after a bit of walking I started feeling really awful that someone would have little to no options that they have to sleep on a gravel paved trail in a sleeping bag.
PLTR is the future, fuk the haters
I'm not selling PLTR hahahahaha
 bois buying more or what?
Guys are we seriously going to let Shitron win??? Lets see those DIAMOND HANDS retards
Robinhood traffic is high and PLTR is dumping. You guys are paper handed pussies
Fuck every GME shill on this sub
Very sad day to be with T H C B
RIP meme investors
what's happening with PLTR is called a shakeout

don't paper hands your shares

your weekly calls might be fucked but if you sell your shares you will regret it big time
Profited over $2,000 today off BB options after joining WSB 2 days ago and seeing a comment to buy a BB call at $6 
Buy the dip boys. GME & PLTR till I die

I'm not expecting PLTR to hit $40 TODAY by 31-33 would be pretty nice
Daily reminder that i hate RKT
Looks like those aapl FDs I bought yesterday are going to pay out

Rip RIOT gang, dead in premarket
Spread em Andrew Left 
Daily reminder that $U only goes up
Good morning traders. Would pick up GME premakret. It has meme status now.
> Its IPO prospectus showed the company has seen annual net losses every year since its launch, and it warned that it may not be able to ever turn a profit. For the nine months ending on September 30th, Airbnb saw a net loss of $696.9 million on revenue of $2.52 billion, compared to a loss of $322.8 billion for the same period last year.

Firstly Im sure 322 Billion is a typo

Secondly, its so weird to me that a company can release a statement along the lines of we may never be profitable ever and people still be excited about it
I hate when you see futures mooning and then you look at your specific positions and they're not up as much as you thought.
I hope TESLA  today
Really want to get into NIO but the HFCA act is way to damn close for comfort

Buying GME dip second it breaks 16
Interesting how quiet it is in here
Noob questions, can you set a sell limit? Example, if pltr continues to shit the bed can I set a price limit to automatically sell?

Edit: thanks everyone yall are the cats pajamas

Y'all got any more of those v-shaped recoveries?
What in the ever loving fuck is GME doing.
Doubling down by depositing more money and buying more PLTR as it sinks to $25. Praying for the boom back to 30
Who could have predicted that all meme stocks shilled on WSB are down 10%?
sigh, at this point I can't even afford $ROPE
GME and PLTR going down while the market is up isn't a good sign

Predictions on APX T?
Free : 1. Turn off your phone
        2. Go back to sleep.

 gang rise up!
This reminds me of a couple months ago - market green AF, my portfolio BLOOD RED. 

Spain no S. 
JPow is going to use the words raise and rates in the same sentence and we are going to dump
Down 75% of my entire portfolio holding until Im down 100%
PLTR like clockwork
Very nice start on a cup and handle forming on PLTR. Looking good boys!
Lots of people getting their true WSB welcoming. If you can get past this, itll be ok and you can start working on recouping those losses.
PLTR just did 4 consecutive green dildos. He lives!
Boomers absolutely killing it today!
Lmfao Tesla fucking scary af
This will be the day we tell our grand kids about - when we bought PLTR under $25
It's a "don't look at my portfolio" type of day today
If nio ends green, Ill blow your wifes boyfriend
NIO here we go! 
I doubled down on PLTR already should I triple down
Realized Im getting pretty much full on addicted to this shit. Like a true degenerate addict im gonna yolo my last $8000 on otm puts. If they print then its the universes way of telling me Im meant to be a gambling addict.
Hard to reverse when a stonk starts at -10% on the day
Fuck this man
Aw geez. Not this stimulus crap again.

Got the last of my buys in GME below $16 - lets see if it pays off
Guess who bought calls at the top 
NKLA bears are the only bears that I can tolerate
anyone wanna start a minecraft world
Loss porn gonna be rich tonight
Welp, no longer checking the market every 30 minutes.

Gonna just let my stocks sit cause clearly this is gonna be a shit week.
Why are rich people always telling poor people to donate money
Imagine for a moment the market pulls back. I will literally never recover from that drop. My portfolio blood red as is, and thats with a green market.

I know many of you autists are right there with me 
Christ. What happened? How did I end up here?
And we melt up the rest of the day that was ez
Me in the green still by 0.003% 

IM FIGHTIN FOR MY FUCKIN LIFE 
Oil plays are such easy money
Well at least my PLTR share gang I can wait this out, but my 12/4 $29c seems like a lost lottery ticket at this point.
Doubled down on the gme dip 
not having a position is boring af damn
If any of you are selling off shares in dips you are actually dumb.

Hold on until it goes back up and then sell. Don't let emotions control you.
Careful to not bag hold APHA. Weed stocks are always sell the news
Looks like I'm losing 9K on PLTR this week :(

Gained 2K on PFE this am

Need to regain the other 7K loss - any ideas?

As much as my balls are stretched rn cuz of NIO, this is such a good entry tho... Im buying more shares

I didnt think it was possible to make a losing play every fucking time.

Whats with all the  boomers selling off on EV stocks?
GME almost green!
Fuck me I just threw money at BB


I genuinely have a gambling problem
Not a gey ber but this would be a spot to buy poots on spy based on my crayons.

Don't want bears to starve. get some tendies so you have strength to say rUg PUlL TmRw! 

Then we can all laugh at you as you don't take your gains and we kick the rotten salmon from your mouth and make a side business setting up a booth to have people pay 5 dollars to ride atop your back and get a picture this christmas.
OF COURSE BB DIPS THE SECOND I BUY FUCK
Hopefully this TSLA bull flag isnt a fake out
BB is going to be insane in the next few weeks. Save this
GME 
Can TSLA break through 600 again?
Pltr buy the dip boiiiss
Prediction, TSLA $600 by 1:46pm
Days like this make you say to yourself ok next time Im up BIG Im definitely cashing out and diversifying

And when youre up again you double down on shit thats up 20%. 


almost every ticker I've added to my WSB list because some 'tard mentioned it is red today.

$RTRD is strong.
Shorts just lost the battle for GME today, for now...
Holding 1,000 shares of GME until Im a millionaire
Just bought a share of GME to help squeeze. I did my part, have you?
Tesla really needs to break out over $600 or calls will just bleed and bleed
PLTR & GME calls have me about to load up on $ROPE
If I had avoided the latest WSB memes Id be up 10% today. Instead up <1% I love you guys!
Cathy woods need to buy more PLTR
Cmon AMZN these are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those up

What we have here is a rotation into Apple 
Bought PSTH, TSLA and a couple small caps this morning. They've been dropping ever since.

I am the COVID of the stock market.
This is Tim Apple's world. We're just living in it.
market just keeps going up but somehow all my positions are down, can't wait to get fucked even harder once there's a pullback
enjoy my 10 dollars in theta u r getting today thetagang lol
You guys are all gay
AMD bout to do it to em
"How's the market today?" Is a question without meaning if you're not in megacap tech, or funds. "The Market" is up over 1% today and my entire portfolio is blood red.
I would have been a billionaire if it weren't for that dastardly CITRON blog and his market MEDDLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CRSR????????? YEEEEEEEE
Blackberry hitting 10 today lol
Honesty dont know what to buy
GME EOD predictions? I'm thinking $20.
I hope the SEC under Biden investigates the fuck out of Citron for manipulating the market. Mother fuckers intentionally created a run on PLTR while issuing puts, making that shit crash.
Bullish on AMZN,  AAPL, and BNTX near term.    
Nio and ZM have been heavily beaten down, looks it's time to buy more and take profits within a quarter.   
PLTR... still holding. Believe in mid- to long-term upside.
These new guys are killing me

5 posts about theta decay and TSLA but they dont know why its happening
BB wants a 70% run?
If you didnt buy Blackberry this morning you aint black, Barry
I took a gamble and went with all WSB stock picks and literally lost on everyone one of them since last week lol. Pulled all my $$ and went back to my own strategy of grinding out Ws on a wider spread of stocks I pick myself after DD. PLTR and GME lol this sub has lost people sooo much money since last week.
I fomod into BB. Throwback to my first ever smartphone
BB WON'T STOP 
Thank you Blackberry
AMZN 3300 by Friday. MAKE IT HAPPEN JEFF
EARS just dropped hard literally after that first guy posted to buy in

i was promised apha would bring the tendies
Blackberry has literally saved my portofolio


Slowing bleeding out past 2 hours
Remember PLTR was at this price exactly a week ago just before Thanksgiving.
A WSB cleansing is upon us
Anyone else lose like 15% of their portfolio's worth since November 27? Feeling like a proper retard now after only seeing gains for my first couple months of trading.
Loading up on  longs

15000 @ 13.10 at the moment

Another 15000 at 11.90 and I'm averaging 12.50!!

Boom
My portfolio was APHA and PLTR.
Should i quit
Mid-day red, bleeding dry

all my stocks, i want to cry

inverse sentiment, buy buy buy

buy the lows, tomorrows high

trust in memes, to the sky

I'm losing track of all these fucking Spacs. Looks like there's like 3 every other day. Which one is still around $10 that i can dump $20k on?
Its crazy how you dont need to time the market at all anymore. What we really need to time, are these retards either paper hand selling their calls or pumping a stock. Its kind of a good indicator; you see WSB retards panic selling, indicates buy more and then vice versa.
^(TSLA) Bears R Fuk
Am I the only idiot that bought ROOT at ipo and continues to hold them
RKT... Can it really be? Here to save my March calls?
Not even thinking about, thinking about, taking profits.
NET hitting $80 today I feel it .
Considering how divorced the market is from reality considering NKLA calls.
P\* stocks were good in NOV (PLTR, PSTH)

which letter for Dec my fellow retards
crsr pre market looking good
Once upon a time there was  a thing called stimulus , in hopes the market rallied, then it didnt come , and the market acted like it never rallied because of it. Then talks came back to the table and the market rallied like it never heard of such a good thing before.
Just bought gme stock on margin and already got margin called literally a day later, is this normal?

Edit down 2%
anyone in airlinees or cruises is JACKED TO THE TITS right now
CCL, JETS, GME, PLTR all calls. Lets fucking go
OTM arkk calls is free money
APHA 10+ very soon
Real talk, the way people are talking about NKLA on their sub is the same shit people were saying when they were buying ACB as it plummeted to worthlessness over at weed stocks. Its just a few more thousand at this deep discount, average down.
What do you think PSTH will be and when will it be announced? Spacs definitely are a gamble lool
JPOW every other time: Tools. Power. Powertools.

&#x200B;

JPOW this time: Tools are not enough- we need comprehensive leadership, a vaccicne, containment strategy on the virus, and immediate financial intervention for average americans. Something about the Fed's expanded mandate for equitable wages and economic growth in minority populations being cool with him. Then a final reminder that everything is fuck without congressional intervention and big big tools and facilities with unrelenting ammunition sources.

&#x200B;

Then drill
Go back to bed bears
all I ask from today is CRSR not end red. Last three days have been rough.
I'm a giant pussy so I sold all of my nio. Came away with 10K profit so can't complain right now but I will probably regret this
tech bulls rise up
Name a better duo:

RKT and being rangebound between 20-22

At least selling put spreads or calls spreads is free money
FUBO is one of those stocks that you see go up everyday and you know you should be in until one day it's $60 and you think about all those times you could've dipped your feet in...
You know how your parents had a change jar, well I have my own change jar of a kind. If I have a big winner I'll skim a little off the top and put it in another account I have labeled *Retard FDs*. I'm going to use it to buy whatever meme stock is the flavor of the week.

Right now I got about tree fiddy in it.
ROKU just steadily climbing to $300 on the sidelines
seem to anyone else like PSTH is going to announce a merger soon?

Thinking of dumping my TSLA 630C 12/4 at open, im guessing it pings towards 600 but drops again. This TA is pulled right from my rear
No issues with this market going up. Just asking, modestly, if we could maybe touch SPY200 today so I can exit my VXX calls.
Whats Tesla going to today realistically?
Trevor milton is not really a bad guy. He is pos
I know yall are about that PLTR and GME life but holy shit MRNA...
Some people say the Fed isn't printing money, but I can find no other explanation for this retarded rally strength. Don't give me that bond yields BS either.
The best thing about reaching ATH, we can keep hitting ATH everyday for the next 4 years
Am I really buying blackberry?

Everyone into BB calls. Lets do our part pushing it higher
Gyna pump, lol

***A private study found that China factory activity rose to 10 year high and China will account for one third of global production in 2021***

***Financial experts confident that economy will surpass pre-COVID19 levels in 2021, but warned that governments should not pull support until 2022***
Why does the all-at-once TSLA inclusion in the S&P feel like a trap?

Edit: Two hours into the trading day and it is a trap.
Oh SHIT its almost brickmas! Merry Christmas gucci mane 
Anybody buying $BB? Multi year agreement with Amazon for their driving software
If someone had BB options for a buck each they about to be wealthy today

At this point AAPL and MRNA calls are free money
Whats BlackBerry ending at today
Cant believe I sold my spy 12/2 368 yesterday like a fucking 
If we dont sell off at open its just a trip to mars for the rest of the day

IMNOTFUCKENLEAVEN
Gold & Silver beginning to rally hard. In combination with the equity market strength that can only mean one thing:   


stimulus.   


Powell & Mnunchins congressional powwow today will likely spend a lot of time talking about further stimulus.
GME today is the day daddy pls
PXT tendies when 
Remember guys the following rule

1. If you see red then buy calls - keep buying calls until it starts to turn green (this usually takes between 5 minutes to 1 day maximum)
2. If you see green then buy calls - it will stay green and keep going up
3. Profit $$

This is how to win in this market - nothing has ever stayed red in 7 months
Buy BB dip? If that happens. Or too late? Will it keep mooning is 10-12 plausible? Will AMZN break 3250? I have many questions and I want everything to rocket, only green dildos plis

TSLA 620 EOD
To quote the movie 300:

Boys, Give them Nothing, But take from them, EVERYTHING.

Lets fucking start December off right. Merry Xmas bitches
Some people are about to be extremely rich from Blackberry calls
Tim is giving you retards one last chance to buy calls before we take off to $130.

I would love a random BABA moon shot to $270
Its always funny when the one stock you invested most of your account in is in the red (PLUG) yet literally every other single stock is bigly green
Kicking myself for choosing BionTech last month over Moderna. Shouldve known that Moderna is more of a household name and would do better in the market. Couldve been up 200% as opposed to 25%. Oh well.
Love reading the spammers on stocktwits shouting from the rooftops: Tesla 1000! when it could easily go to twelve-hundred
Dont be surprised if GME drops immediately at open. Happens almost everyday but then shoots back up. Hold onto your shit if it does and you will be rewarded!
Let the market dicking begin 
someday robinhood wont glitch the fuck out and I wont need to wonder if I'm looking at a real number or not
Just to make sure were all on the same page. All in on BB in 4 mins yes?
Nothing worse than taking a pre market shit and plugging the toilet lol

Where are all the idiots pushing APHA this morning?
Sooo... Some money comes in AH and premarket, market opens, some sell their positions, market drops, market returns. It's like groundhog day.
No resistance at all for TSLA until 600, just need buy side volume 

#I WILL HOLD

I know I will be downvoted to hell, but everyone getting greedy again. When everyone gets greedy, it's time to sell. This is clearly not sustainable..
Seriously, what the hell is going on with PLTR?
Im in danger
That feeling when you pulled out of a stock at the top.
Are people selling off PLTR because theyre scared that the news article from the UK called them a controversial company? Pussies
RIP PLTR & NKLA

TSLA gang ...we're gonna go back up.

People say inverse WSB, but tbh, you should inverse Goldman Sachs.
Apple gonna hit 130 EOW no doubt, trust the vibes
SPY is forming a megaphone on the 5-yr and considering half the country has nothing in their pockets but lint right now it seems pretty clear which way this is going. Gonna be a lot of chickens running around with their heads cut off when it finally happens. I trade both ways for the record; just making an observation.
if GME goes to 12 I'm liquidating my organs and going all in.
Lets get through 42 CRSR gang
ZM crushes expectations but drops 12%?
So far the day is going terrible. Cant believe I set an alarm to wake up at opening bell for this.
What the fuck is BABAs issue
Looks like Im going to need some stimulus talks going well headlines.
Not feeling so good about those SPY puts I was confident about like 15 minutes ago 
Felt sick just looking at my portfolio then
Cheap GME at the bottom. Run it up bois
If anyone here is questioning how bad their decision making is after a couple rough plays, just remember that someone out there is currently putting in a buy order for NKLA right now
Just bought 100 more GME shares, let's go!!!
Yes hi Wendys? Can I get one V shaped recovery please, with a side of calls and... oh youre out. Okay well can I grab an application while Im here. Than... thank you. Ill come in I need to park my bicycle one sec

I dont understand! Who is still buying Nikola? Like who thinks thats STILL a good idea?
PLTR shares cost basis is $10.20 and I sold 30, 31 and 33 calls last week against my shares for stupid high premium. Free tendies
Market is not straight today.
Thinkin bout that PLTR dip.   
why is it that as soon as i buy TSLA it just drops like rock?
Michael Burry if you there move GME up to 18 please
Lol shorts trying to navigate GME down but it's not going to happen. When they run out of muster, that shit is going to skyrocket

Great for swing trading if you can catch the right direction though

Apparently when I buy a call the stonks only go down. So Ill let you know next time so you can buy puts.
meme massacre
GME was predicted to drop to around 15.80 before the surge. All you paper handlers will continue to be poors if you sell at the first sight of red
Lol if you have TSLA dated for 12/11 or further just go drink a protein shake.
My PLTR 12/18s are shaking in their boots right now
Im not having fun anymore JPow
I'm long on pltr so ain't too stressed but It's mad to me how much one persons opinion can make everything do a 180...
Hows the fam doing today? **Always** check in with yourself. Go for a run or get some exercise doing *something* outdoors. Lets get those gains in the markets and in life.

PLTR bulls got to taste Citron's Citrusy Citrus.

I will literally boycott citron for the rest of my life
Diamond hands bois. Don't fall for bear trap.

-Shocked Pikachu face-
Retards here dont realize these types of days are prime buying opportunities.
Bought in some cheap PLTR leaps. See you guys in the fucking moon
Goodbye pltr 
GME Gang I think we just survived the dip
Helms Deep looked like it was going to fall after 2 days of intense fighting. But those retards held, just like GME gang will continue to hold until Gandalf shows up and squeezes the life out of those shit banks and we make tendies on our way to a utopian society where GameStop runs the world.
Holding this PLTR position. Shorts have to cover eventually but I have all the time in the world.
people saying fake dump dont understand there are people who actually sell stocks sometimes.

&#x200B;

It has to go down, even temporarily. Referring to every red candle as a dump is the ultimate paper handed outlook

&#x200B;

edit: a "dump" is like a 1% drop in 15 minutes. A "fake dump" is a 1% drop at the open or after some announcement and then a reversal. A red 15 minute candle is just buying and selling.
lil uzi - all my stocks are dead push me to the edge (ft. Wallstreet tiktokers who bought pltr at peak)
When is the weed vote?
Buy the NIO dip
this fucking sucks, I dont even want to trade anymore
On one hand, watching my thicc boy, GME, and apex drop like a rock makes me want to sell. On the other hand, this is how Ive perfected my strategy of buy high and sell low....

So Im going back to sleep. Damn night shift!
The europoors are selling

Smart money is rebalancing into boomer stonks. See F, GM, WFC, JPM, etc. 

DONT FUCKING FOLLOW THEM, HOLD THE LINE
Who else still believes in CRSR ?
PLTR and NIO holders both making the same noise: "NIIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
Greed is one hell of a drug
Never trust the market if it doesn't move in a straight upwards line
Took my losses on PLTR and made my moneys back on APPL and PFE scalps. Back up from the negative this week; time for a congratulatory dick beat
Really sure that this isnt a recovery for pltr just a bounce before it drills so hard it finds oil
this guy is right. small business is a family. washington does not give a fuck.
I guess MM's had enough of WSB....SPY skyrocketing while our meme stocks are getting crushed :(

Don't buy puts. Buy the dip. We'll pump for no reason and you'll lose all of your money.
Im out to destroy the PLTR bots for fucking me over
Nothing makes you feel dead more than a red day
Look at this TSLA fuck ass order book 

How is this bitch moving up? 
Idk Im doubling down tho
Whoever wrote that DD on DISCA a couple of weeks back, thank you.
Thankfully I dont have a job at the moment, but I dont understand how you retards can play these meme stocks without staring at your phone all day. Ive been standing by my coffeemaker for the past 10 minutes glued to my phone.
The rate that i can make and lose money is impressive.
Pltr and gme cyber Tuesday sales today

Can't believe I have to say this but "diamonds hands" doesn't apply to FD's
TSLA better not fucking dump EOD again because we don't have more S&P "news" AH to save us
And thus starts the V shape recovery. Always gotta hold through that morning dump!
Wow blackberry
Anyone with like 1/2 billion sitting around, just throw it all in amazon.  Long term you will be fine. Short term it will give my call a nice bump and let me cash out.

Warning: odd dark pool share prints for SPY and SPHB

Seeing SPHB suddenly print in the midst of SPY shares (SPHB is the S&P 500 ETF for extreme market bulls, the SP high beta index) sets off my tutes's dumping potential warning.

SPY $336,000,000 in shares

SPY $336,000,000 in shares

SPY $222,000,000 in shares

SPHB $337,000,000 in shares all printed at once

The squeeze will be real for Palantir Bears this week. Poor bears.
Dear Tsla bears again,

I am sorry for your retardness. It is not entirely your fault. Your retardness is a result of bad education, lack of mentorship, and low self-esteem. I have been saying that Tesla will continue its mooning, as a desperate attempt to save you dumb mrons. You can blame me, as my effort was clearly not enough. I am truly sorry. 

Sincerely, Tesla call YOLOer
BEE GANG 
Stay strong PLTR gangs
GME no why =(

GME you quit this shit right now, Ive had it up to here
Ok it is official. PLTR is dead. killed by Shitron. RIP
Patience and discipline are nonexistent on WSB.
So I feel like a retard for actually buying GME shares because I for a second thought that you dumbasses had the patience to make this squeeze an actual play. When I saw that it wasn't up 10% every day I should have known the short squeeze would never work. You guys don't have the discipline.
Bee   gang? Ap t gang? Where are yall at?

Youre dumb af if you think PLTR is dead
Man. Reading these comments hurts.

Fucking retarded noobs in here. They see red and freak the fuck out. You think the market is only fucking green? You can't make money if it never dips you dip shits. You fucking make the numbers in your account go up when you buy when it's fucking red and sell when it's green. Or you know, for the opposite at the same time by shorting to doubly capitalize.

You fucking regards buy when it's green and sell when it's red. How fucking retarded are some of you? Put down your god damn phone before you sell and lose your wife's bf's rent too.
Guy on CNBC: minorities are awesome people.

 
CRSR with a price target raise to $44.  Lets see how much it falls on the news... 
I truly, sincerely hope you PLTR boys learned some things about why diamond hands is a meme, how to play meme stocks, and why buying IV >200% is very bad. Hopefully you become a better trader because of it. Shit, I hope you're green overall on the trade.

Just stop being retarded  :)

HEAR YE, HEAR YE

YOU IDIOTS HAVE ONE LAST DAY TO GET ON THE STARSHIP DISCA BEFORE WE LAUNCH OUR DISCOVERY MISSION TO THE FAR REACHES OF SPACE
Everyone so bullish but failing to remember Powell testifies an hour after the open. Enjoy the morning pump but not for too long.
Why the fuck NKLA is trading 40 cents higher than what the PM opened at is god damned beyond me.

My position has plenty of time left, but wtf guys it should be solidly below where its at by far.
We're ready for JPOW to talk abut his powerful tools today.

Before you hate my small PP, I also have calls on my main account.
BB is gonna be the next big meme. i can just feel it
You retards better get started on memes recapping 2020 for wsb.

If Powell isn't beating the living shit out of a bear in at least one, I'll be highly disappointed and my day would be ruined
Why y'all are betting for meme stocks,  MRNA has been gaping up 10% every day.

THis sub belongs here
Gonna dump CRSR calls at open. This stock is just going to float where it is until next earnings. Totally useless.
Are NIO and XPEV the same?
Feeling like a SPY 370 kind of day.
APHA !!
If youre gonna buy puts every day we pump to ATH youre gonna be buying a shit ton of worthless puts this month.

APHA Is gonna hit 12 by EOY

i mean, it sure seems like SPY $365p 12/31 would be a reasonable thing to purchase at open
CNBC reported that Slack takeover would be close to $30B. Its currently at $24B. News coming after close today.

MMs are definitely gonna fk with us on TSLA. They will probably try to shake us out around 9:45... then may be resume back to mooning.
AMD or PLTR LEAPs? I need to decide in 9 minutes.
Dat boi do be thicc tho
Should I sell my 800c 12/31 TSLA for a measly 200$ profit at open? OR, does papa Musk still has some juice in the battery pack to fuel us to new all time highs?
All in on Blackberry
Can't decide if I want to day trade MRNA or ZM.

Either going to buy MRNA calls on the dip or ZM puts on the spike.

Any other interesting plays?

BNTX calls on this dip look good too, especially with the meeting coming up on Dec 10th. MRNA is the superior vaccine but BNTX has big pharma and the jump on MRNA. It will be the first, which is a big deal when the whole world is watching. Not sure if BNTX is a good day trade, but definitely a good monthly play if you're willing to DCA a little bit.
If youre posting a picture of your position

This is the last time I will ever put more than 10% of my portfolio into weeklies... all of this could have been avoided. Down over 50% this week. One thing I noticed though is that there is alot less pain since I was in the same boat only 2 weeks ago. Climbed out of that hole and now im back in it digging myself even deeper.

Were some possibly decent PLTR buy opportunities today for the long term, 3 days in the red and look at the volume, can definitely see it take off somewhat. Or not.
Why is BB up 50% lol
No biggie, Disney now at all time highs of $151+. Told y'all last night: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k48jqi/support\_the\_mouse\_and\_buy\_dis\_ahead\_of\_december/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k48jqi/support_the_mouse_and_buy_dis_ahead_of_december/)

AMZN's making a small run.

edit:  bought a 3200 dec4 call when AMZN was at 3190, and sold when AMZN hit 3217.  May go up more, but I'm happy for now holding my longer term dec and jan debit spreads + stock.  If we have an intraday dip, below 3200, may try my hand again, but def. not for certain.

Name a single ticker that has government contracts, deals with the DoD, and is a tech company, and is less than $50. 

If you have shares of PLTR, fucking hold. They just increased their guidance. If you have weeklies, that's a rip.
PLTR you stupid idiot why you going the wrong way
Mr PLTR, I don't feel so good :/

Dropped PLTR calls and picked up AAPL weeklies. Please let me not be a moron.
Fellow Palanteneers, today is the third and last day of red. Tomorrow we fly, just like CRSR*

* 
Not an investment advice
PLTR ripping
Million and a half members of this sub and I took an Econ class in high school about 12 years ago but heres the game plan. Everyones sad about their PLTR calls and theres a quick way to fix it 

1. Turn on margin
2. Buy as many shares of PLTR
3. watch your calls print money bc of demand
4. ???
5. Idk I dont have another step I didnt think Id get this far
Can you retards all buy bb calls and push that baby to plus 100%?
I root for everyone on this sub to win.  

Except 
Remember the retards saying "PLTR 40 EOM"
All I am gonna say is this.  Be careful today.    This has weird tingle spider feels of a bull trap setup.    We had the weird market panic selloff yesterday almost everywhere to give everyone enticing positions and now a massive 9 inch green dildo futures to bring back the money.   Keep your fuckings eyes on VIX and the news, dont over expose yourself by getting locked in on reckless PDT trades early.  be safe retards
Fuck it.....PLTR baby lets gooooo
Before using Palantir the army would map out insurgents locations *by hand*. Every branch of the US military trusts Palantir to the extent that they use their platform to analyze data. Foreign countries are employing Palatir's technology. Palantir is building relationships in civilian industries at record pace the past few years, all I can say is get in bitches. Also what is more American than saving American soldiers lives? 
Reloading the clip.

I hate people who say buy the dip. As if we have infinite money to buy dips and if we have infinite money then why will we need money. We are fully invested over leveraged infact so stop f saying to buy that dip again or I will slap you
I finally understand "being jacked to the tits", that phrase from the movie Wolf of Wall Street. It's an indescibeable feeling of being all in max leveraged and having the market(or at least futures) go your way. That's what got Ryan Gosling's character to be jacked to the tits.
Amazon chooses **AAPL** over MSFT

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-ec2-computing-instances-running-apple-macos.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-ec2-computing-instances-running-apple-macos.html)

  

AAPL $135 EOW
Lockdowns are coming whether you like it or not. This will be the final nail in the coffin for most of the remaining small businesses. Though this is good news for big corporations, I hope government officials do some serious soul searching for telling their constituents that they can fuck off and die.

Nio with another month of record deliveries. Watch out boys
ZOOM earnings per share of 99 cents. Giving the shares a **p/e of 450!!!** That's 450 at arguably peak pandemic and as competition will only put further pressure on margins from now. Good company but utterly absurd share price....Do yourself a favour folks and **do not buy this dip**!
Sold all my SPY calls yesterday at a loss

GME infinite squeeze hype sure died off quickly
Still. Not. Fucking. Selling
Market dont give a shit about poor people or small businesses going under.
Sold aapl to buy pltr just now. These are the hard decisions you gotta make to beat the market.
PLTR with the usual pre-market false hopes
So far in the last 5 days, I've seen critical mass meme'ing of PLTR, a guy that that had no idea what time markets open, thots hopping in, SPY sitting at ATH, schizophrenic rotations. Trump is pushing a trade war as hard as he can in his last days in office, with some real momentum from the Hold Foreign Countries Accountable Act. Imma say these are some scary signs and we're on the verge of something. Imma pussy out and go cash gang after today 
I sold my AMD shares yesterday to FOMO into GME and PLTR and immediately lost all my gains in two days I am a

Down ~15% on GME and I aint selling because I was promised a 5000% short squeeze 



Edit ~20%

*ImAgInE nOt MaKiNg mOnEy tOdAy*

Someone has to lose for you to win 

#duh

Im thinking pltr drop to $22-$23 and then right back up we go.  This stock has massive massive potential for y/y.  I bought the hype but Im holding this baby forever now.

PLTR about to take the elevator up!
Is PLTR officially dead?
GME was not a mistake. Its called a pullback. Its called cooling off RSI. Get out if you cant handle being down. It will go back up lol. Some of yall have zero patience and think itll only go up. Relax, look at the indicators, look at the volume and it should give you a pretty good idea where this is heading.
I freely admit the PLTR stuff that permeated the sub was obnoxious, but buy this dip if you like money. This isnt a half-assed weed stock. I dont think this drop lasts.
Pltr is dead. Fuck this
What's going on with Li auto?? 4 dollars after hours!!

Thinking of getting leap puts on gme do yall think it will still be in business in 2023?
[deleted]
Legitimate question. Let's say a stock is trading at $100 with zero volume. If I bought one at an intentionally higher price I.e. $110, since it's the only volume on the chart, would the stock price then change to $110?

What time is Jerome speaking and should I sell before he does?
STOCKS GONNA BRRRRR
So SPY has gained 35 bucks in the past month, meaning there is a chance we could potentially hit 400 by New Years if it continues to have a strong month. I'm thinking of stopping this weeklies yolo shit I've been doing and instead buying 15ish 1/4 calls in the 375 range and let it sit to see what happens. Any good reason not to? It'll be a long month of waiting and some angst if and when SPY dips when it does, but the *potential* to turn 3k in to 15k or more (25k if it does hit 400 by 1/4) in a month's time seems too good to pass up.
BB to $15
Where is the vaccine news? Send this bitch to the moon!!!

Damn NKLA puts should have been a no brainer.

I shit you not. I was looking at some of my PLTR shares on RH(phone) and my dogs were play fighting near me and they somehow sold my shares. Still made some profit..

Good thing PLTR plummeted more.
Pltr ruining lives 
Retards didn't realize a short squeeze on a meme stock consists of putting your balls in a vise and twisting until explosion

Exit your positions and park it in LUMN. You know Michael Burry hasnt let us down before.
Gme plummeting
So.... I've been looking at nokia and their website and such..... they seem to be poised to take off. They seem to be trying to make their brand fantastic imo. They have a nokia smart TV, they have their phone line, they have nokia labs, and they are a 5 g play. Are they under valued? I may add long dated calls and shares once my job pay kicks in. What do you guys think.
I wonder if deepfkingvalue have closed his position or not
I really love losing money
If PLTR drills a bit more I might actually re-enter
SPY and QQQ mooning. My AMZN and TSLA calls plummeting
The only green in my portfolio is boomer AAPL and fucking airline stocks
Vaccine stocks are the play. Actual reason to have their prices pump over the coming weeks. MRNA is too hot for me but BNTX is poised for another breakout. EU approval any day now. It's going to fucking blow.

APHA $10 Jan calls free money
Welp Bois I'm still holding palantir I guess, got calls out to Feb 19th and tbh I already made decent gains on it so if I lose all these I'll be okay
This is why I hold AAPL and SPY leaps.
Why Tesla? Just why
GME Short Squeeze has turned into GME Long Liquidation 
VIX coming back up. Fed sound like gay bears.
The only things green are my weed shares ....WHICH MEANS IMMA BUY MORE WEED SHARES
The fuck is this shit? Indices mooning while meme stocks dying
The end is nigh
I would very much like Tesla to make a grand appearance hitting $600 today. That would be fun!
Why is my baby Tesla being beat up
WTF BABA
The MORE Act is being voted on tomorrow to a Democrat-controlled House. Y'all think it's a good time to invest in weed stocks?
There are so many people on this sub holding PLTR calls that expire within the next 2 weeks. The loss porn will be insane.
Is there a real delisting threat to Chinese stocks?
I really think that EOY rotation goes towards TFAAANNG. All but Tesla have been in a 3month range and all other sectors melted up in November. People want to reposition and position for 2021 so theyll look for value and growth. They will find it in TFAAANNG.


Tesla

Apple
Amazon

SPY 370 thursday on renewed stimmy hopes
If anyone has doubt about CRSR, just look at LOGI. Dropped to mid 70s after earnings call (even after reporting stellar numbers) and rebounded back to upper 80s and still climbing. 

Conclusion: This sector is    

Also, CRSR is still cheaper in valuation than LOGI when you look at Price to Sales ratio
Greed is NKLA being down $3 and Im still not satisfied enough to sell my puts.   
I just bought my puts on NKLA, fellow retards that means its time for you to buy calls, youre welcome.
Boomers feasting today
Does GME have any gaps need to be filled?

APHA with the pump then dump even harder
In the midst of my positions-green, all the meme stonks are bright red...  what happened wsb?

$RKT can go to hell, fuck this stonk for just sitting at $20.
I moved my entire portfolio into 2021 weed ETFs
I made enough selling my PLTR shares that Im not gonna lose money but this $34 12/4 call is not doing so hot. If I had woken up 10 minutes earlier yesterday I would have made a ton
Up 22% today, nearly 200% on the month. fucking beautiful. 5G was the best play
NIO, Announce you thought this growth shit through and you gonna build 3 giga factories spawning cars faster than zerglings!

Do it now Ryan Cohen!
How many times do you degenerates have to lose your weekly pay check to thinking here comes the pump?
The sudden run up and then slowly trickling down is one of the reasons that gives me trust issues
Why is Tesla acting like a bitchhhhhh?
AMZN bleeding into red while Blackberry up 40%. What a meme market
This sub is something else man
Calls on PLTR. Puts on Spy. Damn iM sMaRt
[deleted]
Why is the auto mod telling me Im in the 10 percentile. Bar not set very high or sum? Upon further inspection I read it wrong and read it as if it was saying 90th. Carry on.
RIOT anyone?

Its a dump and pump game
It snowed over night so I bought $15K of SNOW. The snow in my yard is going up, why is SNOW not? Am I doing it wrong?
Buy the dip F@&&ots!
What the heck? Hold on it's a dip either buy or hold why panic? TSLA still strong. I can sell my 530c right now but I'm diamond hands. Even though AMZN killing me I'm diamond hands. Just hold if you got shares don't be gay bears
Careful guys theres no backstop on TSLA until 570
Nio gonna v shape like usual
Stuck between my greed and my common sense thinking about pouring another grand into GameStop shares
Nice, out of 3 open positions 2 are bleeding! Glad i kept 2k on the sidelines because that's all i'll have if this shit doesn't stop and recoup, with PLTR above 30 and GME around 20, by EOM. THC-Baby is a slow burner and the warrants will never rot, so i'm ok with it dipping a little, but damn, why does it have to dip?
For those new, you should look forward to red days. Red days are the days TO BUY not 3 weeks into a run.
BB on the rise!
We gonna stop getting butt raped now?
PFE looks like a great entry here. Obviously a lot of news and profit potential with the vaccine, but also there was much greater bull volume this morning than the bear volume on consolidation, I'm wagering we end up going higher and having a little bull run.
CRSR please moon at open tomorrow
I still believe Tesla 600 + EOW
who else is ready to move back into RKT?
PFE is actually making me money 
Oh damn BB
What is holding SPY up? Confused face.
Jpow finishes and we pump

Holy shit what the fuck happened to Moderna 
Well overall, Im up like 50% on PLTR. Couldve been 4x that but cant be angry with gains right?
PLTR 31c dragging down my portfolio
Just dropped 2k more in GME.  
To the moon.
NKLA traded 49% of yesterdays volume so far in only 20% of the trading day. Yesterdays volume was over 15 times what is normally is. Today is already around 10x normal volume

DUMP ALERT

i dunno about  you guys but i bought the dip
About to $ROPE
How do you hit the undo button...
Gme dead stonk ??
Since TSLA got the nod for SP500, ZM should be next. It's now the largest market cap not in the index, has 8 profitable quarters in a row, good liquidity, low-risk/positive credit rating. Telecommunications, distance education, telehealth should see continued growth even post-pandy. Plus there will plenty more pandemics in the near future anyways. 375-395 target btfd price
wait so planters peanuts won a contract with uk for immigration control and is drilling? fucking andrew left and his shity opinion
BB is the new meme stock.
TY for the dip GME

Something's about to blow the fuck up
I have lost many times with SPY puts through 2020, but today yet again, stupid bear as i am, i can not help thinking, how big brain good play 4/12 360p might go?
Im honestly really starting to believe the market manipulators got the prices down on NIO , Xpeng, baba, and JD because they know its about to blow up during the Biden presidency and they wanted in lower. This is wild but Im kind of loving it really its like a redo for everyone who missed out initially. And yes for today, let the bears eat cake instead of the dumpster

Before you make your next bet, search for reasons NOT to make the bet and see what you find.

For those of us that pay attention to the markets more than I would say the average person does, we stand a real good chance of seeing some once in a generation maybe greatest ever amount of crazy shit financially between now and middle of February which I think is the earliest you might actually get a stimulus passed and money moving.

PLTR was the kinda thing you shouldve gotten in on around the same time NIO started to pop off. Still hopeful for the future though 
I think the PLTR bubble is over for now. It's a $25 to $30 stock.
My gut says PLTR is dead but my PLTR 30C 12/24 have so much time on them that I can't give up on them for a 40% loss.
  
The lack of patience some of you noobie traders have is incredible. You will never make money chasing 10% moves every day. Stop staring at 1 minute charts, go outside, jesus...
I wanted a gme dip at opening so I could buy more.
But since everything else dipped too, I could barely get extra shares.

Tim wakes up it's the weekend after thanksgiving. his bff from work sends him a txt in excitement "LOOK AT THIS" he clicks the link it takes him to a forum, He don't really understand any of it, every thread says PLTR gains. Tim dives deeper, people are making a lot of money. Life changing money. buying something called calls on PLTR. It's a stock. Tim's Dad knows all about stocks.  
30 min till work. He run downstairs and try to explain to his dad this PLTR and Calls, then shows him the link. Dad seems unsure but says he'll give it a shot. he copys someone elses play but notices this 12/4 $35 call is really cheap at only .13 cents. "what a steal" he buys 100,000 contracts at .13 thinking it's shares. "This isn't too bad". 
Tim rushes down the stairs in his Wendy's uniform. Did you do it Dad? "Yes son, I used a little bit of our savings to test the waters" Nice! exclaimed Tim.  
Tuesday:  
Tim and Dad are staring at the bronkerage screen in despair. I don't understand! What's a margin call ??? why are they calling me? Tims dad calls the bronkerage, they explain to him why he's a dumbass and why he should have never visited that forum. Tim breaks all ties with his bff who sold on Monday and took his monster gains. Tim cries everynight as his father stares at the locked gun display on the mantle.  
Wed:  
Tim still sobbing puts on his Wendy's uniform.  
Dad staring blankly puts on his Wendy's uniform.

Hey. RH. If I pay a monthly membership fee, I want unlimited access to the articles you filter to me. Puts on RH IPO.

PLTR:  Thoughts on where it goes by 1/15/20.

Tech is the only hope
Damn VIX is almost back to pre-covid lows.
VALE gang coming back from the dead my boysss
Blackberry is pumping because it got an AWS contract to develop an intelligent vehicle data platform and thats real but damn if it doesnt feel like peak bubble market. Say the magic words data platform, aws, then insinuate something about EV implementation, and baby you got a multi million dollar pump on your hands.
I created a RH for my girlfriend and gave her 100 bucks and Im going to see if we can do better than my own personal account.

This kind of clown. Claws back 30% but lost like 1/2 th of my profile. 

What did we learn kiddies?

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DAY TRADES AVAILABLE BEFORE YOU YOLO!
Pull up your big boy pants and quit panicking over the morning dip for christ sake

PLTR MOONING CMON BBY YESSSS!!!
GME coming back for revenge 
PLTR bros look to CRSR for your eventual fate

SPY and VIX going up together - be very very careful guys
Mark my words: Market is going to sell off during/after Fed conference.

Grab some FD puts before then.
Stimulus talks back on the menu. 
CRSR is back baby 
What is happening GME? Are we buying this or what?

Goodbye GME
 EV sector profit taking lmao goodbye nio, xpev, blnk
Fuuuuuck NIO ded
Hi my autistic brothers - Pepe the retard with an update: bought PLTR hype, kept buying the rocket fuel, wide eyed my glorious green options (first option plays), played more (casino), and now its all red. Very red. Ooofff - still dont know what the fuck IV really is but I know It is fucking me  - best lessons are the most painful ones! Keep going idiots!
I remember this is why I took a 4 month break from the market. It's so gay and boring on hard mode
Please stop! YOURE HURTING ME 
*cue music*
Im just a bull and Tuesdays a nightmare!
PLTR cant go up until all the weak hands are shaken out and all the December calls are busted.
Thank god I didn't go super autistic and put my faith in a dying company like GameStop
Is this where everyone comes to find out what **not** to do? NIO, PLTR, GME, NKLA
Fuck it buying this NIO and PLTR dip
Are we all still sleeping on PSTH?
Didnt I say this weekend everyone should start buying up AAPL because it was about to take off again?  Dont miss out. M1 chip is killing it. HomePod mini is killing it. iPhone 12 is killing it.
SPY and VIX are rising..you know what that means..the whole market about to dive!!
Just averaged up on PLTR. 26$
PLTR GME

NAW  YALL REALLY DOING ME DIRTY!!
"AWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a users needs and preferences," says Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services. "Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry."

BUY THE BLACKBERRY DIP YOU FOOLS.

It's an EV play and the masses don't know it yet. This is the perfect set up for a retard strength rally.
Fuck this. I can never time the market. All in shares and forcing myself never to look at the market again. With options, you dont just lose money, but tons of time and energy spent stressing and thinking about how much I would have had if I didnt sell. Its just not worth it.
GME with a textbook 15 minute dead cat bounce. Make sure y'all study that in film session.
bagholders everywhere   
me included 
BB puts for next week printing
happy i sold pltr prior to the shitstorm
Can you fucking yanks hurry up and pass the godamned stimulus for fucks sake..
Tesla gonna hit a V shaped recovery, I can see it now. Its just shaking out the paper hands
Fake dump
I feel like we don't mention enough that you gigantic fucking idiots turned a mentally unstable weeb with fake hair into the world's second richest man this year because he makes good memes, tequila, and ok electric cars. .
PLTR puts are PRINTING
These GOP senators aint giving out any more free money.
If you get shaken out that easily from positions you deserved to be cucked
Morning dip then an afternoon rip. Lets get on it!
PLTR and TSLA calls were on sale today (still are)
Doubled down on my PLTR puts, gotta love making money both ways
Pltr looking like a good buy at this price imo
With serious honesty, yall think PLTR will recover? Asking for shareholders not autistic option gamblers
By the end of the week, PLTR will plummet back to levels not seen since...

Last Tuesday.
I bought PLTR shares in my boomer portfolio around 22$. Should I liquidate it? I really dont want losses on a meme stock
[This is why NIO is falling](https://www.investors.com/news/china-stocks-delisting-threat-grows-for-alibaba-nio-house-vote-kandi-fraud-allegations/)
BB new meme stonk
Who else is down biggly on tesla rn
AAPL goes up $1-2 and this sub loses their mind.

"aApl MoOnInG"

... kind of true for this specific ticker though.. shit never does well.
BB is going to annihilate the remainder of the meme gang after pltr and nio took out 80% of yall
APT BREAKOUT INCOMING
NIO 50c 12/04
AMD actually just running
Threw 20k into 2022 NIO 80c...
When is pltr going to stop? 
GME: maybe, maybe not, maybe fuck yourself.

I aint selling though.
PLTR will be huge can't believe ppl believe Shitron with their market manipulation bullshit
I thot Facebook was social media how cum It is also a stonk?
As soon as a stock goes quiet on here, its time to buy and hold. Its gonna go up and everyone here will have exited and will fomo back in pumping it higher and the subsequent drop wont be as bad as the last. Rinse and repeat
AAPL calls are printing 
I was going to make a whole post about this, but if you guys want long term PLTR calls but dont have enough money to get them- get **3/19/21 43/44 call spreads**. I got filled at .15 with max gain of 1.00 at expiry.
Load the boat in Tesla
Okay so why is It I bought some 670c 12/4 TLSA calls at 3:51 yesterday with the underlying share price being $567 and the share price is as $580 and I am losing money?
Need NIO to hit 50 and PLTR to hit 27.
Hey NIO if you could break 48 that would be greattt. Thanks
Is GME dead?
If I hit $500k before year end I'll buy that Belle Delphine used condom lol just to burn some money
Sell your shares already Milton nkla is fucked. Burn it to the ground. Oh wait youve never built anything that  you can sell. Shit.
I'd imagine the same people who bought PLTR above 30 also bought GME above 18 
What is the rationale on banning all talk of SPACs? Only a few days ago the sub was pinning any and all retarded DDs relating to SPACs. I hate how flip floppy the mods are with things like this, just makes it seem more like they're coordinating pump and dumps rather than trying to prevent them like they claim.
What do you guys think BB will end this run at? I'm gonna guess 13 or 14, conservative
This is the time to buy PLTR
$TSLA CEO ELON MUSK SAYS THAT HE WANTS THE AUTOMAKER TO FOCUS ON PROFITS AND COST-SAVING - ELECTREK, CITING EMAIL TO EMPLOYEES

It's because of an apple that we know how to counteract gravity

AAPL to moon $135 EOW
Anyone not buying PLTR under $25 hates money
[deleted]
Be very careful buying calls this morning with short expiry. We have already pushed up extremely high on market grid. You may buy the peak and either get fucked by theta or two we push down before ending very close to 1%

Just a thought for this morning
SPCE might be the next meme stock with all the catalysts on the horizon
Taking the L on my PLTR call then YOLO everything on AAPL weeklies then YOLO back into PLTR leaps. I truly belong here.
Tesla to 640 today!
Palantir premarket is fading, does that mean we are gay
Ok heres my last offer to you all, NIO and Xpeng still at great prices but in now before they skyrocket after today. You have been warned...again. Good luck. Oh and dump your weed stocks by lunch time unless you wanna get dumped on
yo, the sun dont shine forever, but as long as its here, then we might as well shine together. 
Rotation out of PLTR back into CRSR
PLTR $28c 12/4s secured. Get in if you like money pussies!
First week ever stock picks and exits: 

PLTR  +50%

GME  -15%

Thats me retired from the game boys. Completely unejonyable week of watching youtube videos, reading bullsht articles from analysts who havent a clue. Although must say this forum was a blast -  [Open-Ad7777](https://www.reddit.com/user/Open-Ad7777/)  out. ****
GME generously giving slow cunts endless opportunities to get in before the blast off, dont be an idiot
GME is on sale right now!
Gotta admit i bought GME kinda blindly without reading too much about WHY it should go up.

Like, who the fuck buys games at a gamestop anymore? What's the deal?

EU regulators to assess the Pfizer/BioNTech jab on December 29, a delay of a week compared w/ timelines discussed last week. Moderna shot to be reviewed in January. EMA confirming, update out shortly

Corn isnt looking too good today.
For everyone who isnt up to speed. EUA recommendation for the Pfizer/bntx vaccine is Dec 10th which could see full FDA approval that day, if not a week later, the 18th at the latest. Buy calls accordingly.

Fooking  TSLA and HEXO calls, let's go! PP so hard right now!
I'm still mad I didnt get into FVRR/UPWK earlier, those freelancing stocks are on a rampage. I got into FVRR around 130, I see all these " I paid $xyz for fiverr to make me a ..." videos constantly on Youtube.
Gme earnings tank or moon?

When ARK says theyre buying anything .. looking at you AQ
FSLY is like ol reliable, with no TSLA-like moves, but steadily increasing in value with good support.  Pretty boring but secure.  Got some $90 calls.  So anyways I think Im gonna day trade Titan Pharmaceuticals, which has been getting demolished and did a 30-1 reverse split.  That may be retarded

Bought SPY calls yesterday. Now I just need a Cat vibing to Ievan Polkka meme to properly celebrate.
NGA time today
Knowing when to sell is so hard. Thinking about selling near ITM CCs on my shares as an exit strategy. Any way this could go sour?
Market is gayer every day
I havent heard a single peep from ZM calls/puts holders...what gives?
Is it stupid to buy deep ITM options to ride the huge delta? or is the premium not worth it? In other words, better to buy 1 deep ITM call or 2 cheaper ATM calls of the same stock? Considering same exp date.
Anyone else concerned that Atlas is gonna tell the world his shoulders are getting tired this morning and spook the markets?
Thinking SE about to break out of the $160-$180 range

No idea why there is so much hate for BlackBerry

the shorts were supposed to come out when they had nearly no products and were acquiring other companies during their transition to an enterprise software company while pissing away smart phone market share.

Now we have a shred of evidence to convince us all of that might pay off, and suddenly I see BB bears for the first time ever.

LOL, do some DD my friends...
How many extremely ignorant investors are screaming BTFD for ZM? 

I feel like there has to be a lot considering ZM got bid up a lot with no considerations for future growth. Like YoY growth looks big, but guidance is pointing to much slower growth in the future.

Here is Papa Musk's mail in full. If you are buying TSLA now you are up for a hard reckoning.

"At a time like this, when our stock is reaching new highs, it may seem as though spending carefully is not as important. This is definitely not true.

When looking at our actual profitability, it is very low at around 1% for the past year. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude thats not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffl under a sledgehammer!

Much more important, in order to make our cars affordable, we have to get smarter about how we spend money. This a tough Game of Pennies  requiring thousands of good ideas to improve part cost, a factory process or simply the design, while increasing quality and capabilities. A great idea would be on that saves $5, but the vast majority are 50 cents here or 20 cents there.

In order to make the electric revolution happen we much make electric cars, stationary batteries and solar affordable to all.

Thanks and great working with you as always,
Elon"

Tesla will be like 1.2% of the index, that means s&p funds will have to sell 1.2% of their stocks between now and dec 18th, so that they can buy tesla stock.

If a stock is in the s&p, expect a dip or maybe even a crash in the next 3 weeks.

Trade accordingly.

Every morning I wake up, look in the mirror, and shed a single tear for not buying PLTR at the earnings dip to 13.
PLTR is holding the low of yesterday (24.04) and bouncing with nice lower wicks at 24.50. Needs to break $28 to change the hourly trend back to the bulls. I'm anticipating a tightening range between 24 support and 28 resistance into the end of the week
Im just gunna chill for now and come back to brag about the NIO Xpeng surge after it happens. To those who know whatsup Ill see you on the moon, to everyone else...good luck. Bears enjoy your cake today youll be hibernating soon
PLTR still probably 30 eoy
What if market goes flat with Biden presidency

if my account went from 11k to 20k to 5k to 11.8k. how does taxes work. im just happy im up 800 dollars this year. took me half a year to recover from 5k to 11.8k just through shares.
those pictures of the planes "transporting" the first covid-19 vaccines on CNBC are so funny. "40 million vaccines ON THEIR WAY" and nobody wants it hahhahaa.
PLTR gonna be above 30 EOW, I aint worried
"This deal is not good for the short term investor in Nikola, but exciting news for the long term investor, there is absolutely no doubt that Nikola will succeed now, the existing BIG investors can live with this, it gives Nikola access to ground braking technologies, Nikola can assure its fully booked orderbook incl. the Republic deal, which will probably grow a lot.
Now its just full focus on what this was all about to begin with." - big brain
I just dont get why PLTR is such a huge meme rn, it runs 3% and people lose it lol. There's stocks that are up 60% already today if you just want to go full meme
BUY AND HOLD GME GUYS
Bears bet against America and worship Fauci. They pay for that every day

I love how the bears in here are trying to scare people from getting into NIO and Xpeng with the big nothing burger Chinese audit bill that wont even do anything for 1. Three fucking years and 2.

Watching all these newbs get gutted on PLTR is like that scene in *Fight Club* when Ed Norton beats the absolute shit out of the pretty blonde kid
The amount of panic selling on NIO and Xpeng really shows me how retarted people are about reading into things. The bill is not going to do fucking anything even to shit Chinese scam companies for 3 years. Thank you for your illiteracy and panic selling youre making me rich with amazing positions in my shares that will bounce back after this BS clears up
Not a single mention of PLTR!! Where are all the howler monkeys!?

This is the end of the PLTR bubble.

Only comments still kicking around are bagholders in despair ("Should I hold my 12/5 $35c?", "This is just a dip"). Not much discussion about up movement. CERTAINLY no gain porn to attract new bagholders. 

The main risk to this stock short term (before 12/11) is that WSB loses interest. That already looks to be happening.

$23 EOW.
PLTR was never a good investment, its a boomer company with tech ppl dont understand, but it sounds smart, primed for a pump and dump. You retards bid it all the way up to $30 from $9 in a month, and didnt sell?! Bath in your failures and retardedness

Imagine buying the dip on Nikola and selling NIO and Xpeng??? Retarded Americans 
Sold half of pltr and leaving the rest for long term and see if it blows up or not. I will sell crsr when it hits 45. Lost some money but hey at least Im not an insane retard who lost tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars. Idk whos stupid enough to put their life savings in the stock market. Even Jay Z and Kanye wouldnt do that

So is PLTR dead dead or what
I told y'all to buy the BB dip.

Now you have to buy the FOMO and risk blowing up your accounts.

Locked in $500 profit and will look for a re-entry.
Powell literally saying the actual economy needs help. Short term solution needed to bridge the gap until vaccine. Pretty simple.

Well the recovery has been so good markets at new highs. Why do we need more stimulus.
So Andrew Left was right after all? Damn
Lol, NASDAQ now requiring Diversity on corporate boards in order to list there. One of the allowable "diversity" requirements can be "homosexuality".

Brb, I'm going to start telling everybody that I'm homosexual so I can get the inside track on sitting on a corporate board.

Does anybody ever sit down and remember that homosexuality is not really a quantifiable characteristic? Anybody could say they're gay at anytime? Lesbians switch hit all the time.
Full the fucking rug already...
Only dog faced pony soldiers held PLTR
The coming vaccine pump over the next 2 weeks is going to be fucking insane. Imagine very news story just showing the national guard distributing millions of vaccines we are going to the fucking moon.
Kinda want to average down on my 12/18 pltr calls but kinda dont want to risk more that what I already have mmMm
Brroooo wtffff. Cashed out my gme pltr nio puts all for profit. Jumped into bb calls like 50 minutes ago while it was already up 47% Im now up 50% on those calls bro bb is the next meme. Buy that shit now and use a day trade if it tanks. But this might be your only shot I just took a chance and jumped in at 47% gain and still won. Dont get on the meme train too late because that never ends well. But for today push bb to the fkn mooooooonnn

Up 50% on my Jan $125 AAPL calls. Not letting go of this one until end of the month
EARS up 400% Im going all in cuz Im retarded
Ok poors, listen up. 
You know how you can still go green this week? Get in on the next Peter Thiel backed company before it merges.
GMHI is holding the vote TONIGHT to merge with Luminar. When that happens the ticker will flip to LAZR within two business days.
You think a LIDAR tech company backed by Thiel, Ford, and Volvo isnt going to be the next meme stock around here? 
This is my last post on this before the I told ya so next week.

I went off the train when NIO first top $51, since then it just went sideaways, is it worth to jump when it dips to 4X again? Or hardpass
Stripe Talks
Ackman said he held limited discussions as well with Stripe, which he said isn't mature enough yet to go public. That was on sept 4th. Doubt they will suddenly become mature in a few months. PSTH will tank when people find out its not actually stripe. Good luck tho.

lmao the whole market is down, not just PLTR. I swear people in this sub see one dip and think the sky is falling lol
IMAGINE YOU BOUGHT PLTR AT 30 OMG AHHAHAHAHA
Did anyone else see that PLTR bounced when it was down 9.11%...9/11, market makers are trying to message us that PLTR knew about 9/11 before it happened!?!?
One red day and everyone is crying. We've had a month of green days. CHILL.

Red days = buy the dip
Green days = hold/sell

Guys stop bagholding and move to BB before it hits 20
GME is garbage, have you idiots been inside their stores lately? I went to see if they had the ps5 and there was just a sign on the door in a autistic scrawl that said "NO NO NO PS5 or XBOX NO NO". terrible
Nio looks like a total buy right now. This is a big-money driven shakeout. not a scientific analysis, but I think they'll hit the 60s in a month or two, and then we'll see the 100s mid-late next year if we're still in a bull market.
lmao restaurants do not need grants. fucking college grads drowning in debt need grants.
PLTR buy buy buy
Those who keep buying pltr calls = 
I work for a medium sized European Broker. 

73% of customers that bought and already sold PLTR within the last two weeks have lost money overall since they are opened their Accounts. 

82% holding PLTR atm are in profit since they are opened their Accounts.
TSLA will go to 690 and Musk will do a stock split to 420

Anyone know why $SNX (Synnex Corporation) has dropped 50% pre-market? I can't find any news.

Edit: never mind, figured it out. They spun off Concentrix.

Concentrix Corp. (NASD:CNXC) will be added to the S&P MidCap 400 effective prior to the open of trading on Tuesday, December 1. Concentrix will take the place of AMC Networks Inc. (NASD:AMCX), which will replace R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. (NYSE:RRD) in the S&P SmallCap 600 effective prior to the opening of trading on Wednesday, December 2. S&P MidCap 400 constituent SYNNEX Corp. (NYSE:SNX) is spinning off Concentrix in a transaction expected to be completed post close on November 30. SYNNEX will remain in the S&P MidCap 400 post-spin-off. AMC Networks is more representative of the small-cap market space, and R.R. Donnelley & Sons is no longer appropriate for the S&P SmallCap 600.

I know it's a mixed feeling on abnb here but I def plan on trying to get in early and not 'buy the top' then purchase longer dated calls. Feel like it's a good opportunity with vaccines coming out and things opening up this summer
i dont understand why $bntx gets less love then moderna. they have a bigger production capacity (1.5billion doses/2021), the better vaccine (1/3 sie effects then moderna) and will get the authorisatiom 1 week earlier (10dec us/ und maybe 3 days earlier/ dec 29th EU). 

1/2 marketcap, a lot of anticancerstuff im der Pipeline and no patente dispute like moderna.

and no, its not pfizer
What do yall think about bntx

Back to NIO
Some days I think Im smart because I dont buy tsla. A chart pointed up and to the right isnt a good reason to buy a stock. Then I realize Im just buying stocks pointed less up and to the right, and thats really retarded when the boss ticker is out there. 

The point is, Im retarded. Im hope you TSLA tards get rich.
What if BABA decided to run today. 
AAN just had an interesting split and is pretty cheap right now.  Its more than doubled over the past 6 months (155% gain for me since April), so hoping to see it double yet again.

Get in CRSR before it rockets to Pluto. Buy the dip!!! (The price its at now is definitely a bargain)
Letting those Pfizer calls just sit back and relax
Imagine there's a guy that got himself banned from Hong Kong trading for making false and misleading statements, then got sanctioned a different time by the National Futures Association, and their analysis of a company is \*its really volatile\*. Then, they turn around on anything they called a fraud within a month and go long as if the fraud just magically disappeared.

&#x200B;

Now imagine you take his advice and sell a security he targeted :)

INTC up 2 days in a row, I don't see any news yet

TSLA trying to meet 181k vehicles this quarter which is 40k more than their last Q delivery. It might be really hard to do that. So TSLA put for the next earning should be a good play if it holds on to the 600$ share price.

One of the biggest triggers as to why the China Automotive Systems stock price saw a major increase is due to an update on the power-steering product sales to electric vehicle (EVs) makers.

How much less can Palantir be worth??
Munchkin getting grilled
Anyone else skeptical about the online products drop? The Zoomer Doomers are creaming their pants because ZM's gross margin is falling? And this is why I should sell off DOCU, W, SHOP, etc? Fuck that, one good earnings from one of them and they'll rocket ship upwards. 

So here's what we do. Sell an iron condor on ZM below 350 and above 480. Use the credit to finance a slightly otm call on DOCU or your company of choice.
Battery day....buy the top..
All indexes charts indicate a bear trap just concluded.
I just bought some of your palantir meme shares and the 26c weekly for a buck. You guys better not let me down.

**Big money LEAP traders... question:** Are you content to scalp $500 here, $1500 there, or do you hold for bigger moves? I feel like I'm straight gambling (as much as one can on ATM AMZN LEAPs) so I should take the quick gains. But they are small. ???
Is anyone tracking PLTR's IV? It is at 133% now. Is that up or down form yesterday? I'm considering selling a call spread on it.

The long ass DD for gamestop comes down to this:

> This all hinges on Dec 8 earnings. If GME misses (it historically has), Cohen will use this opportunity to attack leadership and take over as CEO. Therefore, GME leadership needs to provide a great earnings report or else Sherman will lose his job.

LMAO this is not a stretch AT ALL.  So first we need to miss earnings (which apparently is a certainty all of a sudden), have the board fire the CEO, and then hire some guy who owned a pet company.

Love simultaneously shilling how great GME is financially but now they will fire the CEO because of a miss after the stock has gone up 500% since April.
If any consolation, NOVA, GTHX and AAPL are of some hope to me

Best time to pump 50%+ in a year is when poor people lose their jobs and either stop contributing or need to liquidate their retirement to survive. Rich get richer, poor get poorer. Be rich or get left behind. We're going to 450! Let's celebrate! USA!

With a debit spread in the money do you hold both through expiration for max gains and RH will handle exercising the buy leg to cover the sell leg? And if the sell leg isn't exercised will the buy leg be exercised and sold at market price if I don't have enough cash to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock?

27 years old, friends are scattered around the country, got out of an 8 year relationship two years ago, spent a year depressed, then when I finally pull my head out of the gutter COVID happens and everything closes. Have a masters degree I just finished up but no one in my field is hiring due to COVID. 

Part of me wants to just go apply to work at a bar to build up more of a social life again. No bars gonna hire now though probably with potential shutdowns looming .

When the market opens, it shows the real interest in the stocks by investors. Whenever it opens, and it dips. It just means that a paper hand sold it, and it create more fear in other paper hands. 

So just hold onto it. As a thread, we can do it if we want.
OK...  suggestion for everyone on this thread.    DON'T blow your wad over the weekend with absurd repetitive pumps on one stock.   YOU told the entire world that you were long.

RULE #1 in trading....  don't let other know what you own.   Markets seek the most pain and for PLTR, it's lower.
Sold all my stocks, sitting today out so I can talk with a qt.

ur mistake! 
Watching PLTR slowly accumulate after being decimated every day really breaks my heart - not my bank account because Ive been shorting this bad boy since last Thursday - but it does break my heart to watch.   Sorry bag holders.  My advice is to cut your loses now.  This only gets worse.
DAILY REMINDER RUG PULL TOMORROW
Hey Cunts! Pay Attention!, You want to fucking get rich on GME??!!  


Today there will be a battle at 17.30-17.51, If you can get this fucking thing above 17.51 and higher pre-market its going to run when market opens, Now how do i do that mr yelling at me man?  


Go onto your Robinwhore accounts and pre market queue up buy orders for single shares at 17.20,17.21,17.22 and so forth, run this fucker up and manipulate its pre market price to the point where the TA boys and the Algo boys have to jump on because its fucking running and the train might start to generate its own steam.  


Or dont and go back to your job and wendies.

Because you can be fucking sure just snapping up all the shares at the current price will end up with you holding bags and the market price being manipulated down 10% by EOD on like sub 8,000,000 volume. They will short this fucker to keep it down today. Run it up.
Reminder - there are a lot smart people here who play dumb, and a bunch actual retards who cosplay being a "trader."  Like this dipshit: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jku4jx/daily_discussion_thread_for_october_30_2020/gam435q/

Good idea to get some puts for ZM this week? Was thinking that tmr will take another big dip
Uhh TSLA?
Yesterdays gains got me browsing Cartiers website
Anyone here NOT buying the dips? By the way, it was a great, green day until Jpow et. al. just had to open their mouths
my favorite stock exploded 30%+ on 26m volume yesterday and nobody knows about it. am i holding a gem here???
Shitron... was... right?
GME is dead. Sell.
SPCE firing today?????
There's no way TSLA breaks 600 today

For everyone that got in AAPL with me a week ago    : https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzfrez/daily_discussion_thread_for_november_23_2020/gddbeyg/
If youre above the age of 17 and still like Palantir you need to take a hard look at yourself. Its time to grow up and join the real world. Its time to be an adult and quit living in your little fantasy land.
I want Palantir to flash crash again today to $24 so I can buy back in
You meme bois think this is bad, wait til the real selling starts. Tech is outrageously overvalued. All equities are, but especially tech...bonds are giving next to nothing. I hate to say it but precious metals and a certain internet commodity are going to be the only things giving any sort of decent return the next 2-3 years
Circuit breakers at 2p today on virus fears. Strap up! 
all poos r pees but not all pees r poos
Im petrified to make a move. The real traders in wsb that make money arent basing it on *luck*. They use indicators and stuff on SPY. options trading is just about going up or down and thats how they navigate through.
Why gamestop...are you gonna pump blockbuster next?
If youre not making money today youre an idiot
These "foodlines" are such total bullshit. You offer free food to motherfuckers they're gonna show up and get it. Doesn't mean their fat asses are starving or can't afford to eat.

Why do I bother to listen to you fucking retards. You helped me make money and now youre helping me lose money. Smh you guys are fucking idiots

More Americans Pay Rent On Credit Cards As Lawmakers Fail To Pass Relief Bill 

CHRIS ARNOLD  NOVEMBER 30, 2020

With their savings running out, many Americans are being forced to use credit cards to pay for bills they can't afford  even their rent. Housing experts and economists say this is a blinking-red warning light that without more relief from Congress, the economy is headed for even more serious trouble. 
There's been as much as a 70% percent increase from last year in people paying rent on a credit card, according to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
"If you're putting your rent payments on to a credit card, that shows you're really at risk of eviction," says Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project. "That means you've run out of savings; you've probably run out of calls to family members to get them to loan you money." 

Marine Madesclaire could be faced with the choice of paying her rent on credit, too.
Before the pandemic hit, she felt like she was hitting her stride. The 29-year-old Los Angeles actor was doing lots of auditions and managing to land at least some quick appearances in Hollywood films.
To pay the bills, she had a gig doing modeling work at Las Vegas trade shows. "You go to the conventions, and you stand and look pretty next to, insert product," she says. "And it paid very, very well. I had been traveling."

But all that stopped in March. Since then, Madesclaire has been among millions of unlucky people who've faced long delays getting unemployment benefits. It appears she should qualify. But it's been more than six months, and she still hasn't received any unemployment money.
"It's been so long that I don't cry about it anymore," she says. "I used to, like, have full-blown meltdowns about it."
She depleted her savings just to eat and pay bills. She's run up more than $10,000 in credit card debt.


Madesclaire has asked her card issuer Chase for help. But she says except for waiving some late fees, the bank hasn't done much to help her. She says the 16% interest is sinking her even deeper into debt.
"They're charging me interest and late fees," she says. "And up until like a week ago, they also were calling me like five times a day until I told them to please stop."
Chase said in a statement to NPR that it has enrolled many customer accounts in "payment assistance" plans. The bank says it doesn't charge them late fees, but it does keep charging interest.
Madesclaire was finally able to find a low-wage job at a computer repair store. But while that just barely covers her monthly bills, she's still four months behind on her rent.
A state eviction moratorium in California will protect her until the end of January, or she says she would have paid her rent on a credit card, too.
"If the choice is debt or homelessness," she says, "I'm going to go in as much debt as I can."
Some people just pay that way for convenience. But for many others it's an act of desperation.

The National Housing Law Project's Roller notes that there's a federal order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention aimed at preventing evictions. But it's not an outright ban, and many people don't know the order exists or how it can protect them. So he says it's not working very well. There have already been thousands of evictions in Houston, Memphis, Tenn., Richmond, Va., Columbus, Ohio, and other areas, Roller says.
"It's bad for public health, it's bad for the families that are involved," he says. "It's bad for all of us as a country."
It could also be just the tip of the iceberg. And it's not just housing rights groups that are worried.
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, estimates about 10 million Americans owe back rent. And without another robust relief bill from Congress, he expects to see "mass eviction" starting early next year.

"Just think about that for a second," he says. "This is all going to be happening in the dead of winter, in the middle of a raging pandemic. I mean, I can't even construct a darker scenario."
Zandi says even if they don't lose their housing, millions of other Americans will fall deeper into debt. And he says so many people continuing to suffer financially will hurt the whole economy.
"I think odds are very high that we're going to go back into recession," he says, "if lawmakers can't get it together early next year and pass a fiscal rescue package."
Zandi says, "It's absolutely critical that lawmakers step up."
As part of the federal aid, he and Roller would both like to see an effective nationwide eviction moratorium, combined with money to pay landlords the rent they are owed to keep them from going under, too.

Price Target for MODERNA?
Bought some MRNA 150C 12/18 yesterday thinking it would blip up by then, didn't think it would be less than a few hours later 
Ill be paper hand bitch and take my profits on PLTR now. Once it becomes less volatile Ill get back in because I still see this stock going $40+ in the near future, but I can't even concentrate on work right now.
When SPY crosses $366 I think I'm going in on 12/18 360p. Puts are cheap with VIX so low...
Okay TA nerds, I know I make fun of you but as a fellow member of TSLA gang, any idea where TA wise the price goes when hedge funds are forced to buy for sp500v

 Help for me pretty please! (re robinhood account)

I'm trying to make a Robinhood account on my PC Web browser (my smartphone isn't working at the moment) but whenever I click on the 'Sign Up' button on Robinhood it fails to load that particular page. Every other page on Robinhood loads perfectly so I'm not sure what's going on. I've tried google chrome, firefox and microsoft edge but the same thing happens on all browsers, all pages on Robinhood load absolutely fine except the 'sign up' page so I can't make an account!

Does anyone have any ideas of why this might be? Or what I can do to rectify the issue?

Thanks in advance lads and ladies, hope you all made lots of monies today.

Yaaassss confirm my biases
Holy shit.

Nice DD.

No body knows qhat it means. But it gets the people going!
Nobody knows what it means. But it sounds provocative
As high level as possible, I believe what it means is that with so many people shorting (betting against) the stock, they can manipulate the stock to look like it's trading lower. But if they're wrong, and time on the short is about to expire, they are forced to buy the stock quickly to minimize their losses. This compounds on itself as short sellers panic to get out quickly and it squeezes it super high up very sharply. So this "war" is battling the short sellers so they're wrong and force the squeeze. Someone smarter than me can correct any of this.
Basically a short squeeze occurs when a large number of short positions are rapidly closed due to growing risk or unprofitability (resulting in a sort of positive feedback loop that forces even more shorts to close). Tons of closing shorts = tons of buying = crazy spike in share price
This

Good boy
bro, energy stocks literally drilled all day yesterday, not a single buyer in sight, and now they are all gapped up recovering almost all of yesterdays losses

straight up magic
Everything was down yesterday, so calls at close seemed like a good idea. And still do...
I was trying to buy TSLA yesterday at close and missed it by 2 seconds because schwab decided to take longer than normal to load the page. not super annoyed but money is money.
Or it could be the smartest the next day who knows 

But just stand by bear the higher it gets the harder it falls
Share your "good idea" with us autists
How much
I sold mine to start wheeling and Im already regretting it a bit tbh. I want to get back in ASAP
That's my boy! Diamond hands!!! We are going back up!

I mean I knew everything else about the company being a scam for months now, but embarrassingly I just put the name thing together yesterday lol
I can't imagine anyone who put more than 10 minutes of thought into that company thought "yes this is legit" but here we are
no one on here thought NKLA was legit, I see your first comment in WSB was a month ago. We've been buying puts for months
Some dudes want to change the world. And some dudes want a bunch of vapid stuff.

Got 2 calls yesterday at 585. Lets fucking go.
Wow bruh
Dont be a coward
You need to sell bc if you can't tolerate a 3% intraday drop you definitely won't hold through a retouch of 15 or lower. Get out you're not made for this trade
It's fine, hold it. It's a long play anyway.
im right here with you bud
i bought the dip. dont fucking sell. these are the shorters
Youll be fine in like 30-45 mins

I'll let you know when I buy puts, that should start the  engines

I started playing at the start of November. Doubles my money plus some. Just cashed out the initial investment.

Welcome to WSB

They try to catch the tail end of it so they can say "I caught the BB run up"
Fuck GME
what were u sayin
This aged well.
Im with you brother
To hold onto it for the opportunity to get rich, be strong brother!
same, i bought GME calls this week fml
If you bought a short term contract I feel sorry for you son
Im kinda mad right now but if it bombs earnings next week Ill be pissed
earnings call is next tuesday after hours, either hey put out a good call and potentially trigger the squeeze (either way it goes up there) or It's a bad call and Cohen buys out and triggers the squeeze himself.

I too am in the 3k club.
Ouchie
join the club
LMFAO
Why u even doing this
Oof, just go double or nuthin on TSLA calls
I was at 1000 last week and now I'm at 930
join the club kid.  mine threw up from above 300k to under 100k... gut check!  Back up over 170k still fucking angry!
Dude just invest and sell covered calls or something dont gamble away 5 years worth of money

My 2k in shares is gonna pay for a house in a couple years watch this space
Checkin in. DIEHARDIAMOND GANG
Sorry WSB can't pump and make up for your bad decisions
It will always be a thing. PLTR is just weeding out the nonbelievers
Nope
I got in at 10.40. Been selling Covered Calls at the peaks and collecting that sweet sweet prem
Thats years away
Just started doing this in November. PLTR and others has me scared, especially since I got in pretty late in everything.
I don't care about their earnings. I'm not investing in their company until they work out how to sell it as software not as a consulting business. Also their earnings just like their S-1 is likely to be deceptive, they don't include FDEs in COGS which is bullshit as most of their money comes from FDE contracts. This over inflates their gross margin (80% my ass) and ignores the main reason they are able to sell into these gov contracts (their FDEs/consultants).

Their product might be impressive (it's hard to tell tbh, they don't provide enough technical detail for me to evaluate it) but until their business changes it has glacial growth ahead of it.
Same lol, Im hoping for some kinda reversal
sameee :/
Lmaooo 
I dont really care if you cry
False
r/investing Thinks that anything that increases more than 7% in a year is a pump and dump.

Here we go baby
Andrew left won
When it goes to 1000 you'll be glad you held
Lol this, still a great long hold just stop fucking with weeklies and sell cash covered puts/buy shares and then sell covered calls
Oh so because Citron said so makes it true? Lmao theyve been wrong many times
how those bags feeling?

Same

Investors who got in 1 month prior giving us newbies with fomo false hope - so bad with money, wtf - no paper hands - Ill take the loss, fml
too many poors making money now they no like that
$43 by EOY.
you forgot. The markets too high. I sold everything at a loss. and am all cash. I will now watch the market climb higher and higher with a smugness of smugs
lol how is that different from people spamming PLTR on WSB 24/7
Its funny because Citron has, in the past two weeks, targeted like 4 companies near ATH. They always put the same garbage out. "Its a casino huuuuurrrr duuuuuurrrr." Stock dips for a few days and then recovers back or even goes higher.
Because the SEC feels bad for him getting cucked
because what we do is not stock manipulation either
Seems like it, it had good support at $27 yesterday though. Going to be exciting to see where it goes.
Time to hulk smash buy button 
PLTR has dropped -5% for three days straight, that's bad
Leave?
Hopped on PLTR for 15 and jumped off at 23. Didnt make the full gain but I aint gonna be a bag holder is my mantra
How 2 profit

You got this man
I hope you get there. Im now up 8 bucks all time for all this stress and not sleeping to check futures and pre market lol
same here
think of all the taxes you're going to save!
40% gains you've beat the market
I'm genuinely happy for you. Please don't get greedy. Sell, take profits.
On paper. Take profits bro.
I wise man once told me the bloody red days lead to the biggest green ones, congrats brotha id even let those ride

If all you did was accumulate, youre going to be fine. If youre doing weeklys then you like getting cucked anyways.

Meanwhile dow is up, revenge of the boomer stocks
More like big money vs WSB
Probably won't, they're dogmatically retarded about this stock and refuse to acknowledge that it's not gonna rally any time soon
i feel like the lesson is go in on meme stocks but dont get greedy, take your profits when things start to look bad. risking it all for another 10% is not worth it
It has tons of room to fall. And it will. But long term this probably isnt the worst place to buy
Would be an easier sell if the market was in free fall.
Mine exp 12/31 still kinda worried tho
Yeah not worried about my Jan and feb, but my 12/18s arent having fun
Im down $50 already 
I was **this** close to telling my dad to put 10K in PLTR after I made 40% but remembered that Im retarded and if he loses his money hell beat me. Look at me, being right for once
funny you mention that. I just wrote a short story about it.
there were so many yesterday

Put holders aren't making much either. IV eats away at any profits. I had a $25p, and it's only up about $80 in this dip
no
There were also a good amount of people warning y'all to stay away.  

People ignored them and chose to be retarded lmao.
and leaps
I was thinking the same thing 40c out in March sounds okay
no money left for ketamine though :,(
Lol thats because you have shares so youre not worried. Probably everyone else here has 40c 12/4
Eh if you have shares and you bought in the 20s and dont mind bagholding yeah you will be fine.
Will read this every time it dips

Support at $22-24 if you look at the 4hr chart.

Below that is around $18 but I don't think it will go that low
You can start scooping up shares as you go too. I wanna do this but my inner gay bear tells me don't buy anything at ATH

What tape??
Where do you see tags?
Who
Its only pixels

they sure take their time...i held BB years ago, and sold at a nice profit, then it tanked, now it is just about where it was when I sold it years ago

biggest problem they have is they are nimble and smart and great with ideas but never enough ammo to get going - and big boys just keep poaching their staff whenever they get going on something....they are like the incubator no one has to pay for.
Idk whats going on with it
Bots?
The Original post said it could take a few weeks so Im holding on but not a lot of movement
Announcement tomorrow and a pop I've heard? If its really that easy for us retail people then the big money would've surely picked up and it by now in anticipation
I have a feeling it may pop AH today
It's been too long fam
Been holding these 4000c june 2021 for almost two months lol
This is the way retard
Just wait.  We will 
pull back before it shoots to the moon!

If the house votes on marijuana this week, it should hopefully shoot up. Sell after the vote or wait until the georgia run off if you believe democrats will win.
I think we're seeing a lot of early November bag holders get out with big sell offs.

Remember it's not just the US House vote. Granted the Senate won't pass, the message that a Dem controlled congress may pass federal marijuana legalization and decriminalization would put a lot of eyes on GA runoffs and people will want to have the bags in hand for that.

Mexico is also making a legalization decision of sorts by Dec 15th. I may hold through US vote unless it really pops.

I'm free rolling my position anyway, sold off half of my APHA/ACB action yesterday for several thousand after 1500 in so let's see if the rest can take us all the way up.

Real talk. Sold yesterday for $100 loss :/ but made it up and some with PFE calls so we Gucci
Right? I really think the whales are bringing out the guns over control

$25-26 is a fair price target at the moment if you can sit patiently on it
buy the dip and 
I went from $280->$7.2K->$1.6K in two weeks.
Hey! Sounds like my October
I did it in 1 week

Yeah I cringe at people thinking they were apart of the squeeze for a couple bucks difference in stock price. Who needsm? We hold the line.
I just bought another 1k worth and I'm tripling that by the end of the week. I'm doing my part.
Shaking all you idiots out who buy options on stocks in a meme phase. But if you like pure gambling with nothing but your gut

Guess who bought NKLA at 35
Buy high sell low baby

Then stop buying meme stocks from WSB
Same man, same. I had been playing it smart last week, FOMOd into PLTR, watched that tank, sold most of the calls I had, put into UVXY, VALE and SPY call and all are negative right now. Although the UVXY is more insurance than anything else.
Remaining 9% during the last 5 minutes
Cant lose money if you dont sell 
anything that a meme can take out is a pretty loose use of the word retirement tbqh
My retirement is entirely QQQ and SPY, with some written calls against them for extra dough.  My re+ard account is a mess of memes.
You stopped it
Look how they massacred my boy
yupp was up like 6k lol now im almost in the red
At least i have shrares...
Shaking out paper hands. holding on both.
I am holding PLTR too. Started buying around 18 with 26 average now.
Bought in at 18, 22 and 32 (lol), 357 shares, avg @ 26. Fuck it, Im holding till I'm rich, or until they're worth nothing.
I am. Also bought at ~18.
Im holding my nio shares, selling covered calls makes up for the loss in equity of the underlying
Same on both actually. Will check back in a year to see my tendies.
Shares? Youll be fine
Im holding... even though its really painful right now.
Facts boomers are straight retarded for peddling that line, if anything it makes me want to quit

Thats literally the most bullish thing that could happen to a stock

The memes coming out of it are going to be great regardless.

Bought a call at open and doubled and GTFO.
sell the BB dip.

Not often you get this much IV on a cheap stock you can confidently sell puts on. Less than 1k if you get assigned and you can then sell calls against it or just sell the shares whenever you want (real brokerages can sell from like 4-5am to 8pm so most of the day you can get out of that position).
He bought? Dump it further

Edit: I'm long PLTR with $12.5K worth of shares avging $18.

Good any decent plays? THC which Ill be able to squeeze some bucks out of every day
Bunch of pussies
Half this sub has such short expiry dates on their options that 5 minutes into the red is already blowing their accounts.
Not even thinking about selling before 40$
I feel this in my soul
jumping up?
Bruh its tanking, I wanna sell too but like shit its gonna be 2k loss
You know for a fact we will make a Greater Depression
Thats not what this sub said a few days ago
Painful
 **EV** SPAC dump day

PSTH is green
Good luck!
Lol this is the honest truth. Ive made the most money by going to shower or keeping occupied
So true 
Buy vxx calls as insurance
probably not

up big on some tech calls that imma sell soon
In 3 mins, do not trade...
If it breaks $20 I'm loading the fuck up on shares.
Think you missed the ship
Whats your date?
Agreed same sentiment. Got in at ~14.75 so I dont mind holding through these dips
Thats the thing. Its not a meme stock we just made it a meme stock anyone who says its dead just simply isnt patient enough.  Does suck watching your long calls tank your whole portfolio tho
I closed out, got tired of watching the slow bleed. Scalping CRSR now.
Yeah I'm definitely buying more if it hits $20
Keep lying to yourself. I do it sometimes myself.
 gainz is gainz my dude
I got greedy and went for same date/quantity @ $10 -- still waiting
My first big win was a random TSLA 900c back in feb.  Put in $200 came out with $9,000.
I nailed it
Let it bleed more.
its just cash - take your few dollars to the penny casino and get it back
Its okay just hold. Theyre only dropping cuz they peaked delivery cap. Theyll expand and hit 1 hundo within the next 2 years
Is aapl even memey enough for this sub? That's a borderline normie stock
Diamond hands
Holding gme shares and calls....
It be like that
COST
Yes
Do it. Went up a lot in sales...
yes
Yes
when everyone's calls expire
Itll be a while
Wait what was that one guy talking about?
also your grandma's house
Same but try 17.88 for me
Hang in there. It's going to be a bumpy week.
This!!! 
*I yell in a shakey hopeful voice*
This is fine
Only way to go is back up
Double down to show your determination  
Yea if it tanks its going down with weed
Is there any news or what?
lieve
Just got to hold through Wednesday
very very sad
No more money :/
I got dips, chips, and 30 calls
I'm getting ass fucked right now too
Sell b4 it's too late
Because we are all staring at the chart and praying to pappa thiel to make the hurting stop
Its with every meme stock
Lol u  our eyes are bleeding what can we do
I think Citron and SoftBank found an easy way to exploit the market at the expense of retail traders. Still opportunity if you can ride the pump and get out before the dump.
Its ok dude we all lost some  your portfolio in future

you spelled had wrong

I HAD $11k...
8 grand, not having fun. But hold brother, it will moon!
sounds like my account.... sigh.
Stop the steal!
not for my 12/4 call spreads lol
Yeaaaaaaa........
Gme gang should be holding shares so theyre fine
There was a comment by a guy that said there is like 1million stop loss at $20 mark.. gues it will never go below that, but you never know
sit tight 100%
Isnt like, a really good company? I definitely dont see it crashing. Hold. It was just on roided retard strength for a while. Itll get back up there.
Sell rn its gonna crash broski
With u on that. 12/31 40c
Its refueling right now
If you lose 10k within a day you deserve to be cut off like the rest of the ameripoors
Whales wont fit in a pressure cooker silly billy
Buy a lot!
Lmao you are literally two weeks late you realize that? Meme stocks almost up more than 100percent in two weeks and you think 5percent gain on AAPL is really good? lol u
and the fact the the shorts are playing hardball, they threw even more money in yesterday and we're sitting green (for now)
Laughing at you for trusting retarded autistic degenerates. This one's on you.
Stop buying after something is already up 50% in 5 days...
Probably for the best guy
LOL
his bio is 'investor'

lmao
I wouldnt say takes the pain away, sometimes I grip so hard I come out raw

Job?

Bro we take 500k loans here and blow it.

I wish I was his buddy
BB to the moon
Welcome to the soon to be BigBoss'es
you better not sell now, there's no way this is the top
Just wait for dips on SPY and buy, just don't buy weeklies. Buy them a few months out. Can't lose. Even during the March crash, you would've been fine.
damn you suck at this - why would you bet 20k on SNOW when you could have placed that into something like SQ PYPL or something
Youll rebound
Post or ban
Hope so I have yolo calls
WHERE DO YOU GO TO FIND YOUR NEWS, WHERE TELL ME WHERE
I'm barely green.  Treasuries really fucking me over today.  Yield must have shot up like a lil bitch.
I am down 150 bucks. I have lots of SPACS kicking my ass.

Yeah hold on a second I thought it was weird we have all these new guys here

Nah they say the crash is imminent even if 2 months have passed since they started saying that
May seem like it, winter is coming. But who the fuck know, they gave us one hell of a Xmas 2 years ago
We all know the rug pull will happen tomorrow
Sell at open. Got it.
whats ur cost basis
Im killing it trading RKT. It moves around a ton in its range, so just join theta gang.
Wednesday and Thursday news pumps virus bear thesis
They are positive but only due to disproportionate weight of tech. Many sections of the market are still down a ton.
Today investors felt like buying stonks.
Economic recovery, do u know how to read mongoloid
AOL's chatbot
brrrrrrrrr
Stonks only go up!
Should be at 400. So technically its down and needs to recover.
Theyre a sell-side organization. They make predictions after the fact
Hasnt announced yet tho right?
English plz
Odds are there will be no dump. Pump will lead to camp and sideways close till tomorrow morning when it can be pumped for another gap up and camp resumed by repeat the next day. This is how the market works. Everyone knows stonks only go up. Jpow even said so
Pussy talk
Stop bragging about your fancy two testicles, some of us had to sell one for money to put on GME calls

60c by EOY wasnt so retarded after all
Nice, grabbed 2 53$ calls at yesterday's lows for 12/11. This should help that print!
This stock is going to $100 by the end of 2021
Got a link to the report, cant find one. 

Been holding shares since $15. NIO never went off the menu
goog putting them to shame.
10 years maybe
Easy. After the next round of earnings reports.
Lol
Yes
You buy more and more aggressive.
Roll it out 12/18 or 12/24
I'm here with you brother luckily my position is small but I've already lost $300.
are we good with calls? I dont want to get rekt again
I have 1,000 shares that I paid $4.61 for. In a Roth IRA too.

AAPL saved me yesterday, hoping to continue the gravy train.
I feel this hard
PFE moons today
I mean, MRNA has a market cap of $60B as opposed to PFE's $212B. MRNA has a lot more room to work with IMO.
its bntx and not pfizer! why do us dont get it?
feel like this is the way 100%. if you can pick winners...

MSFT calls?

Its not just holding. Its gonna pump
What you thinking? 360p 12/7 12/9
This market will keep pumping until December 15th, don't time the drop wrong.
penny pump and dump that's up like 200% in a day. What could possibly go wrong?
Sold a few thousand shares at .60 and thought I won
Where do you think it goes today?
In for a penny in for a pound
today is tits up day for APHA
its up in pre markets
I keep telling myself I'll buy CCL and hold for a year.

Then I remember I hold nothing over 4 days
Can you fucking imagine though. Even thinking about it gives me fomo for more PSTH
620's 12/04 checking in.. HOLD UNTIL FRIDAY
You know it!!
We're going to have fomo on the fomo for the next 3 weeks
670 12/04 lets gooooo
The casting couch "interview" is all they needed you for.
Such bullshit when that happens
GME shares
GME
NKLA puts lol
BABA calls if you don't mind buying feb or later expiry, some IV but not too bad. Recommend 265c or 270c for safety.

U is probably heading for a correction soon if you like gay bear plays.

NIO/XPEV are going to moon hard after wednesday but I would wait on buying calls on those until we see how the vote impacts them, they aren't as robust as BABA so there might be some fallout still.

Just some ideas.
AAPL. Most calls are in the low 30s, even weeklies.
how u catch on early enough?
[deleted]
Ride the meme wave
Puts or calls tho..
agreed. never felt a rush like this before
Buy high sell low boys!
Exactly my thoughts.. surprised these companies are still even around. 

But you know what, BB was one of my faves. If they make a modern phone I'm in
During a pandemic
Mooning downward
No probably not lol 
because we are at all time highs.
Seriously
How low do you think itll go?
damn wish i bought short term, i think i bought mine on wednesday as well, but long dated 4/15 lol. only 130% gainer
I think its a blessing that you cant pay attention to it. Sometimes it screws you up when you keep looking
Congrats on the new job.
Same, people need to buy GME
lol every open it tanks a few points people panic then sell then the smart ones buy the FUCK out everything and we rocket to new all time highs :)
haha my feels..you fell for the biggest P&D since NKLA

Get puts then
inverse yourself
What you got
same as yesterday.... fake selloff and bounce.  Hold the line
Which ones are you selling? I'm in the same boat.
Whered you get this from?
Right? I got all distracted by APHA and now look at me
Mr. u/terribleatlying I dont feel so good.
Printing
Our boy J POW might have something to say about that... but I hope ur right
Dont matter, you were probably already retarded for other reasons. Atleast this one will print.
your    will be rewarded
Probably
I kind of feel the same way , but I'm just feeling the market
Yeeeep
Cant jerk off on red days. 
hmmm
i keep buying, but now I'm scared
Yes
They've been holding it for a week. That's a record around here.
yeah, next Wednesday after earnings
NIO is going to moon really hard after this week. PLTR though... I think that shit is dead.
But now shes got the money to fuck the pool boy on the dining room table and leave her hubby
Holy shit thats a real stock? thought it was just a shitty model
but like actually who was it I remember that too. Don't tell me you bought some
Btfd
Because gamestop is a shitty business what did you expect

Today

2% overall
Theta gang is the winner today. ITM spreads sitting pretty
Literally!!!
Holding mine, but selling calls.
I hold 
Because whats another couple hundred down the drain? 
Whole EV sector is puking!
F, I only got small amounts for meme fun, hasn't gone well lol
Same with pltr. Trust the process I guess
Still me.
They have no follow through.
spacs will recover fast, no worries imo. i bought even more on the dip
Not ideal
Yeah Im holding mine as well. I have them expiring 3/21.
I didn't wanna bag hold my weekly. Cut ties and bought monthlies. Recouping my losses which is good.
If u just kept averaging down youd be well off
What about shareholders 
Next best thing...........bring out the pets and spy puts and calls!
agreed, cyber monday came on tuesday
Seems so juicy but dont want to catch a falling knife
r/investing is that way
I swear, everything this sub touches it goes down earths core!
well spacs really cant drill past their initial price (usually $10) because if the spac fails the money is returned to investors so
rule#1 : inverse wsb
join us at BB
Holy fuck
 bought 10c 1/21/22 on the half day last week.
Which ones and when did you get them? Congrats!
Does it? Is it?
thats not very cash money tho
I lost 30 k on that piece of  stock!
I'm learning to shy away from previously pumped stocks that should be rebounding.  RKT is another example.
STUPID FUCKING BEARS
No one tell him
Me too
Good dd, im in.
Fish face
Open a cash account with TD or Schwab

Day trade all you want with <25k, youre just limited to settled funds
Pretty sure these new blackberry phones are coming with PalantirOS
patience. stop buying thinking it will triple in price in 1 week.
Gotta buy shares to make the short squeeze happen - calls won't do it.
Maybe we should have made more rocket emojis? 
What the fuck is the news? They have a corona vax?
Pfizer has a 220B market cap and its moved 9% in the past week. Volume is low too, how much more do you think it will move?

PRTY has what you are looking for
Mitch McConnell EdgeLord
Its a sad state of affairs
Conservative politicians and donors are financially illiterate retards only propped up by strength of old money and monetary policy.

They will burn the country down before they give any ground.

People forget [American corporate establishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot) planned a coup to overthrow the President and install a fascist government during Roosevelt's term. 

All because they didn't wanna pay extra taxes and still stay rich. 

They seriously preferred another several decades of depressions for the country rather than give concessions on not treating people like cattle.

Truly a retarded ideology considering a country's wealth is derived from the state of the country.
Dems refusing to remove the option for someone to a sue a company for catching covid while on the job. Thats it.
15000 shares in.
Yes if you wait a god damn few days
Yes retard, hold.

If you watch the waves you will miss the tide.
yes
lol when was RKTs last green day
You forgot the E
Straight green would be infinitely more beautiful to me
Holding isnt an issue when you dont wake up till noon.
Too low imo
I'm so retarded I sold TSM to buy PLTR at the peak
I've learned that if you don't get into these stocks before this sub makes them a meme, it's too late.
Same I just sold all my PLTR for a loss.
Lmfao. It's all about  now.
Thats not even bad luck, you bought a stock up almost 200% in a few weeks...
You're not wrong, you're just early, and wrong.
You mean you miss when Spy was the meme index
That's because SPY has been boring since it hit 355+
An hour ago
an hour ago
Tim cock is that you?
Itll be fine after this
Lol same so it all evens out.
Bears only come out during the weekends because those are the only 2 days the market isnt actively going up.  Strange creatures.
Tards never learn.
tbh it did dump after open

Dont worry. Trust in that stock
when everyone here sells, its goin to rally
Get out while you can.
Yes
They will cover the day after you go broke.
Maybe it's just their tax right off and they like the bleed
What was IV when you bought those lol, had to be close to 200% if it was in the last couple days
I sold my put at 9:30 for more than its worth now 
HE FELL FOR THE MEME

KEK
And that guy eating shit
Nio will be back up.....long time bear just put a 59 price on it,,,,prob catching tailwind from the Chinese stock house vote, jumia did a price offering so its down short term......Pltr not sure.....gme is a casino til it isnt
Lmao same
How down are you today?
It's worth examining your emotions when one buys at the peak. Why did you buy those stocks? Do you still believe now what you believed Monday? If so, I say buy more. If not, what changed? Were you trying to ride the momentum? Were you afraid, seeing prices go up, that you'd be left out (FOMO)?
I need to see 600 by Friday lmao im pissed 
thinking the same thing.
Ah fuck man I think you may just get me to buy a 680 FD to look for a pop soon. Might be a waste of 180 but I can feel it coming too
Sold earlier... I made a little bit off it
Then you werent in it for the right reason
Plus after holiday sales too. Rocket ship
This is what I did. When it dipped, buy those 2 month calls and time it after Dec holiday season when everyone will be trying to snag that sweet iPhone 12 super pro max 5G HD *with surgical grade stainless steel*
That's a much more responsible way of saying "stock is too high imo"
Is this real? Seemed fine until those last few words.
When was this
well....okayyyyyy...not sure how I feel about that...get those profits up! or ok, we buy puts?
How are they going to ever be profitable?? Unless somehow they figure out a way to make a 30K car for 10K.

You forgot our favorite game store man
Not even looking til next q
It was only a matter of time lol.
My main reason why I think its going down. There was a big call to arms for Monday and WSB failed. They want us to believe we can move the market so they can steal from us!
I think everyone was either hungover or took the day off. Traffic was nothing yesterday. I bet most of Wallstreet wasnt working.
I dont need to imagine, I am already there. 

&#x200B;

PLTR $45 EOW
Wasn't it a Nio guy holding it for taxes?
Dude is a clown
I feel that way about my Jan calls haha
FOMO? Ask yourself this instead: if pltr was not mentioned on wsb and it was not mooning would I have bought it? If the answer is no, then because FOMO.
Been hearing that since Friday. Did someone lose the key to the launch switch?
Correct
Ahaha fucking retard
Bought the peak on a Ponzi scheme good job retard
Lets be real. Pre market dont mean shit bro. 

Anything can happen before the opening bell.
Sitting here powerless watching my money fade out of my grasp hurts so bad

where can i buy options on this comment
Everything is at this point.
The weekly gang never learns, otherwise PLTR is right on course
PLTR 50$ by February
I was gonna write calls on homeless people but decided against it
Suburban life lol
must've bought nkla calls
It was probably a guy that joined wsb 12 months ago. You saw 90% of our futures.
He's probably on here trading options
I would also say there is some freedom in that. Not a slave to corperate or society. No debts, no bills, no one else to worry about but yourself. Spending life in nature. Doesn't sound too bad if you ask me.
It fucking better be Im fighting for my life
Me neither Im going to hold and watch my positions decay to zero rather than cutting some losses 
I'll cry with u
Yes
Waiting for it to get under 12$
You have no one to blame but yourself for listening to that hot trash. Same with the ppl pushing cinemark, and nkla or whatever pump n dump will be used to wipe out WSB scrubs.
Unloaded shares today. Was in at 10.25 so I got out at +20%. Still disappointed, thought it would take off
Good entry. News re: merger comes out tomorrow.
Think my 12/31 35C's are going to make it? I feel confident about my 5/21 35C's still.
First one is free
Have you traded before
Didnt you see GME and PLTR
Gratz but not all that glitters tip wise on here lol.
Get out of RKT, too much growth in Market to have cash parked in this piece of shit. Took me 8 weeks to come to terms with that.
Ive made solid gains once I dumped
Today is the day, is gonna moon brother

Trust me
I think 200% is max because that means every share is also borrowed against
can.  Just REALLY expensive to come back from if wrong.
Imagine owning NKLA shares and calling yourself an investor 
Yes
Whats the news?
Yesterday people were afraid of Congress sharpening auditing rules today people have forgotten about that and react to good factory data from Asia.
Fuck china lost so much money. Fuck them
It's a trap
So theta gang can take you tendies.

Beware of the option seller. They want both bears and bulls to lose.
People sold on fear but then realized that the big Chinese companies are going to comply
GME calls
tech calls , but wait after 20 mins to buy bcs the premiums will be crazy at open
BNTX or FROG
SPY puts a hour after open!
Wait is Jagex a public company? Calls on osrs
I already have some but if I hadnt I would probably wait until tomorrow and that Congress vote about auditing.
Doesnt necessarily affect Baba but might change sentiment negatively short term.
Imagine adding drugs to this euphoria
Welp, time to realize those sweet sweet Nikola gains
It's too obvious so will thus stay flat for a few weeks then moon on a random week in January nobody is expecting.
Run off election and a confirmed gop controlled Senate = no major big tax hikes for companies. 5% pop from that result imo
Ive been diamond handing 90% of my portfolio in AMZN calls for a week and Miraculously Im about even still lol. I need that one big day Ive been waiting for
Today might be its day, should do what Apple did yesterday
amzn is up an absolute shit ton this year on the expectation their sales are going to be through the roof.
Theres nothing but positive sentiment. Only way youd profit is by shit luck like the dump yesterday.
Buy puts for 12/25 the week before.
A p x t didnt dump itself
Any news on why its dumping?
i'll remind myself lol see you in 8hrs
Thinking too small my man
Theyve done this the past few months. One of these times its going to be priced in
Calls on QQQ and SPY
That rally was reliant on Bitchcoin breaking 20k - which it did not and is back to 18k

so, no MARA/RIOT parties today
Its true.
Lmao "we may never be able to turn a profit at all with our business model actually. Anyway, the next item on our agenda is the specific amounts of money we lost in the last year."
>we may never be profitable ever

Literally the most bullish statement I ever heard. PURE GROWTH!
Venture capital. Just throw a shit ton of money at the chosen company until its the only one of its competitors left, pull out your money and say good luck.
I'm a fan of the service, but more and more condo associations and apartments are prohibiting airbnb type rentals as part of their legal docs, at least in larger cities. I think that's got to impact the current business, and not sure how they'll evolve past it at the moment
Its what pltr did and what turned me off but look at where they at now
Some brokers wont calculate premarket.
Its literally a big nothing burger can you fucking read? Get the fuck in before you regret it
I wonder if the house rejects the act, China stocks would get a bit
You dont think NIO has a third party auditor?

Weed stocks soaring on news of congressional vote this week to possibly legalize it federally 

APHA seems well-positioned to profit from this news
Strap in, kid
In the same boat brother
I've sold all my weeklies early the past 2 weeks, diamond hands for tendies
Im holding my 12/4 35c cause you never know with the strength on this stock and it would suck if it rockets after we sell.
Dump then roll over to 12/31s
Tell her to play some AAPL calls
Buy apple calls

Why!?
I was promised +10000%! WHERE IS IT???
algos
Waiting on announcement
Its going to trade sideways until the merger. If the news is bad it will dump, if the merger is announced it will fly
Yes
Im in the same fuckin boat bro. Im already down so much I think I end up having less to lose holding longer and hoping for a rocket in a week or so.
its 1/15 so yes
Duh
Yep
yes
Shares or long term calls yes
Wait for $24. Looks like it will happen. $40 by EOY.
Only 60% to go.
fkn hollows out stocks
Lmaooooo was a good run while it lasted
Welcome to the mud, retard. 
Putting your whole account on a meme stock... You definitely belong here. That said 
I bought yesterday at $39.5
*15 EOD
Cheaper at $18
my puts got fucked the first time around, not making that mistake twice
on its way fam
Mate everyone says everything, no one knows shit lmao
To be fair....they did, but they sounded retarded yesterday.
I listened and bought CRSR Friday. Held strong yesterday and loving today.
My average is like $28 but I think i gotta bring that way up soon lol
No shit though
Could be weeks mate dont stress over half an hour or youll give yourself a heart attack
Earnings day is next Tuesday after hours, it *should* still climb some until then, but it's manipulated AF and IV is high.

pls dont
I had pltr 29 calls for friday and i am almost bankrupt after almost making double my portfolio. Does anyone have any thing to say that will make me believe it will go up by EOW :(
What about this one?
How's that Lo Mein taste China man?
Capped out delivery capacity until China helps them expand
Pls go some more
okay Karen
yeah !! where is the manager ? if you don't call him out i will never shop here again    
My calls recovered to +$15 from -hundreds and I sold the fuck out of it.
Just hold its some profit taking after jumping 15%
Profit taking after jumping 13%
Just correcting for a minute. Shhhh. It'll be okay.
Because fuck CRSR. Jumping 9% after that drop yesterday? Trash
THCBii merge is not happening. Possibly an extension to April or all warrants holders r fuk
Honestly though...
People got tired of waiting I guess  itll be funny when they go up 25% in a pre market sesh
Just shaking out the paper hands ez
It's already in the air, I'll wait for the next docking
It doesn't have to reach the strike to make money
This.
Don't tell this guy we made another thread and didn't invite him
Praise the lord for the pltr kids have been banished
Good. I was getting tired of 90% of PLTR comments. I am still invested in it, but I want to talk about the literal thousands of other stocks out there
You sure can
Absolutely, we'd be fucked without it
Yes
Its called a stop loss order or stop market order
You are referring to a stop loss. Where you would sell your position if it falls to a certain price, thus stopping a potential big loss. Limit would mean you only wish to sell if your position reaches higher to a certain price.
It's called a stop loss. Also, don't fucking sell you paper handed towelboy
The smart ones made money and bounced
cant lose what you dont sell
Take the plan hostage and demand ransom. Ez 0 to 1 mil
APX T
Pltr 12/4 $36C
CAAS
we dont but stonks here
no that's boring
Keep averaging in every dip. This is just a healthy pullback.
Buy shares or leaps
Still a few weak handed bitches to shake out.
That's really, really stupid.
I just did. Bought the dip
Ride that 
its the only logical move right now
do not buy puts. we are going to melt higher all of December. 400 is more likely.
Maybe Biden must get Trump back to sign the checks to prevent starvation? Dems might choke on that though.
Bunch of pump and dumpers in this sub set you up
Im thinking gains are coming next week
Bloody red
Half will be wiped out today
March
How heavy are your bags?
PLTR shares remain a great investment. PLTR calls unless leaps are dumb
I doubt EOY, but if you're holding long then you stand to gain. This thing will pop off eventually because of network effect. But I guess WSB only wants +10% daily.
Lol
Have some faith it drops 10 points and recovers 10+ everyday lol
Till lunchtime, I am not gonna have account! But Spy is green
Except CRSR
Yep same
Boomer stock day.
Right there with you.   PLTR 1/15 calls though!
Meme fall down and go boom.
Back up the truck!

As was always going to be the case - wrote as much on here end of last week. People need to treasure the dips this week because when FDA approval arrives + stimmy talks come back online we're rocketing.
Yea a lot of them were real pricks. Downvote bombs if you told them PLTR is done, nasty insults, etc. It was obviously gonna blow
Why is clearing out people a good thing? So MM has more control of the market due to less retail traders?
It goes down until I regret holding it
if it follows most SPA cs it will probably go back down to 12/13 and consolidate before running back up to 17-19,, looka at LC aa

idk just my guess, i sold it at 16.75
This is the bottom... No this is the bottom... Actually wait... This, this is the bo...
Up
This is the way
Sell
Bleeding
Holy shit that's what i'm doing, planning to go for a walk for the first time in weeks
Ok deal  Im getting tired of doing it
This is the way
SAME, its bad like i need to STOP but i cant, its just so easy
same
Lmao
R. Kelly, is that you?
What plays?
What if we already have gains on the shares
explain
Its only Tuesday man youve got time. Just buy a dip at close
Covered calls on PLTR to win that sweet IV?
Im down 5k. Shit sucks
Don't try to claw back, just make decisions your happy with. That's a recipe for disaster
Dude it's trying so hard right now lmao
Its a nice cup and handle forming for sure
I like that
Jesus Christ that's still a $4.5k call
To infinityyyy and beeyooonnndd
Brah, ARK is an incredible fund. They bought PLTR on friday and yesterday. Hold the line and buy more when it's lower. Stay away from the gme and weed stocks
I feel like that all the time. Makes me feel like I control the market
Sell your pltr please
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRXdxiot5JM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRXdxiot5JM)
Fraud allegations
Ahh the ole Kodak strategy
This is the way.
I dont know what you expect when you buy at +55% for the day. Just give ur money to me next time
Yeah buy the dip  we are totally not fucked
and 620 eow
Ya I mean you can take some money out without taking all of it out

But also sold NIO too early shrug
I was just about to say this. All red, but its a green day
It's a long game, but the wait is worth it.
shorts are short since $30 they are winning handily
And they are winning again
Looks like we are both going to be king of the alley.
You still need 24 more shares.
Looking pretty bloody at the moment
Whens EXP?
Smart moneys waiting for the downward pressure to chill, if it drops to the low 20s you'll see huge buys once again
VIX coming down
No, whats it mean
It means its been doing that all day.
VIX is down?
Thats the old strategy
Hope you make tons of friends at the soup kitchen

Short GME!
Its weird when obvious sarcasm gets taken seriously here
Imagine calling options worth 100$ a Portfolio.
joy to my ears
RSI14 on SPY is 50?
by all your positions do you mean pltr
its true
fucking same
And the dog too
Its like CRSR and GME are inversing each other.
saw that, couldn't find any news, whats going on ?
AAPL January calls
Weird day...

Same... Ive been buying & selling spacs for the last week and up 30%. Today wasn't good and sold them all. Is this just a flash in the pan or something deeper?
GME shares for earnings
17.19
20?!?! No way
$15.54
So do you propose banning all IB analysts and their research notes, price targets? People are so sour when the tools they love, like the outrageous Dan Ives and Cathie Wood pumps on certain stocks, work against them.
Tesla has moved $10 since I bought in last week and Ive still lost 60% on my TSLA 750c WHAT IS HAPPENING
10$ EOD is looking pretty good
150%
yep.  and made a lot of money for people on the other side.

I FOMOd, up $1k already. Hope it keeps ripping
Cant stop.
that would be nice since i bought a 3300 call last week and it i sdown
Exactly what happened, I was up 48% posted it in here, now up 8% after it walked off a cliff 
the tropiest of wsb tropes
I feel better now about losing 3k. Still it sucks man.
LOL good for you and the PLTR retards in here
I'm fairly certain that by playing this today, we're setting ourselves up for the next month. I will not be paper-handing these.
BB gets the codename BigBoss
Oh the stock is fine, just the weekly call yoloers are fucked
15%? LMAO down 60%. All in like a retard on fking PLTR
Lmao that spike was me !!
Lol nice I only had $100 to put on it
Proof?
Yes.
Ask for refund, me no like this game!
Waiting for tendies 

BB TO THE MOON

Buy TSLA puts... all of them.
What are your next plays?
Tsla will cross 600 by eow
Youre only about a week and a half late..
Most SPACs are down today calm the fuck down
The floor is 10$ bro 
They said its very long term on here so buckle up if you are in it
Just hold
Are you kidding
AAPL is up 3+% today?
It literally seems like ALL meme stocks are selling off today while majority of the market is green.
Really? Wow
$park $plug my dood
u bought t 129 didn u hahahahhaha
I can see it going back to 23. MM and Institutions are seeing how many days in a row they can give the PLTR gang a haircut. Getting Scalped 3 days straight.
Maybe January
By EoW
Dont marry it. I m also learning hard way. And repeating my mistake.
The real idiots are those that sold PLTR for GME.
genuine question, is nio actually a tesla or nikola comparison?
Im from the future. Yes.

  


    

Thank you!!
Awesome DD OP
I think Im gonna get some calls, you anticipate they continue to run?

Motley Fool has been a shitshow all year

Tbf every other stock forum on the internet is way worse than wsb at doing this

right here. 50% of my portfolio in at 33 :)
> shilling PLTR and GME  
>  
>Go all in on worthless meme stocks

wow im offended , PLTR is not a worthless brick & mortar like GME
Repeat
Just go thetagang after you lose. Its like rehab then you relapse back into wsb.
The amount of retards who think they have front row seats to an "infinity squeeze" of their lifetimes is downright hilarious
Im 10% down 
LOL
Why sell already?? Like shares or a contract?
Im still holding Kodak, thankfully only 80 dollar loss and Ill just keep them as a reminder of what NOT to do again.
Stocks don't always go up retard. Up two, three steps, down one, two steps.
Pussy
Most of us tards got in sub $20. So we still made money. Your fault for waiting too long to pull the trigger
Same but at 29 and worried
will sell below $15 RIP
11, still pissed about my 12/31 calls though
entered at 19, getting a little worried.
I have a tendie boner thinking about all the calls I bought yesterday.

What a revelation.

Mod this guy

Retarded if you buy FDs period for most part.  Some of the stock/etf recommendations on here aren't that bad but yeah have to filter through a ton of shit meme stonks.
If you know its coming soon just short the market
then post your short positions you 
Let me tell you a secret. All of these factors have been up since last crisis. Let that sink in.
In the meantime, buy buy buy
Then sit on the sidelines while we ride the wave. Better yet load up on puts and always be a day late and a dollar short.
Gonna last a year or so more at least.
So short the VIX?
But not today! All in!

Killed bin laden,
I can tell you if you want to know [srs?] I've read much of their S1
Data analysis to execute targeted assassinations
My take:

&#x200B;

They leverage advanced data-fusion techniques that apply AI/ML across multiple forms of digital and multi sensor-sourced data for plug and play use in existing C4ISR infrastructure. They apply human intelligence on top of this to fine-tune the capabilities and focus to derive prescient actionable intelligence insights that would otherwise be impossible to garner with even 10x the applied human effort. This allows them to support the warfighter and increase battlespace awareness, improve the analysis and dissemination of critical intelligence, and expanded baseline intelligence insights to form initial strategies. 

&#x200B;

Similarly, they have pivoted to expand these offerings to include commercial applications of the same technology, previously limited to the DoD and IC. In its commercial form, palantir can be used to improve industrial MRO, provide market insights to financial customers, be leveraged to analyze medical data and clinic trial data in pursuit of pharmaceutical breakthroughs, provide insights into social media manipulation, fight terror recruiting on media platforms, improve logistics and operational capabilities, and so much more.

&#x200B;

The name is derived from some geeky seeing stones in the lord of the rings that give a wizard all-seeing capabilities. In reality, Palantir takes the best and brightest minds and expands their analytical capabilities and insights by allowing them to leverage next-generation data analytics technology, today.
theyre a multi level(cloud, software, secret algorithms, AI learning) software systems company that has everything integrated into one single platform that is "easy to use" and access for all levels of government. it basically makes the user smarter who is using it and helps them with whatever task they need help with as it. take immigration in the UK for example. they use PLTR software now to run the visas through and check if theres anything that the person is flagged for. the PLTR system is so well connected it can find more things that the system they are using now and get more bad guys. it doesnt just check a few standard databases like the old software before PLTR, now it has the capability to check a lot more government computers, because they are all linked together with this software system Palantir has created. as well as scanning visas, PLTR software also keeps a record and learns from logging all goods going in and out of the country.  add this connectivity to a system that actively learns with algorithms/AI, getting better everyday, and its a slam dunk. basically governments are updating their operating systems from windows 95 to Palantir.

Youre an idiot.
Hold a bit longer. I think they will both moon some time between tomorrow and Friday
How much have you lost
gonna ride out to next year no worries
Good luck
I went from 25k to 15k to 6k in two days. I have no idea How can i be so retarded to not take some gains and some losses and instead have decided to opt out for all losses. I'm astonished at my own autism.
WTF job is that? Thats like slave wages
Puts on your life expectancy.
N...No?
It's better than looking at stocks 12 hours a day and losing $1300 a month
Thats not even worth it for $1300 a week.
You live in africa?
not at all. i work maybe a total of 5 hours a day for $4.5k a month take home lmao
like 18 hours a day five days a week or one 18 hour day for $1,300/mo?  One is yes one is no.
massive squeeze
I havent seen this many bag holders created since Genius Brands last summer.
The music stopped and your still dancing
Bruh we all left
RETAIL OWNS LIKE 5% OF THE STOCK YOU FUCKING RETARD. Like the 10th time i see this EVERY DAY. Fucking idiots.
lol! PLTR is done, son. Going back to 22 for a few months.... jump on something else like BABA next week after the sell off from wed House vote.
Bee-Bois bout to bring the honey home.
Don't play in Australia, it's trash. I sit up until at least 2am every night so I can play in the US. That's how bad it is.
Best decision I made. Took what gains I had on the 3500$ or so I had in  put it all on SPY 12/2 weekly calls on the dip yesterday. Hoping for a good return this morning then buy back into it if it drops back down to the 11$ area.
Only time will tell. NKLA is a retarded stock
I think your right. It will hit 3 definitely not today but soon. It is a giant piece of shit.
That's just Irwin Simon sneaking up on you.

Nobody fucking knows.
Noob here, TSLA has a P/E ratio of over 1,100. From what little I know that seems a *tad* high, implying it's overvalued. What should one make of this? 

edit: wow, downvotes for asking a question to understand better  I'm not saying Tesla is overvalued.
Baiting everyone in a stock that is obviously a scam, and selling first chance is kind of bad though.
Dxy. They are killing dollar to fuel the pump. By buying euro and yen.
It's 

We've learned that if you put  with your trade that they go up. Try it.
Isnt Powell meeting today to discuss stimulus? You think another package is coming?
Are you? Im thinking as well

Can anyone really go a month with out sex or jacking off?
Because it's so predictable that they could rug pull the shit out of us if they really wanted to manipulate the market.
Trapped in tendie town is where I want to be.
They deserve it. 5 years ago, BB was higher than it was at 3:59 yesterday. It's a total shit fest, with NKLA esque fan boys. Who actually had some great news.
You got that half right.

I sold mine Friday  for a big loss
Its weirdly peaceful watching all this whilst only owning shares isnt it

Lol. Truth.
F same
Same buddy. You cant win them all, and nobody knows what the future holds anyway. It might have dropped even further today 
It will go up at 9am
Ive been buying this drop since last week.  Been waiting for a day like this.
At new ath? This is when you buy them.
been a gay bear, never going back. Puts are so much riskier. Theres a limited potential. Unless a company goes bankrupt its hard to make huge sums. But a call has exponential upside. Learned the hardway
Dont tell them pls
Printing press
Receipts
Tis but a scratch
Money can come just as easy as it goes
Maybe adjust your meds

Yup
You still can, its called a put
Forreal holy shit. Earnings gonna be massive
Got in at $24. Sold at $47. Got in at $40 yesterday

Pump and dump, doesnt take a genius to figure that out
IV still really high

Im the dumbass who bought at 17
Color blind options might legit do that.. I need to try something
SPY puts
If you go to their subreddit its literally a cult lol
Everyones freaking out but imo this companies out look for the future is extremely bright. It def got ahead of itself but I do see 300$ in 2 years.
i watch it go up and up everyday and the day i buy it....... plummet immediately
I sure hope so. My calls are down 50% from when I bought yesterday lol

Im buying tsla dip but averaging thru day. It can always go lower. Progressive buying. Start small then add more if it falls further.
Im down 15k since Friday.
No. Close your brokerage for an HR, then check
if you bought weeklies, yeah. Anything beyond next week, you're fine.
18.70...
Dont worry, here is 18.60 a share

Which do you think is the best play?
Pls sell
hes talking now
Don't want to throw a dead deer in the back of a model 3
Me too ...even tho I ma in deep shit
i hope to god they dont get delisted
Lmao that means that they offered someone else the role and that person turned it down. Now the question should be - why did the other person turn the job down? And how is this company going to fuck me?
So does that mean you can only buy options 30+ days out? Good luck at the job!
$10 decline still to go:)
Lol I have 12/18 600c an 640c not worried but deff hurts to see

what if its not just 1 dudes opinion. Could it be that stocks that go up massive amounts in a short period have to correct?
dude most of all the meme stocks are tanking today. this isn't just Citron lmao
I got in yesterday at open. Im getting railed over here.
Gg for you
calls?
We are all retards on this blessed day
Fr
How far out?
yeah, considering shorts doubled down yesterday and there's a lot less buying today, it was always gonna be a rough one, plus, the meme sector is screwed.
survive? What do you mean? Hard bleed for me.. I'm one of the clown bought at peaks :/
Hold 12.11? Im a noob asshole throwing money around - please help

You fucked your self over getting into a meme stonk 
Buying opportunity
Happy to help! Tomorrow is gonna be a *good fucking day*
Well at the pace Im going Im not gonna have a job at this rate because I cant keep my eyes off robinhood

The correct term is a less smart ENRON
in on NKLA puts lol @ those clowns
basically, such a tease

Bottom line its always going to be the big guys that save our portfolios. You want it to be the little guy but never is.
You should have taken gains bud
That's what I'm sayin!!!

It's gonna run hard
I'm adding to my calls today for sure!  We are down 26% in 3 days.  Trend is still bullish.
Rich people are stable enough to not need daily news
The problem is that only meme stocks are down. Which means they may very well keep dropping
Gme is outdated dying company
It shouldn't be a few minutes, as absurdly shorted as it is, if it happens, I'd say absolute bare minimum 30 minutes, but it could easily be hours or even a few sessions, depending on how the shorts move in the next few days.
short squeeze my balls
there is not going to be a short squeeze and if it does you will see +150% in a day but it wont happen.
I'm already on margin like a true dumbass
Same! Saw this play around 9:30. Biggest gain of my portfolio today options/stock
This is the way

Did the moon fall into a giant pile of shit down here on Earth?  Because that's where my APHA is since I bought it this morning on what I thought was a dip.
&#x200B;

Other brokerages wouldnt crash unexpectedly on big volume days
Fidelity is solid
Send me 2k pussy
if you don't transfer to another brokerage at least enable multi-factor authentication. robinhood doesn't have the best security.
For one another broker will actually have customer service
Better interfaces/graphs and automation. Better support if something goes wrong. But if youre just buying leaps and chilling then robinhood is simple
Better fills. The UI on other apps may seem intimidating, but its worth it.
This fucker is like a cockroach lol, its resilient as hell. Trevor should start his own religion at this point for all the retards that think this company is going anywhere
NIO day?
Im retarded. Should I buy Puts or calls?

Dude it's going to 10x into PLTR market cap territory. This thing is ripe.
I had some briefly and ditched em intraday. IV was well over 200%, just not much upside barring a full on tank to like $5 in short order
Strike? I bought x4 21P at $2.43 yesterday and sold first thing this morning for a quick 85% profit.
Youve got time
You've seen how wild 2 days can be.  You got 45 days on your side. Plus sitting through the wrath is good for patience in the long term.
I was just thinking this about my GME 21c 01/15.  I concluded hold. Its tempting though..
I learned you go down with the ship or miss out on a come back
Amazon had phones which no one wanted. Another one??

Told me I was a genius, but it felt extremely sarcastic.
The second step is AAPL weekly calls and shares
The second step is saying fuck it and going all in.
Gonna print.
Honestly that POS stock fucking rockets on the smallest news. Buy calls, bottom is in.
No, he has to learn.
How in the holy fuck do they figure the price is low!? Its a $7 BILLION company with no sales, no earnings, no product, no business plan, and the founder is going to jail! Jesus Christ people. Someone please tell me how the price is low.

Sorry maam but I believe the retardation is irreversible
Thats a tough one
Psst. Insider tip. The government has pumped trillions into the market and will pump trillions more. Trillions in scared money on the sideline in addition and the pandemic is almost over. I think stonks go up now.
You might as well keep going til you run out of money.
Dont throw in the towel. Once you do market will dump. I wanna keep this thing pumping. Thank you for your sacrifice
the market is sooo strong right now.  BTFD.
you're talking to yourself?

No one said it was organic growth. We said it was meme power. The crash was market manipulation though.
andy left is gonna get suicided isnt he
Hard when you have all 0DTE and weeklies
Never let this sub trick you lol
this is a meme sub. what do you expect from 18 year olds spamming emojis.
WSB is not nearly big enough to decide whether the squeeze happens or not
So true. Thats why people on this sub love options, everything is get rich quick instead of long term strategy
The squeeze has nothing to do with WSB, contrary to what most of the posts here want to make you believe. It's all on Cohen and it's a waiting game. There are folks here who have been long on GME for 3 years. WSB buying shares ain't doing shit except making us rich when the squeeze happens and providing some hype volume. This has to be treated as a long play.

Same thing happened in October. There was a bunch of hype here around GME, people bought in and the stock went up to like 13ish over a couple days then faded back to 10-11 over the next month. Then the hype built back up here on a big green day last week and everybody started talking about the squeeze again, and now it's going to fade back down to like 15. Were just going to continue this cycle until Cohen blesses us with unlimited tendies.

PXT checking in. Getting blasted

Well when everyone bought weekly calls at 34, a 2% drop in PM is a crisis.
Was up 4% at some point, so thats a -50% crash in their minds.
I cant read
Because it will go sideways and everyone will lose.
2% is nothing
Because half the PM gains are already gone
99% of the sub has weeklies that were bought at the MF top.
Man 90% of this sub needs to make money TODAY. Shits a year play
Its dead bro
You asked about buying GME yesterday why dont you just sit down
Also QQQ, SPY, IWM all gapped up and have gone up today. Only thing getting killed are memes up 50% in the last month

Honestly its on my watchlist and Im just going to wait until a month before next earnings to get in.

Thing doesnt seem to want to move without a catalyst and people always hype it up before earnings
Same with SONO
Of course this was the week I decided the sell calls....
Aligned with banks. Kids finally learned
Yeah, pot stocks for the most part have been hot garbage. If your willing to take the risk go for it!
Kinda. But if it does pass it my pump more. I bought a few calls last week and will be selling half today or tomorrow before the news. And bag holding the other half just in case
APHA makes real profit internationally. Can't go wrong with them.
Only your settled balance. So if you have 10k and do 10k of buy and sell you're done.
Ya but you can trade options with a cash account.
Yeah the difference is that it takes longer for transactions to settle.

It will correct after the inclusion date. Use that information accordingly (or not)
What day does it get included?
It could fluctuate a bit but whether or not it crashes would depend on if they can live up to what Elon has claimed that Tesla could potentially become: battery developer, Uber-like service, self driving vehicles, etc.
It will still run up with these tards
Holy fuck. They must be really banking that we all about to flock to other ppls houses the second we can
At what valuation!?
Share price is irrelevant. Whats the market cap?
Hopefully it opens around that range to retail. I'll get 200 shares off the bat

I am selling at open. Fuck this overnight pump
stock has dummy strength I'm telling u, some people buying the dip. Tbh this might not tank till February and then they might randomly get some news its dumb
Maintain the expansion I miss the classic quotes pre COVID
Fed's large "tools" are the new economy. We might be living in a world without jobs pretty soon...
Not too late - should run into EOY at minimum
Expected it to be 600 by now, just waiting til open I guess
Huge spike right after announcement yesterday then stalled out at 593ish. Keeps catching a bid when it drops around those levels. Im assuming hedge funds are waiting for market to open for liquidity to purchase more shares rather than buying now which would push the price up.
Source?
It wont drop below 16,000 again. Get in soon or fomo
It does this because it's even more algo run than the stock market, lots of profit taking and spooking out weak hands.

Of course I could be wrong, but I've done well with it
Rip to me I sold my $6.5c at a loss yesterday

I've found that with espresso machines you get what you pay for.  If it's not 500+, it's not good. I heard the breville barista is the pretty much the top buy under a grand.    It's the next luxury item I'm going to purchase for myself.

Definitely worth the money. Can't drink plain coffee anymore
I have it and use it everyday, AMA
Yes I have and its great. I got the one with the screen and its the best purchase Ive made this year.
This is the way
Down on premarket but very low volume. Id assume bullish option flow coming at open though. Im staying in
Id keep it. Upgrades coming soon.
that is pink... and blue... respectively
Yes, that's why you should buy their parent company tesla, which is owned by SPCE
No different Chinese evs
Very often they have the same daily chart. LI as well
if Google stock hits $2,000 by December 25th, I'll be very happy.

GERMANY, MAY 12th 2017
It will, they are running out of bullshit to sling at it.
Long OTM calls when I starts to trend up will be a tendie ticket
About to be a 4.5+ a in few minutes
I hope we have a mini-rally back to 460 so I can exit my calls
amd or tsla
Tesbruh
Apha fubo tril pltr your mom
PT
BB calls
Both
AMD IV high after yesterday's move, but probably still lower than PLTR.
we rally today boy,stay on the rocket if you like money
Hold to 700+
New ATHs coMing between now and the 21st. Hopefully today we see 610
Yes, buy at the top
Deal with amazon
Amazon deal
and Yearly?
is it 2008 again people be going back to blackberry? Remember research in motion?(the company that produced blackberry smartphones). There was a time from 2006-07 when RIMM was the biggest stock of the town
May the force be with you
Sell now. Rebuy at $580
Might as well wipe your ass since you got paper hands
Pussy
This better be a joke
If you want to loose money then yes buy nkla
1/15 30c dead?
More like 26.xx 
Yeah cause you probably have way out of the money calls that expire this week
Getting destroyed every day at open
35 is probably too high. I think well see a jump back up but am considering same decision with 30c 12/4. Will be watching today for an afternoon spike and exit opportunities.
Worthless. Then you can retard like the rest of us.
shoulda sold at open
lmk ill sell if u sell 
i feel like there's no way it will be down 2 weeks in a row
This always happens in the morning, give it a little while.
ye wtf, i saw my port is down .27 and spy is up 1%... This has never happened, i guess my portfolio got too memey?
LOL
No, but am I the mattress?
Its gonna kill premium
nothing interesting till next week
Yep me too
You're just impatient, go ahead and sell. I'll make sure to come back and mock you when it moons again
Tell that to PSTH, I've been waiting for it to dip to buy more for a bit now
Sauron
Taking it's time
Those are my thoughts. Big boys don't buy at ATH. I hope it doesn't tank to 500 level before mid-December.
I think this is why it can't hold 600, I had the same thought as you. If it makes 600 again I'm gonna close calls and wait until the day before the inclusion to go back in and hope it moons. Unfortunately my broker only allows monthly options with set expiries
Probably me
Exercising for shares. Options definitely not the play rn but still one of the most undervalued stocks in the market
That would be me. At -85% already.
Might regret that one
I yolo'ed on Calls when it was $30. What should I do??
It's done. It's up 150% this month. Let people take profits.
my man
Yeah,  is almost half way to their short PT already, sad thought  had more s than this.
I will double down if it does

It's not the same.
Certainly been there.  Still room to run though.
News that they discovered a cure for cancer? What kind of news doubles a companys market cap overnight?
No you missed the dip already dont fomo at/near the possible top
Always buy TSLA calls
Wait til 10:30 and see which direction its going then decide. Thats usually when youll know if its a good idea or not.
GME gang will have plenty of tendies to donate after the squeeze, too.

pandemics are good for financial markets
Shhhh let it climb
Saw this on unusual whales and your comment sold me. Let's see if I lose more money
That's an insider trading level of money
Yeah but we can get rich on inclusion day
In a good or bad way?
When you say that, I can't tell if it's a good thing or a bad thing.
bingo buddy, red dildo incoming, better wait for a dip
Eh why not

&#x200B;

I'm in 700c 12/11 b/c I'm a little low on funds right now lol. Trying to swing it.
Right - everyone is expecting it up more, and I think it will be even sooner if everyone would stop panic selling.
Whens exp
The mods are trying to keep the gains for themselves
Low market cap iirc.
The company founded last year with two employees and a CEO named Jeffery Epstein? 

I dont know man. Sounds legit to me.
TSLA is the only company that can continuously get great news and shit the bed
It was a temp boost, BB has no business model. I had shares in it long ago. Calls are retarded but us with shares is good.
40 sh*res bought in the summer just so I could say I owned some value
Sell off PLTR and buy DKNG sounds oh so good right now
Seems like a dip in an uptrend for them
yup...
Ayeeee up a g today after being down a g yesterday
God I hope that can happen, they can't even fucking pass a simple stimulus helping the economy
Theyve got 3 years to comply. Still not good but weve got time.
Nah I feel hope on the horizon.

Nothing. Its ok. Probably 122 eod.
Lmao said every news headline for the past 2 months
Hope ur right lol
Fuck it. It's my last hope
together we ride my brother
Why would you wanna sell?  CRSR is big 
Just did!
Thats good for people with cash
My ekg probably inversing NIO price action
Fortunately Im buying puts AND calls and staying green
its their timer
Gov of AZ
Im buying a fuck ton more if it hits $20. Just being patient
For making money? Lol
You couldve bought ARKG on the dip and been up 6%. But yeah, most all meme shit got fucked
Everything is dying. CRSR still green 
Seems like a good dip. Wish I had waited longer for the bottom.

Fuck Robinhood and their 25k limit requirement
Just sell if youre that concerned. Its for the best. Hate the PDT rule

Yea, my puts got fucked too. No more weeklies for me over 100% IV
We hold
Same baby. Hold
The when you check your heart drops as you realize you could have sold for a 20% loss instead of being 70% down
You'll be back next week G
F'ing ridiculous. The people that actually need the stim are not representative of the market. How are they that out of touch? The candle shop shutting down is not representative of the market. The out of work lower middle class people (mostly) are not investing.
No Im not holding LI Auto (Chinese EV)
Thinking of buying after that goldman sachs PT update
I am and Im down 20
Hope u had puts
Whats the price?
It is. Itll drop down quick IMO, thats when you should consider buying.
Is he still talking?
Thats what they said yesterday 
i bought too early, 48.50, but it will be green sometime next week
Might want to wait on that...
It is a patient play. Sit tight for now.
its not delisting Chineese stocks. Its delisting the one that dont comply with an audit within a 3 year period. I think the bill will pass The House of Rep simply because Anti-china sentiment is very popular for dems and reps. But I also think that people are blowing this way out of proportion.
I bought in yesterday
Thats one way of looking at it, Id say its a big opportunity for entrepreneurs to make money. Nobody is forcing you to waste money you dont have.
It just needs to chill at 30 for the rest of the year
If it goes to 45 Im selling.
Yep burn $
same
Please tell me those are shares. Also, hope youre kidding about ROPE, because its just money, man
Imagine roping over a 4 figure loss
I just need to sell my shares and it will go to 25 guaranteed.
holding
Holding... shares don't expire and PLTR has a lot higher to go.
Hold and forget at this point
Im afraid to sell, as they usually go up right after  lmao
What profits?!
Im holding through the end of the year
holding
The latter will happen. Foia is broad and there isn't a reason to find out who got the $$$
Ridiculous. Not enough biz qualified for the fed programs. He wants Congress to move that money to PPP, which is saving businesses. pretty simple
Doesn't matter, we the People's Republic now, just print more money
who cares? just keep writing checks.

Meme, SPAC, EV minus TSLA, ZM are getting gaped today.
AMZN too.
Smoke that dank
600 eod
Tesla along with many others are down due to zoom bust.
Should have been more patient and bought the actual dip and not the fake one first thing.
Been on since battery day
Strike and date?
wrong
Yes, you should sell if you think they still sell phones.
They make car infotainment systems now
Up bigly.
Regret selling mine a few weeks ago.
Sold off one of my Dec 13 as a 10 bagger this morning
Love to see it
wrong dip
here
Yeah I looked at that DD 4 days ago and almost bought 10 contracts. Would be up like 4000% if I did
2022 $15 calls up 80%
Amazon collab.
They just made a deal with Amazon
gives no fucks.
I did that last week then immediately rolled the profits into a losing position
Faster than that. Its boosting right now. Already hit $9.
This week
lol damn. whats your entry?
Because most stocks are in fact not bleeding lol
Only retarded meme stocks that we all are getting fucked by
You just linked the Charles Schwab log in portal bruh
Eat a good meal
Just know that its coming back. Just so you dont have a weekly.
Literally everything shilled on this thread. Surprise.
Holding requires patience young autist padawan
Schrdingers portfolio. SchrdingerBets
12/4 8$ puts for the win
ppl went into PLTR when it was up 300% over a week, they prob think 50% is a deal!

Jesus X is up 10%
And we all know, none of us are actually green on BABA.
Its green but my positions are still almost break even from yesterday
Read the large DD post from yesterday. This is a medium term play not a weekly play. If it doesnt happen after Q4 earnings in March then the bulls were wrong but until then you may as well hold
The fact that GME recovered and is holding these levels is impressive. Dont worry, earnings still 7 days away and lots of buzz surrounding it. I bought the dip.
Best of luck
I dont trust anyone here to operate an aircraft, and for this reason I am liquidating my entire GME position
I think Nikola has frightened many SPAC holders. I expect Wednesday onward to be better (gentle raised) for the bee
Exactly! The stock is still cheap and hasnt run up much
Vote is Friday so its scaring off the paper hands. Fuck em.
buy buy buy
News on Dec 3. Just wait.
Hmm maybe investing in a company that doesnt actually do anything because some dude told u they were gonna buy a battery company was a bad idea
No one wants to answer

Who was the guy who did the dd
Get out while you can lol
my dying spy puts would indicate that's a lie
This is what keeps us degenerates coming back

Approve baba for what? Sounds like I might have some hope.
That is also the way

Yah only rich and well connected people should make money in stocks. Who cares as long as we make money and arent left holding the bag.
I've had to avoid looking at the main WSB page to not do anything stupid, its so difficult to stay level headed and not feel like I'm missing out on the next greatest stock every damn day.
GME fuckin mooning, people bought the morning dip
Always set stop losses.
Youre welcome
Im holding shares in my IRA because the company looks promising. Got in at $16 tho
Vix is red right now slightly
What are you thinking?
So tempted for a gamble play
My weekly CSPs like them. Ill take that 200%+ IV to the bank. Hopefully Cramer or Motley pumps it more for us.
Now? Lol it went up 45% overnight dawg
Don't buy 200% IV puts.

Sell naked calls instead if you're bearish. Low capital required.
No idea. But I'm not touching anything that's up 50% by open regardless. Not even puts, this meme shit never dies fast enough to beat iv or theta
Zoom out farther bro. Was at $30+ years ago
That happened to me today as well i am not sure what to do?
Needs to break 590. Im bag holding 12/11 620c. I didnt buy at open but I also didnt buy at the low either. Slowly breading out.
DXY is gonna drop another 10% in the next year.
Last time circuit breakers happened VIX was at like +80 man. We thought COVID might literally be Spanish Flu 2.0
why would that happen ?
They are shipping it out so doubtful
But MRNA
>ited to join the ranks of weed stock bagholders!

They keep alternating. Legit if you go back to last week, people were screaming at apple because it had been flat for a month and last week had a couple small red days. Now aaple is doing real good this week. Thats why you don't sell those giants when they are flat. Msft might get a bull spike anyday now. I like QQQ for that reason. no Fomo. you get all the tech giants
Dont need to average down when you bought in at 10 *taps head*
What did they say

What makes u think earnings wont be negative?
Already sold some CSPs. Im not getting burned again by a stock that rocketed already.
This shit will be $15 by tomorrow
TSM is nice. my gf owns it. wish I got in on it.
Shhhh BBY
Always
Halal what?
I sold when it hit 119 yesterday. 
u right
Icln did me well last week. Now I need it to pull me out of this hole I got myself in 
Throw ARKG in there as well
IPO been doing me a solid for a couple months also. I've got all the ARK funds and ICLN heh.
Lets goooooooooooooo
The shitty thing is, he's right on this one.

I hate even typing this shit
What calls?
What is the news?
I took a $600 loss, could be worse I guess
I like it.
Yea lemme buy in after it runs 300%
wth is this ears thing
you might consider a strategy with a closer put and long dated call or sell a put if you're risky
If you have more than a one-day timeframe, yes.
yes
Acb
its never too late
Please be true. IV crush is eating me alive
I'm actually amazed its still at $17 lol
Literally. From a mile away. There was a big ass fucking sign.
Lol I just bought 4 calls for the week expecting some retarded ass bounce off this 17. Stupid gamble I know but I've seen happen with NKLA multiple times
r/Nikolacorporation is to Trevor Milton as Scientology is to Tom Cruise
Because Im holding puts... thats why.
That guy is so fucking ridiculous
first time seeing this 
this guy is WSB mascot
personification of the sub
Jeez do you sell naked outs or are you covering them with 300k cash
buy CRSR and sell weekly covered call. Ez
Same. Looks like buying most anything that took the morning hit yesterday paid off today
always chasing dat money
no
Hold that shit
This is the dip bby, im buying. See yall on the moon.... or in the guter
Yeah, it'll surly go up after the vote fails in the senate.
I think 100% EOW is likely.

When tech is green and something like MSFT is red, buy calls then watch that ticker join the rest of its brothers green
Buy dips, hold, profit.
1) wait for wsb to pump whatever shit stock they think theyre pumping

2) wait for the inevitable crash (ex. CRSR)

3) buy leaps

I guess youd have to be able to afford LEAPs to begin with.
Should've held man. Stocks only go up
Msft sucking again tho
Basically the Palantir of EV and more.
I'm still buying tho.
Idk. It bumped up over $2 in the last few days, it makes sense that investors will dump some to get that profit. I think it will pass the house and you will see another rally. However, if the Georgia run off goes republican, I bet everyone will dump again because legalization will never happen under a republican controlled senate.
Lol
Sell
I know but Im not telling you
Because it's low volume low market cap and they don't want pump and dumps. I think it's prob a legit trade but thems the rules.
No options
they banned all the SPACs
I'm going to buy more.

15000 @ 13.10 at the moment

Another 15000 at 11.90 and I'm averaging 12.50!!

Boom
Cause they are pumping up the jam and then will be dumping.
Look at apples run in august and September lol anything is possible
I hope not lol
My spacs and memes are spactacular
Theyve been converted to blackberry chads
Same
Are you circumcised
We love our homies with extra chromies
Going further, people are just realizing that BigBoss isn't a plain phone company anymore.

BB is basically the Palantir of EV, to put it bluntly.
nice
nice
Will you be selling puts with extra cash or just keep it as shares and wait?
Why not EOD?
Shhhh
Dont look at the screen please
no point i always get burned buying them
I dunno man, I have been buying some puts here and there to hedge but I keep buying calls too, I got a feeling this pump has another day at least.
ur gonna regret that
The same people who think Trevor Milton is an upstanding man that was unfairly forced to step down
Y u lion
Finally
yes but rn kinda oversold
Nobody tell him
100% EVERY FKING TIME
Thanks for your contribution
Ill be worth a million bucks if it does lmao 
For what reason
I got mid - late December
There was IV crush. That SP500 meeting somehow became a catalyst
Welcome to the club...my appl 120c expired 11-27 now the bastard is currently @ 122.92

Damn that tesla put is gold. Im a 40 IQ mouth-breather for buying calls that expire worthless every time.
What is the call
Holding a dead stock is like holding a dead fish you better get rid of it fast, cause its only going to get stinkier
Yah we know homie.
They're already turning profits internationally.
So baghold till then?
Yeah, i am fine with just taking gains on my calls and buying them back/rolling out on the dips. Right now that is an ATM.
It had like 4 days and I lost a couple of hundreds. Took out a good chunk of my shares and not adding anymore. Im just riding for king term now
These asshole boomers can't wait to get back into the office so that they feel special again. The trash generation
It's getting ready to take off.  Running out of people to take profits from 25-30.

The moons only up for half the planet.

ONE OF US ONE OF US
you are a true ~~autist~~ artist
Yolo it in GME  or your a pussy
Look for a pullback on RIOT if bitchcoin keeps dumping and then go all in on some 8 or 9$ calls. I put in 4k on Fridays pullback and cashed out half my contracts yesterday for 100+% gains and letting the others ride as they don't expire until 1/15/21 and I predict bitchoin is about to blow the top off ATHs the way it keeps flirting with 20k. 20k keeps rejecting the bitchcoin Dick but sooner or later she's going to take it
Wait for any number of the IPOs coming this month
SLV and GLD itm leaps
Fizz and play 12/18 calls about 15 to 30% otm are lookimg nice. Both high short interest both have vaccince catalyst, both running bullflags on a 1 month 1 hr chart. The rest is up to u. I have snol pp positions on both prob will add today. If jmia has a red day today puts into the 20s are prob printing nect couple weeks. Aapl seems like it will be unstoppable this holiday szn. Goodluck homie
Leaps on NIO
Baba calls
MAC
Longer dated contracts on airlines, JETS or LUV 

If you want to do covered calls, RKT is decent with growing financials
AAPL and AAL leaps, buy some UVXY calls to hedge.

If you dont want to hedge, AAPL, MSFT, and AAL leaps.
What are the chances thatis just fomo and it will crash after the vote?

Im scared now that wsb is on this  train.

No, all shares and 2022 calls
It's been...2 days...
Guess that's the signal to buy in. Thanks!
As is tradition
Oh now you want to listen lol bro stop letting the shills hype you up with PTLR, you were probably in the green a week or so ago thats when you should have sold. Ppl hyping it and downvoting others warning you to get out are the ones bag holding hoping to get out as soon as they can.

Depends what you mean by rally. All stocks go up but the retard gains are probably gone
puts are only adding fuel to the rally fire
Next week
It will rally back on vaccine distribution news next week
I bought for longer term gains. Its a legitimately powerful company.
Long term not fucked, weekly option holders r fuk. I would know since I'm one of them fucking HELL
You just bought the top, congrats and welcome.

That sounds like money apple found on the ground and gave it to a kid that was staring at him
LOL i think you misread that...

No one chose AAPL over MSFT.

"No major cloud provider to date has brought about a means to rent a remote computing infrastructure with MacOS from their clouds."

Sounds to me like everyone chose MSFT over AAPL and now Amazon is like "wait well we can probably afford to do that too now"
Did you even read it?
So you are saying that my QQQ puts have a chance
I get where u coming from but vaccine optimism too high man
Aint nothing wrong with wealth transfers - its just like sector rotation
There are two diametrically opposed perspectives guiding the American political response to the pandemic: 

1.	shut things down to reduce the spread and provide stimulus to people and businesses so they survive 
2.	dont shut anything down, every man for himself, no stimulus needed 

Both sides think the other side is evil incarnate, and we end up with an emergent solution that makes no sense and fucks a large portion of people over. But still - the constituents of both parties blame the other party for everything going wrong. Whats the catalyst for soul searching when every constituent thinks the politicians they support are trying to do the right thing, and its just the other party fucking everything up?
I think it might be over for pltr

one thing i've managed to learn all these years is to leave your money in the good companies and use your fuck around money to gamble. trying to move shit around has always fucked me.
in a market de-risking, overbought equities will be the first to dump. IPOs, memes, etc.
NIO will be back on end of week just chil everyone paper handed because they dont know how to read a damn bill
SAME!
Oh it will friend. It will [https://www.tradingview.com/x/hMvDorXf/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hMvDorXf/)
Give it time
Imagine buying calls on a shitty company for short squeeze lol
This could happen anytime between now and June or never so hang tight bud
I have a bridge to sell you too
   
Did the % of float shorted go down? That should tell you
Wow very intellectual thought. Let me check something. Oh wait, Short Interest is still at an ATH. Guess you're wrong!
Short interest is hasn't moved, so no. It has yet to happen
Just give up on it
Itll drop here I think. Ill buy back in once it does
I got banned for this lol
I'll sell you guys your fd's!
You mean pile in more, right?
So we hitting 19 today right.. .right...
If you own shares you shares nothing to worry about. If you have calls, then yeah you better hope they're not weeklies
Bro you only have yourself to blame - not us
at this point just stop
Good support at 25. I like my long term hold. Im not here for get rich quick
consolidating
yea
People on this sub are so dumb, it literally ripped 188% up in a month, that is not healthy growth, of course there is going to be a pullback after a moon like that
Lol look at these two retards above me.  

Gme garbage volume. Garbage company.  And a short squeeze that gets kicked down the road every time it's supposed to happen.
this is actually great for GME because it gets all the WSB paper handed retards out and cools off on indicators and technicals

if the new low is 16 that is incredible and means that the squeeze is that much more likely
Correct! Just 10 days ago I was chanting under $20 was a steal. Under $30 is the new mantra
Pussy. See u in a month when im on the moon
switch to GME
Duh
Premarket you mean? Goldman Sachs upgraded it to 60$!
Because its up 400% YTD
beat their own expectations moderately, not enough to justify value
Earnings were priced in
I know it will because I wouldn't double down on TSLA @ 566. The market ALWAYS does its damndest to educate me.
Or one of those pump to 10 and then mehhhhh into red
Show position my nibba

For real I only got 100 shares and 10 calls because I felt SPY puts was gonna be the safe play

Yes
The latest episode was one of the best of the entire show
only season 2 i watched was BREAKING BAD
Nah
No there are a lot more variables that lead to a increase or decrease in stock prices
I think theoretically in a vacuum yes. 

But It really depends on how your broker shows ah. Some show last transaction, some show the midpoint of the b-a spread and others just show the spread
Would execute at the lowest sell price/order ie 100
Good to know I'll just stick to eating crayons
Sell at open
Sell half at open so you at least get your $$ back
Sell at open. Any dip will kill all premium. You have no time to recover. Theta burn will kill you also

My man
Yeah ES only broke ATHs..
2nd time rejected... with impending vaccines ain't all that good.

Glad I kept myself from FOMOing into RIOT or MARA.
Did the exact same thing last week when it hit ATHs. Last time it retraced back to 16,600 before recovering. Looking to see where this bottom is. May need to get out of RIOT until this settles down. Down 1300 in 30 minutes. Oof
It's down 1%...
It does have a really hard support around there huh. It always bounces off and goes to 34 or 36. Earnings helped it this time.
Might delete later
Jesus how?
Lock up over.

Nah, VRAM calls is the way to go. RTX 3080 Ti up to 100% VRAM growth next year. Moonbound.
RTX is the bomb,
neither
Neither have as much upside as you think if you factor in dilution and debt. CCL in particular has a lot of debt that can be converted to shares which will cause further dilution. 

You may get the retard pump with the autists here who have no idea how dilution/debt affects share price, but over time this thing is probably about fairly valued.
CCL next week long ATM call.
I was promised some red
Numbers werent bad at all. Slow down in growth but wasnt a bad quarter
If it aint sub 10 then theres always time
If it's not zero you can do puts. It's a dumb stock and they just lost a shit ton of value, so I wouldn't be surprised if management doesn't pull a pop trick to try to restart the pump. Not sure what that trick might be - deal rumor or something - but could easily see it popping before hitting the basement. Timing will be everything if you do puts.
Just discovered I have 200 warrants I must have bought half drunk a few months ago. Had to even look up what merge with. Never heard of Skillz but I am also getting old. 

Maybe should buy more..
They let things get so shitty that nothing phases us now.

Abml has more upside to it, up 70% in two days on equities lol.  But I might get banned for suggesting a penny stock.  But if you look at the fundamentals they are clearly partnering with tesla. They even built a battery recycling center next door to Tesla in Nevada.

J Pow talking soon that's why
Idk. But I could see 130 by next week. Weekly chart is crazy bullish its about to explode up
100%
At least 124
How will AAPL be affected by TSLA being added?

Indexes have to rebalance and aapl is the biggest portion of the S&P so won't it have the most index selling to make room for tsla?

Yupp
Howd you do it?
EOW

I wouldn't if I were you hoss, maybe tomorrow though. Puts at about 2:30pm, open will rise a bit then crash

I think we will need a merger before the end of the year for it to gain momentum in the near term.
Moved by like 1% aint no thang
RSI off the charts. Will wait
I am simple man. I see retard buy put. I inverse and buy call
I sold out a week ago after two terrible days. Big ragret.

See you at earnings. Ill buy you a rope.
For real. Then turn around and sell them back to GME for half price. Then GME sells them again at full price
Go down first so my calls will fill.

25% of my portfolio is INTC. Shares at avg $48.37 and  Jan 2021 calls. 

I know its a boomer stock, but it should be at 60 and I think itll get back to it. The sell off after AMDs good earnings report like 2 quarters ago was a big overreaction
https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/

Read this, 15.80 drop before bounce was predicted
Hopefully, I've been sitting by watching the Nov rally in the non-megacap tech guys and def regret holding such large positions as they just kick around a bit.
This is the worst acronym ever. However, Id like NVIDIA to pull it dick out of the sand and go back to $600
Theirs is a particularly unique situation. The perfect race-to-the-exit scenario that they've constructed is so far able to completely suppress the bounces from algos and traders thinking it's oversold. I see more downside before a proper bounce.
Its okay itll recover
I think it may run down a bit more so I will wait a bit longer. Could also wait to buy the next ATH and watch it drop
God not during this free fall. Might pick up some when Im reassured that its not going all the way down
Not yet
Always has been
what happened
Yes I love when the government lets China shit on us and does nothing about it
Nah. Stim pump and J Pow to the rescue.

Next week I'm hoping for a nice run once they get the FDA approval. This will dictate if I am quitting my job in March.
It is a beautiful thing
same but buying puts
what happened is it's up 140% the last month lol
Compare it to normie gains and you are doing fine. Maybe 10 feet off your future yacht
shorts ran out of ammo?
Please be true. I want some dirty  tendies
So what I'm hearing is that my puts will print even harder?
That's a timer my dude
Cutoff chime for the next speaker
Reincarnate
It was $14 one week ago. Not sure how holding 17% up for a week on a red day is dead. More like $16 is the support
ZM is a straight up shit stock
Yes. BB to the m00n.
Too late tho news is priced in
Thats dumb
Cyclical
Yeah and you know what else happened last 3 quarters? Everyone sold off before the earnings call
idkkkk... i'm in and 99% of the time i buy something it goes down.. sorry
god damnit do I wish... also you, GOOG!
GME 20 EOD
Ooooof
Why would he?
Probably got banned for spreading nonsense
Trine acquisition Corp?
Youre a fucking idiot. Stay strong
I bought calls on Friday too, 12/11. Everything is red this week just hold awhile longer
If you like stocks that drop 10% out of nowhere then sure, youre right on time
Bought at 41 because of fuck it. Do it. Im selling everything at 45
I think it can go both ways, it's my first call buy ever today and I think that the first one's free sooo  


Yesterday I also thought PLTR was going down so I trust my own retardation. Charts look nice for CRSR.
Deal with AWS
I agree but I don't think the dip is quite over yet
This is the way.
probably because they all screamed up like 75% in the last two weeks
Deal with Amazon for cloud services.
AMZN partnership I think
Deal with AWS
amazon partnership
They made a deal with Amazon.
Makes no sense. Were below last week levels after pretty good earnings.
It's the real short squeeze
BB has spent the last 5 years pivoting to security software for EV's and other industries from smart phone securities, i spent a lot of time researching them a few months back, this AWS contract proves they are legit, buy a little bit if you're unsure! i loaded up this morning!
Ya dude.
Bought 20 12/4 21C
Ban
They're knight rider now
They dont do smartphones anymore they do some enterprise shit or something.
They do car infotainment systems for cadillac etc
Money machine go brrrrr time.
BUYERS AND SELLERS. BUYERS AND SELLERS

PIMPS AND WHORES. PIMPS AND WHORES.
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Inversing WSB, 12/31 $360p
What kind of retard hops into a stock after it goes up 50% in a day
Its already up 50% in one day do you think itll go much higher?
yesplsdaddy
Im close . If TEsla can moon one more time I will unlock green mode
How low would it have to go for you to buy it?
It's going to $90.
Have faith!
$124+
$200
pump then dump
heard of sector rotation before? well WSB is so powerful on the internets now there's retard rotation.
MM shaking out the paper hands so they dont have to pay them out
Lol
definitely
Zm loves staying between 400 and 500. Pretty close to bottom here, would not buy any deeper than 390p. But it may also take off again since it's oversold. I'd probably stay away for another couple days, or buy monthly calls honestly
Rise up
I see GME dipping, I buy.
Went up $5 from yesterday , you missed your chance man
very high
Very likely
high
High IMO
Pretty good
My bleeding butthole is telling me 0
It only goes up
Too expensive for us peasants
Suggestions?
Is market anticipating bad news ?
If it can bust through the sell wall at $123, next stop is $125
Im just getting started tbh
British retail?
Why?
You should just do a 100$ lotto on like a 330-340p
MMs dont get long on a stock. They dont care which way it goes. They just provide liquidity

Partnering with Amazon...
Makes stuff for Amazon now
lol no, these clowns did it for their own clout
Depends on if the dems go for it. 1 trill is better than nothing I guess?
Both sides want to take credit. Republican's want to pass something under Trump but not too big and Dems want to pass something under Biden. Nothing ever gets done here...
Yep. Made a quick 1200 and got out. Still down today because PLTR
Hold. Squeeze didn't start yet
Add on dips.
How did you get into GME in the first place from being on here and not understanding the play is longer than hold for 5 days and cash out +8%?
8.5C let's getttit

get used to it
Absolutely
Buy
i really doubt they will approve a bail out, dems are pushing hard for a stim for the people?
no.. you buy puts when it was $35 last week
Puts cost insane money right now.  Breakeven is through the fucking mantle of the earth.
Nope. $30 EOY
Is it?
I bought 200 shares for the heck of it lol
Yup, 35% since I hopped on 
Because Congress going to print pallets full of cash

This is garbage stock
The real question is why the fuck were you in BB beforehand lol
Why was spy up in the first place is the real question
It was rising as VIX was gaining for some reason. Im hoping VIX breaks 20 so we can moon even further and get some real confidence
not with McConnell at the helm
Imagine being balls deep in margin during the most retarded market cycle in history
Hodor!
It go back up. Give it a year or two
you got your dump bruh
Next meme is BB. AMD is solid short and long term.
I mean, yea. Like, it won't be able to hold that high.
Puts on BB will be right now will be throwing away money wait for more run up
Same but for March. Up 80%. When the fuck do I sell?
Smart
"canceled" do you mean fucking fired retard?
I know someone who got sacked because were not allowed to short out company/clients. He took out a debit spread on one of them and they said the position he sold counts as shorting haha
its worth it   
For 3 months
way to go - you had to say something.....fck
Big Brain
Does not compute.
Idk. I know nothing about it. 

I just threw $500 on calls because fuck it, tired of missing the mojo
Wondering the same. Take profits and move to long airline calls?
Glad I got out in the Euro morning. Had a feeling this won't hold into that vote.
Exit PLTR for sure. NIO could come back but not for a week or so
Don't exit PLTR lol. News literally came out yesterday that they're going to be monitoring/tracking Brexit. Fucking huge.
buy xpev
Cant wait til NIO day.
Probably weeklies. If youre further out, then its fine. I got mine expiring 3/21.
Same here Im holding
Hahaha legit
Theyre completely unrelated you retard
Blackberry
Let's help it get to 20 EOW 
Watch it fall off a cliff in the next few days as people realize there's not much substance.
When is the vote
I did, but it has been stagnant, albeit green lol come on NOK do some shit
I just got out of TLS. 22.38% gain
what did he say
sell the news
The stock is up 1000% profits will be taken
Do you think it got to more than $50/share for no reason?  All sorts of expectations are baked into all the price movement before news is released.
buy XPEV instead, they are the clear winner in EV market

Odds are decent. Jan more likely though.
Its like someone wanted this sub to get fucked
BB average 5.47M shares. Today: 176.4M. Nice!
market is up 1%.  That isn't theta
These companies don't even make money off vaccines.
Which company, hypothetically speaking?
Good dip to buy right now
yeah the 12/11 600c have been gushing blood all day, small bumps, but gushing blood out the jugular for the most part

I hate that site.....
Yeah... no.
THERES ALWAYS A BULL MARKET SOMEWHERE
Aapl gang feels better
Yeah buy the dip $300 EOW
Might fall back to 12 honestly
yes
These guys don't know about IV. Their profits are cut in half if PLTR has a single flat day, let alone three red days in a row.
right? People buying weekly waaaay OTM & then wonder why they get burned...."bbut where my easy tendies???" 

&#x200B;

children
Get involved in the 
There was nothing wrong with buying PLTR when it sat at 18, the issue is half the people fomo and get in after it goes up 100%
Maybe a small handful of newbie shitposters, but I doubt any of the mainstays here are under 20. Not that there aren't autistic 20-somethings.
2-3 payed out.  the autism is now wandering.
More like Theranos. Enron at least had revenue comingn in.

With that money buy yourself a flesh light and fuck yourself again!
What's it mean
it's crazy how the last day of August looks just like the last day of November. GEX up, DIX down, SPY down. Even the dollar setup is there. just too perfect. it's like a bear trap for people who actually care about this lol

Where did all my SPAC lords go? I'm so glad I bought 20 shares and not 200, this is nuts. Think I'll double up though
Not true for GME its fucked me till my ass bled
Its up 150% in the last month
Earnings call isn't until next Tuesday after hours, anything that is/was going to happen happens then. Wednesday/Thursday will be when the squeeze starts if it does

PLTR retards so mad and sad. you literally got warned about a short term drop and didnt buy puts to capitalize

Idk how the SEC allows these fuckers to drive prices down for personal gain like how is that legal.

Hello, fellow bagholder!
true if we close above that point, remind me!
TA ban.
I'm a PLTR bull but this is wrong. Needs to hold $24.04 and break $28 to change the hourly trend back to bullish.
I got biochemistry/math and face the same problem.
seriously these people are holding us back as a society. 

You dont need a degree to take pictures or read a horoscope.
Its true you know?
I'm getting a CJ degree cause it gives me a 20% raise as soon as I get that dumbass degree.

Lol anyone taking these jobs due to AA numbers should feel bad, you cant cut it on your own and you need a government mandated program to get the job for you. LOL you should feel like your not worthy, I know I would.
> the people best for the job should be sitting

And that is exactly the kind of people these companies would hire, unless you want to tell me that there aren't enough women and/or lgbtq folks to qualify.

This ruling is simply to give these companies the push they need to get into the 21st century
This is only the beginning.
Except companies aren't doing that, you dipshit.  
That's why these rules are required.  


  
Why else would these companies have no women or minorities on the boards, except sexism or discrimination? Unless you think there are zero qualified women or minorities...?
Capitalism, or the free market dictating who gets what position, only applies to the poors, not wealthy corporations and institutions dummy.

How
Blowoff top incoming, panic buyers are going to come out
Haven't we learned that's beacuse everyone is YOLOing on options and fucking up the way volatility is calculated? I thought the september stagnation/crash was just because softbank randomly stopping buying up tons of contracts.
You seem trustworthy, I'm in.
BUY
Yup!
After seeing all this crying I bought the dip to ride this out with you losers. Of course they were OTM Weeklies.
Pump and dump
NIO died a while ago lmao
if you dont know what IV is then you are truely lost 
The past 3 weeks have been on easy mode until pltr and crsr dumped.
True true
I made 50% on my NKLA puts this morning, sold right away.  Still money to be made there in puts IMO
Ive made 144% on NIO soooo I think being on the meme train works sometimes. As long as you get off early
I'm not
Carefully, hes a hero.
I bought shares Monday and lost $100 already fml
what dip are you referring to? It's up 35% and steadily holding
Wrong sub
It is if youre not greedy
its fine if you dont buy same week expiration
It's the same with shares, anon. Especially if you browse this sub, it'll make you feel like panic selling your shares.

Holy cow
Fuck yea we did!
Post positions?
I've been tempted all week to load up on puts. I feel like an idiot now for being so pussy.
surrrreee
Yes, remember when everyone was panicking about NIO going to zero cuz they're morons who sell for a loss?
Yes. Im 600 shares deep 
eventually... but it's overpriced still. I'm looking to buy in the teens
Sir, this is WSB
yes. stay long.
We need news.  Watch closely as we near the first wave of vaccine distributions they are tracking
Contracts with US and UK governments, an actual product to sell, it will do fine. Worst bit of news was a notorious short seller with a <1 month time frame still expecting it to stay above $20
Its a real company with long term tailwinds. Not like GME. So probably eventually yeah
Ask r/investing with your shares.  This is Wall Street bets.  Options only
Crazy how far it went in a week
No

Yes
Realistically is this bill going to pass though?
How are you down bigly its still green? Lol
Bought into the meme. But Im holding 12/11 call. So Im hoping itll bounce back up.
The stock can't moon the same way it did pre split, hasn't had back to back 3% days since
yeah, the lame ass stock has only gone up 13% the last month, 50% in the last 6 months, and 60% YTD.

It has to go up 90 plus your buy price in 3 days , if it doesnt go up 35 per day its off the pace
Share price movement has to beat the expectation of movement, which is partially indicated by IV. Look at the breakeven price and see how far the share price is from it, with only 3 days left.
you bought a rly otm call, ur getting hit by theta
Because TSLA isnt going up ENOUGH for that contract to be worth anything by Friday. If it was a few months till expiry it would probably be up
?
Who the fuck has NKLA shares lmao
Milton has almost 100 million shares. Thats one guy I guess.
>Right here papi
Imagine if you reworded your comment as an advice to our new/inexperienced brothers...
I know right, god forbid some novel ideas for plays get tossed around here
LUL someone mad he fell for the THCboi pump and now he wants to make some "DD" so he can dump it
Jumped in with some late December and January $10 calls
Bullish
Does this mean itll tank?
Where does it open tomorrow
I cant believe the move its had so far
... missed the NIO wave?
A hundred years ago my grandparents were poor share croppers in Havana, FL fighting Jim Crow law and Klan members. Now, all my friends are 10 shades lighter than me and we gamble our money away on 0 DTE. Nothing is the same.
stfu
Nothing now keep buying options bitch
Boomers ignored their problems and ended up full of ignorant hate. Our generation gets depressed because we are the first to recognize these problems as something real but don't have the best outlet to relieve such feelings.
I got option all over NIO and Xpeng and I was suffering yesterday but today I'm hard again 
Was thinking the same thing too
U cant pump apple in Reddit, its too big
It was Newton, not Beethoven ROFL
this was right after Mozart discovered the theory of relativity
An apple also got us booted from paradise

Murdered.
Look at gold
If you think that's market open, you're retarded. If it's something else and you didn't clarify, you're also retarded.

Welcome, you'll fit in here.
Till what?
Until?
Its so easy isn't it - just wait for red then buy more and the next day its green :)
lol sour? no my friend - this market is on steroids and this is only the start. We should be at 400 SPY by end of year
If you're ready to sell at the current price, CC's are good except if the underlying goes down too much before you get exercised out. If you're worried about the stock taking a downturn in the near future, exit directly or set a stop. 

With CCs, If you lose more value in the underlying than you received in premium for the covered call, then you'll be holding a loss. At that point, if you still believe in the stock, you're good, just sell more CC's. But if you wanted out, you're stuck holding the bag.
Only way it goes sour is if you dont actually feel comfortable getting rid of your shares at that price. If/when the price moons, you gotta be comfortable selling and moving on to the next play
They are all depressed
Definitely has its uses, I always think of Deep Leaps (ITM) as just a leveraged way of holding the stock without using margin
id rather have two ATM, but I dont buy them both at once just in case I need to average down later. Can also trim one contract off when you get to a good gain and let the other one ride. Less room to play with with only one ITM contract. I guess it also depends on how risk tolerant you are with your delta.
I prefer strikes that I can buy at least 3 of. That way I can sell 60% at 60% profit and recoup 90% of my cost basis
200c 1/21 hop on the train!
So I dont know anything about steel,  but does the price of US Steel track the cost of steel?
Stimmy talks. Dems are in and theyre cooperative. Stim is baked in.
BNTX is better. Same vaccine with smaller market cap.
I'm selling the 370cs I bought yesterday at open 
This was me 3 weeks ago, after like 6 months of wasted time. Since then I've tripled my balance to over twice my initial deposit. Play smart, wait til you got full day trades, and jump on something meme-y that's dipped.
I havent used it in probably a year. We switched to teams and I like it better.
I do! Its pretty solid
Yes.  Very simple to use but does tend to glitch from time to time.
Its a plague for effective communication. Everyone constantly interrupts your work. Theres a reason its called slack
Got a buddy we make fun of for holding BB for 10 years since he first got a 401k. Never gonna hear the end of this now
its the right price, just the Canadian price
they're predicting the future, buy!
Probs their Canadian market price
He the type of dude to do just that. Stay away from that stock
Buy the BNTX dip before the Dec 10 meeting
bntx. 1/2cap of mrna but way more contracts/production/and only 1/3 sideeffects of modernas vaccine
yeah it showed up on unusual large sea based mammals.
The market isn't open, neeeeerd
Don't think it's done tanking
Don't do it man!
Why would you? What's your thesis for a pump?
facts
same :/ always pfizer tho!!
I did that at open yesterday. Cashed out 5 min later and made 10k
Not to play w Pharm stonks. Guaranteed to disappoint. Too many good moves right now to jump on the kiddie rides.
BNTX 150c
highest you can go!!!
They go up and down too frequently, you'll def be buying at the top. Let it fall and buy before FDA approval.
When its high pre market is it a good idea to buy in?
Yes
BB even better
Calls, infinite short squeeze bruh

Ive posted like 20 times a day screaming about gene editing but everyones like Im in CRSR, not CRSP.
Been balls deep in 1/15 $12 calls for a month. Tendie Town, USA
Maybe because it hasnt moved in 3 months?
Stubborn bagholders just buying the dip

this as well.

what the fuck man. I'm gonna hold for maybe a couple more days, see how things pan out. Might just be insiders trying to pump right now before selling.
Can't go wrong with dollar general. See a new one pop up every month.

Selling a NIO put or a long call on SQ maybe?

FOMO lol don't worry man that's what fucks 95% of the people here. There are so many opportunities. Your goal should be not to lose money and keep playing
you should have been quiet, Citron heard you and is trying to tank it.
GME and APHA dips
you need more than weed if you think $500B+ tsla has more juice in the tank....buy those long calls! Better yet buy the stock - post picks

Yep earnings play has turned into a meltdown.
It just keeps going down, maybe earnings today will pick it back up
Stimmy news
anticipation of jpow being dovish being priced in minute by minute
what's he gonna say?
Everytime J-pow speaks...he gets bearish. Argh.
What are we expecting?
Yep, SPY mooning, every call I have red except for TSLA which is holding on by a thread, totally logical
what you mean everything red foo - everything gapped up AH and it's currently 10am - you don't know shit about "everything", give it a few hours we will have most indices up by 1-2% it's the start of winter, vaccine talks, reconvened congress for stims

Hell yes hold. Selling pressure all week as Trevor dumps his steaming bags.
Mu 60c fds?
No word of Trevor dumping stock yet. I ended up just taking profit. Last couple days have been wild for NKLA. Might get back in if news hits though
Don't think any have yet, looks like there's a floor of held shares at 17
Don't think it's going much lower before it charges upwards.  Don't miss your opportunity.
thanks
BB
Zoom is so last March dude
I did.

It might slow bleed out the next few weeks / months but theta will start to eat away unless your already ITM.

Might not be any more catalyst for a huge drop until April when the next round of lock outs are up.
Wrong. We moved from nio to nkla. It will rise

I want to exit. Too depressed to take the hit though.
Leaps and shares will eventually pay off bigly. At least, I sure hope so!

profit taking?
yes, but it started on November 6th
that's been a consistent not heart attack everyday for me stock lately
You missed the boat, plenty of time earlier this year to buy in around $10 a share
This is actually what happens every time.
Good for you!
Yeah, WTF. Takes out my puts and then crashes
Dollar cost averaging the dips. This would be one of them.
Theyll be back up to $180-183 within a few days. They always cycle playing off sector

MRNA damn near doubled over 3 trading days. Some scale back is reasonable.

PFE is just along for the ride. Similar graphs. MRNA just bid up a hell of a lot more.
Only MRNA ...too much of a run up
Cant wait to unload my bags lol
It will fall ....get out
shilled like a MF here yesterday.
Buy leaps
No APHA is the way
that's too conservative for this retard market
I sure hope so.
Just bought 100 shares and not really paying attention, prob start selling covered calls to make up for the loss.. I knew it wouldnt be a quick thing lol
Pltr will go up again
Pltr gang still here, I played it theta gang tho. 

Making money on my puts and calls still
Holding PLTR longterm and holding GME, sup?

It's lost in purgatory, neither dead nor alive. I don't think it knows what it wants to be.
baba is an amazing pick for leaps. The monthly options will die since its a internal battle between mega corps and CCP.
Start pumping plz
Over bought for now, hold until FDA and EU approval 
They issued more shares recently. The selloff caused by this dilution is going continue for quite sometimes imo
Absolute favorite ETF
Amen. I sold short term calls last week, holding my shares and bought 12/4 puts yesterday lol some ppl

What's really good is the articles out there saying it was upgraded today and that the price target is $59.

I guess investors don't read the market news.
Been fucked since pre-market.

I updated windows, restarted my routers, and tried another network before settling on schwab being fucked.
Yessss
Platform is trash lately. I make sure to send them a message every morning- FIX YOUR PLATFORM!

Just sell the contract  before or you might end up with oil 
You need cash
You resell it for a profit before expiry
Sell it

Whats the reason for the big spike today? Any news?
Guess who sold TSM this morning for a slight profit

This is how you collect premium
Tsla
SPCE has long term goals after it's short term lucrative travel plans.
Look at all the 1 trillion dollar companies then look at tesla, make your own decisions
Tsla
lmao the problem is as soon as your "innovative, solid company" doesn't rocket to Betelgeuse and goes down 2% you'll come complaining to the rest of us.

&#x200B;

meme or die
Better than losing it all like these weed stock and Chinese EV company retards
sell the news
Hopped the APHA and PLTR trains myself. Not sure I want to go where theyre going.
LOL acb a piece of shit. Dump it boys switch to puts
A class action lawsuit was filed against ACB. Been known for a while so should be priced in but the deadline for investors to 'participate' is today and a reminder came down 15 minutes ago. I think APHA just had a sympathy tank.

I bet a lot of people who had no clue that this lawsuit wasn't news are the ones who sold off lol.
drill to the moooooooon
THCBee is safer if you're just getting shares
get THC-B and just hold on and don't paper hands til the merger announcement.

Good at 20

Nothing, most SPACs are down, including Thicc Bee. 3 Dec was shareholder vote to extend day iirc
Mate, I'm just as amazed as you are. Still expect tomorrow to be a blood bath (or whenever we get vote news) but still. Miracle.

Waiting until it drops around 375-390 before I get back in

You wanna short a company that made it years and years with barely any product on the market and now landed a pivotal contract with AMZN validating its progress as a software company....?
Lol is this the shit from StockTwits
Missed the wave now I'm just sitting here in the middle of the ocean.

But what's in it for him?
Very sexy
Nah. Not unless youre looking for shares for the long term honestly. I think its done running up.
Spy puts right now.
SPY giving you a juicy dip rn before moon mission
100%. They took basically all of the Christmas shopping this year for themselves and the stock hasnt budged. ER will be spectacular for them. ER will also be spectacular for Apple because of timing issues on phone sales.
phat
love it
Never deviated
It always has been.
end of this week bro
I like this one
If those shills were cia I am not impressed
go trade pokemon cards if you're asking wsb for trades
Bb
It always pumps 1-2 weeks before ER then sells off
Think bigger!!
Its so annoying that their earning  date is after the Jan expiration, and there are no weeklies yet to play a runup/ IV expansion
Get in on applied materials too.  It's a rock solid company with plenty of room up to still move. The entire semiconductor sector is booming, except for maybe intel.
ya the SEC should investigate him for propping up the market
My TWM calls appreciate your sacrifice as they are revived from the dead.
Never a doubt in my mind CRSR would rebound. Didn't think it would be so fast, but they're a great company.
yes
doesnt work that way
update fixed it for me
Same. Bought calls at 11. Press F
Institutions dumping shares
In my account to cover a fraction of my daily losses so far.
40% TQQQ, 30% SPXS, 20% across random tech stuff lol and hold 10% for crip toe drops
PLTR @ sub $25
hookers and sniff
Lmao
They do this shit 1-2 times a year since they rebranded from RIMM. It's old.
Good boy
Idk it seems like GOP offer is gonna get lower and lower. No way they are going for a big package. Head of banking committee just said that they dont want anything big like CARES.
It'll tank by that time
Im in QQQ today. Feeling good man. Bought a few months out expiry though.
Edging at its finest
At this point Im just gonna hold through the vote
Hold man theyll go up again
what exp?
always 
I have both but if i were to average up on one right now it would be psth
its profit taking day... revisit tomorrow or EOD
Sounds like a [wash sale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wash_sale).

Though not exactly.
I have 10 
QQQ is for bitches, we playing TQQQ    
lol usually means its a good time to buy
I got interest
why would you even touch that piece of shit? it literally loses more money in the process of raising revenues
There is a partnership with Amazon announced and upgraded price target by Morgan Stanley to $191
analyst upgrades over the weekend due to "then" upcoming black friday estimates, M1 reviews, overall few more bullish cases were stated from them. i got leaps in aapl so im happy but everything can fluctuate in current market conditions, though its moving in a good direction
Big tech breaking out after months of sideway consolidation
Think they're going balls deep on Apple workouts like Peloton.
I like your thinking

Road to 4000 starts this week

Pull out?
No inverse that, but dont forget a couple more inverses for good measure
Can't fkn wait. About time
Got Xmas eve calls, expecting a pump as bball season starts
Up bigly
Hope u like tendies

Price target for me based on the charts is 380 EOY. I loaded up 10 380 12/31 yesterday and cashed out like a pus at 100 percent today. Im loading back up with 375s from my profit just to play it safe

Once VIX breaks 20... jump on the train with me
Wait until its 400 then youll see how wrong you are
Hard to tell since they dont have a merger target yet.
I just bought. Wanted a tiny amount in my portfolio. Also bought FEAC, LMND, and TRNE.
Nah, they don't go up every day. Today is just an off day.
Just find new ones, like TLS or BB
Assuming don't have another mysterious patient death.  That drop sucked but was temporarily at least.
pussy paper hands shall be your nickname
BB?
I know a guy who sold $25,000 worth of NIO stock...in November 2019.  

Hes so happy about that today
Lol VALE gang needs to make a post. His position was 12$ jan calls i think.
No one likes to buy things on sale
My account keeps getting wiped out the longer I hold this piece of shit. I dont even know which mental asylum I should go too to seek a treatment for my retardation
catalyst?
why
Not the top sit down small fry and let the big dogs talk
I read somewhere that if you bought stocks that just made new all time highs, you'd actually make a decent return.
If Europe okay it in the next couple weeks I think itll pop off
you mean BB 
Yeah makes me want to push it off a cliff.
they sent that to everyone ya tard lmao
so youre the guy Im losing my money to gg

Had to roll to $127c Jan 8 to cover cause I think itll keep going
Looking good - lol I had so much slv calls I sold at a loss a month ago.
I've been holding a few 12/24 contracts. 

Feels great being invested with something with a concrete catalyst. The most difficult part will be finding the best point to sell
Just like it says on the tin
I know this is WSB, so shares are gay, but Im bullish holding shares on HD.
Thinking of holding till EOW
I would sell, I got shares and buying puts now to protect
Might sell a couple wants its plus 123 and hold a couple.  Has been consistently going up but who knows
Buy in
He's gonna take all those financial benefits and give it to the homeless/addicts in San Francisco, Prop C style.
Debit cards with online purchases are sketchy no matter what.
Yeah for sure. NET in particular is stupidly undervalued. In fact I have no fucking clue how it could be valued so little.

Casually runs the fucking internet, they will find ways to make revenue.

U will be one of the 2 major platforms for VR and will deepen penetration in mobile and indy game development. When EPIC goes public going to buy that shit too.
Hold the line on NKLA, itll be $15 EOW
No hope for racists!
automatic
I think anyone who doesn't spam the same fucking ticker every 5 min gets those props.
Would be pretty messed up if after finally making new all time highs, it goes back into another multi-year bear market.

tdoc is going to cliff dive in the next few months, nothing reasonable about it when doctors can use zoom to the do the same thing. or you know, a phone.
it's gonna dump after earnings
Ur welcome I bought at top
No acquisition target = no movement
Still over bought as of this morning, maybe let it cool off a little?
Lol no man. Going red on a 10% open is a bearish down trend

Amd?
AMZN RETARD STRENGTH

APHA* ACB is a fucking sham company.
last few days  pumped PM and bled down all day.  

Let's see if we can reverse that trend today
AAPL down 8% on 3m chart

That's why
Cause they havent done shit since they split.
Thought the same thing on Sept 1st
Zzzzzzzzzz another guy that doesn't know the strategy.
Yeah imma need a link for when you told us all
No you didn't. Looked at your history. Lying's bad for your health
Its doing the same thing over and over again, down, up a little bit, down, up a little bit, down, repeat
We're jerking off to our massive gains and the gains still to be made in 2021
Im a dead bull 
Just picked up 20 $28 12/4 cs. Easy five bagger.
Its almost like stocks go up and down.
Damn you salty af

Lmao
This guy 
How far will it go?!?!
China is an Authoritarian capitalist, there is ironically hardly any communism.
I know people here are retarded, but how do you think the chinese lifted millions out of proverty? It sure as fuck isnt communism 
Eyyy 10th percentile bois 

My magic 8ball says not likely 
because the bill wont pass, better get out before u lose all ur dough
Yes, up or up bigly
I do cause its built into my banking app.
I use it all the time and prefer it to venmo or any other form of e-payment options.
I use Chase Quikpay all the time, and I think that's Zelle?
I do because almost everyone has it even though they might not use it.
I might FOMO my GME shares into BB this morning
I have TOS and I hate it.   If Robinhood had better charts, itd be great.
Num nums

Unless you have puts
Cyber Tuesday special!

Jesus you havent sold yet, poor bastard
Was over yesterday at like 7:40am

I jumped ship for CRSR
Let it go lower then sell
Same. Except call. I was short on cash at the time, kinda grateful for that now.
What happens when you dont take profits
What positions you have?
Funny thing yesterday morning I was like Apple is bout to go on a run lol
LETS FUCKING GOOOO!!
You got my number
Why is it down so much? Was there bad news?
Fool me once....
Im in! 250 shares
Are you tripping brother?
How and why would that happen before the inclusion date?
Up or down
I agree. 1200.
Only after all the S&P money managers are forced to buy Dec 21.
For me that would be most excellent
Thats hilarious

BUY BUY BUY
This insight brought to you by RKT
I found them:


lmao unless you were an idiot and bought in at the high most people with PLTR still have a huge profit. But this is WSB so of course most people bought in at the high
Agreed
Congrats
Sucks to be you
Oh you're fukd bro. Endless bull rally started last night.
Ive downgraded CRSR to `hold` from `buy`.
Why?
Oh yes  congrats
Dude ikr 238 was too juicy
Yeah but they will end up buying the cheaper digital only consoles.  Gme has no future.
This is the way
Can only end one way
Call back spreads are your friend
Ill probably live with the dip. I never want to watch this stock from the sideline again.
Thought about that too?  Like ok now what, normal growth?
before then
Mexico is legalizing, plenty of companies have international interests.
I had the Jan calls. Wish I never sold. Idk why I have such paper hands
I've never seen one of these post be correct. Ever. And I'm holding 590 calls for this Friday but when I see this retarded shit I feel like shits about to tank
Oh man, a whole $0.161!

Now worth a whole $ .7294 per share!
MOOOODS
MERGER
VROOOOOOOOON VROOOOM!!

What time he speaking
Jettas are for hot girls only
Is Porsche creating another short squeeze? If not, I'm not interested.
Boomer stock.
Why do you think anyone will care in the markets?
Funny
How do that?
About fucking time. Was considering dumping it yesterday and pumping some meme stonks, but decided to hold for the long haul.
Why did ya choose 140???? Should have taken to 130, so much more realistic.
Pull out bro its not hittin that
Dont sell Tesla before s and p lol
Its gonna moon through the week. We could see Tesla at 650 EOW
Going with option 2
Don't have to look far. Just look at people buying otm apple calls the expire this month. $150 strike lol
Legit questions are usually downvoted so be thankful.
take your logic over to r/investing, bitch
15c 12/18 checking in
I keep looking to see if there has been any unusual option activity.
4/16 16c. No worries
Lmao, here comes the China shill folks

Also, the proper way to play the weed stocks is to own both, nimrod
Isn't that what IV is for?
I still wouldnt touch em with a 10ft stick
Means no one is selling
Bargain. There will be slight issues w the Vax, always are. The committee that approves has the liability. The liability on this will be fuking enormous. There will be some bullshit pushback to make it appear the agencies are doing DD. There will be a dip.
I think it has more diversification product wise.....more exposure to medical market.
dial son
>Also HEXO
I did 5k > 1k in one day. Shouldn't be too hard
I did 200-8.5k in two weeks
Shit Ive gone from $800 to 5k in a day, its most definitely possible
NIO calls and NKLA puts
i thought TSLA is replacing a certain stock... isn't it like they will sell that and then comes TSLA?
Ahh interesting didnt think of the other side to funds have to buy Tesla.. makes sense they will need to make room for it
Happy cake day
So puts for SPY dec18?
Long GE calls
Get back to cleaning toilets. We dont buy shares
Before that starts get your nio calls in order
BB
Even ETrade's been hanging at open
So frustrating
I jumped yesterday to watch today, glad I did.
Fuck you stop selling and hold so it can go up
buy the dip bro, literally cant do tits up
They told you to buy at 14 not 33
Got 10K in balance waiting for the right moment.
Same. APHA calls right off the fucking rip and I get blasted
Imagine not smoking cannabis right now
dude, gtfo of that shit
The chad $40 by 12/7 vs the virgin $32 by 1/1
Not yet...I think it will bleed all day.
Have fun catching that falling knife.
You think after the 12/4 and 12/11 calls are up, my 12/31 calls will be a little safer?

I would say it depends on how much you put in those positions. If they small beans, I would let them ride out just to see where it goes but if its something you can't afford to lose then sell.
yes
Agreed. Its the best stock of them all
I would be moist if I could pick up NIO for under 45.
Thats the dumbest thing you can do
easy there buddy, everything is on sale.
This is a fuckin fact too. They're partnering with AWS to provide EV data collection. Bruh. They're still being valued at failed palm pilot valuations
I do not know you or anything about you but I am trusting your judgment
Why? It already popped on the news.
Its already up 35% you dongus
you want people who lost everything on meme garbage to invest in another garbage meme?
Just did, may the gods be with us
Seems like you are missing out on making money right now.
GTFO
not yet hold...
Averaging down
I'm holding still my 40 shares
[Still on Schedule for next week](https://as.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/)
they giving you the same amount if you were to trade a game into them
What the fuck else are you gonna do retard, lose money?
Hold and sell covered calls
Weigh risk and reward. If you can lose all that money for potential gains sure, if not idk if its rallying from this for awhile.
Yes
Look at all the other stocks that got pissed on.  Give it time to recover.  PLTR is solid with solid backing.  Forget about the meme status.  The company will last much longer than we will.
if u can't handle 17% don't buy stocks
I'm down alot more but not worried.  I got time.
Dont sell your shares. The stonk just did 150% in a month and youre worried about 17%. Know what you bought, do some DD and dont panic.
You are a hero. I salute you! 
Made 100% on them (was 200%) gains are gains
Ehhhh probs not tho
Fuck yeah. This might be too responsible for this joint, but solid advice
This is the way.
Think about what youd want to do and then do the opposite
Shares fam. Thc will double in a month
it's a beautiful thing.

some men just wanna watch the world burn
OG left
Lol
I believe its Get M fuckEd.
Fomo is one hell of a drug

wheres your data from
You can make money both ways, ya know.
Me too cant find any decent plays right now
I see it plateauing at 22ish for a long time
same. I sold yesterday bc it was going down...
Just buy now, this is the dip
nah, don't be bitch. just continue to buy
From you or is this a top indicator lol
When Thots starting getting in, I think it's time to dip
maybe eod for profit taking tomorrow
Dude what the fk are you in?

Thats the most retarded shit Ive ever heard, why do you need two apps?
Let us drag it up then
I think its the guh word lol
Snitches get stitches.
Got that too.. If anything it made me feel dumber
Woah now lol. Im all for Tesla hype, but lets be real. Its up 50% in like 2 weeks. I argued in favor of Tesla when people said it was overvalued at $400. But $600-700? Were getting into risky bubble territory. Just being honest
Lmao what kind of a sale is this?
You haven't heard of PLTR huh
puts on my creampai
uhhh its not
Time to break out to $3300+ though fr
And then remember its going to $100 long term so who gives a fuck anyway.
No worries, it will be back there by Friday.
Anything over 27 by end of week and I'm good
Why would that happen
It wont
Doubt. They are looking to pass a lot of stimulus. Bigly down or bigly up through the new admin
fuk
as long as FED keeps rates at 0 then ppl dont have anywhere better to put there money besides the stonk market
fucking sell covered call  
Y do u think nobody wanted that mook
Dont. If you green,  count your blessings. Those who want it all, lose it all lol

Its only income or a realized loss when you sell.
Depends how much are realized vs unrealized. Your brokerage will send you a tax form at the end of the year. Send that to your accountant.

Source: I'm a CPA
Lol u have a lot to learn my friend.

U have to report every sale you had. Then they get netted. And if U sold any and bought back within 30 days u cant take that loss
if all this happend this yr, and u finish the year up $800, ull pay capital gainz tax on ur $800
Ill take it in a heartbeat. You get a flu shot, right?
I'll take your spot in line
Ill take it
I have a phobia of needles. I'll be first in line for one of those. Need to set an example for the retards.

Also if it is indeed a Reptilian Communist Liberal way of controlling my mind and my bodily fluids, same retards will notice and double down on not getting the vaccine. It's a win-win either way. You're welcome.
Been living this whole time, not so much as a sniffle. Why the fuck would we?
Nikola trying to be relevant with its imaginary revenue when We have Tesla and NIO printing cars like a photocopier
I wonder when they'll say "get scammed, nerds". Probably when Trevor is done dumping.
This is the most hilariously wrong bull spit Ive ever read.
People around here get fixated on a stock. So rather than riding it through meme stage and moving on, they stay with it for Weekes or months after trying to relive the glory days.
Like what? Examples?
If we make too much money then it makes it all real.  

We want to stay juuuust poor enough to enjoy the shenanigans and be retarded.

Bro I'm holding my shares for at least a year. Selling now would be dumb imo
Im holding to mine snd buying more today
If I had shares I would hold indefinitely. This company is the future.
Holding them like TSLA back in the days. Maybe I can buy a second lambo.
You just said youre long holding shares.... wtf?
You know its not all in or out sell 20%
Holding over a year for tax cap gains. Really trying to not harvest anymore profit this year, hope I can hold off until 2021
what % of your account is 106 shares?
Write a covered call
Sell
Try holding it for longer than a day. Its gunna pop off
Plug is actually manufacturing fuel cells which is hard to say about literally any other fuel cell company.
Why?
Put it into PLTR instead 
Meh, when something is this cheap can't get spooked by percentages.

its only down 21 cents.
Yeah it gives queasy vibes
We always tank at open
Apha
Whats even a good expiry for this?
Nahhh
Are you new here?
What sub do you think you're on...
Hell yes, the more we buy it the more likely the shorts will have to cover meaning a huge squeeze
BUY
Looks mighty tempting
buy at EOD, it (almost) always spikes in the morning, spends all day going down, then ends barely green
Nah. Gaming is moving digital. Unfortunately, GameStops days are numbered.

Not a bear, just honest.
I bought 5 shares just in case there is a short squeeze. If not, dont mind the loss
I wouldnt lol
Yes my son
can you buy me a pizza for lunch pls
it's not a one day thing you paper handed bitch, buck up
no
Wait for earnings on the 8th
Looks like we got bamboozled
All the posts say wait till March or at the very least after earnings. Patience is a virtue calm down.
you really think this one will print?
joke?
Lol its fucked
They are too smoothed brained to think ahead more than a few hours dont bother. Those who stayed in or bought the dip make money
post your all time graph lets see it
next week will be GME loss porn

What technical analysis gives you that feeling ?

Yes this is bullseye as a Healthcare worker.
Bullshit
PLTR is the only good move dumbasses
I'd say so, but I think a lot of people weren't secure in their own investments or risk tolerance. Its a volatile, high-moving stock, you have to brace for negative movements. I'm ready for the second pump.
The company has a lot of long term potential, what do you mean?
Remindme! 4 hours
I knew buying puts when every other post was PLTR euphoria was a good idea!
Imagine being this wrong lmao
loser. just watch
I think you meant end of it's short term meteoric growth. If you aren't long on this then you're wrong.
Maybe WSB losing interest is the best thing for it.  Was killing it till yall noticed and hopped on with the short attention spans and paper hands 
Maybe short term we see more pullbacks, but calling pltr a bubble at 25 is ridiculous

Look up the definition of a recession.
Means not being basically 100% invested is idiotic

Delete Reddit.
Buy some PLTR
Serious tip: stop watching the stock market all day and get off Reddit/social media, and stop watching porn.  Those things suck up all your dopamine and energy so you have none left for studying, thus no motivation or focus. Focus and studying requires dopamine 

Or study before all those things
Stop jacking off/fight porn addiction

Espresso shots (kinda a drug) 

Exercise like an athlete
Adderal, Cocaine, Energy Drinks/coffee/caffeine + L-theanine
There is no secret, when you get tired you can't think as well.  Make the most of the morning and day when you are most rested.  If anything, try getting up earlier than usual to study and go to bed earlier so you are fully rested.  

If you are not getting at least 8 hours of sleep regularly now, then getting 8+ will help you feel more awake at night.
If your at home I like to take a break, exercise, and shower. Then I feel refreshed. 

If Im at the office usually get some fresh air and walk around outside. It resets me.
detox and sleep well. sometimes the hardest place to get to
Drink more water and stop jerking off as much. Hit the gym 3 times a week.
Stop jacking off
Better rest
Get off reddit/twitter/etc

Wtf is a COTY
I sold 3 COTY 8c 12/4 yesterday. So of course  today
Tesla +-5% is a normal day
S&P said ~~all their cronies already got their shares~~ TSLA in the index all at once on 12/21 vs possible bifurcated inclusion.
S&P 500 is spread wide open and will include Tesla as a whole on 21. Are you living under a rock?
Being added to s&p all at once, instead of in phases.  Announced yesterday after close

I sold apex before I went negative. Currently sitting at -100 for THICB
NIO had bad news, PLTR is taking a breather for the next run up.
Leave that shit in index funds. Do your autistic trading outside of it lol trust me
Make your own $BECKY fund and watch the 15-20% yoy gains
Different companies have different rules around what youre able to do with it. Generally, theyll have a list of available groups of funds that you can pick between, but thats about it.
You're some kind of idiot... A 401k is just another brokerage account with withdrawal restrictions. You can "manage" it whatever way you want. Literally picking any popular funds in the last year would've netted you gains in the double digits. How you could've fucked this up is beyond me.
Bro Im not buying a .50% dip on a stock that that just ripped after being flat for 3 months lol
Been waiting for a dip like this in Chinese EV forever..bought the shit out of the dip!!!!! Remember retards..buy low, sell high. Thats how u make money!!

Be hobo, no rent to pay 
Where do you live that a new college graduate (i assume business degree) is making 61k a year?
Username checks out 

Buy TSLA CALLS
Worst case scenario you just take the L on both. You won't be evicted and one missed CC payment won't kill you. I'd prioritize making the minimum CC payment as missing that will affect your credit score vs. your landlord just being a bother for a couple weeks. And it's less money.
They have 12 step on Thursdays.
Lmao work something out with your landlord and move the CC balance into a 0% interest card and float it. Save money up and dont gamble your rent again.
Id say it was a bubble. Still a good company long term.

I dont know what about PLTR makes you want to put your gains there right now.
Hold
I bought for 2 other people
Bought 1,836 shares today

They sell fucking tendies now load up pussy.
If you didnt get yet that the GME play isnt about an actual investment you are more retarded than the average retard around here.  
Nobody gives a shit about what GME sells.  
Nobody gives a shit if there is still a games stop standing in 2 years
They are not a long hold for sure. Everyones in in anticipation of the short sqUeeze
I agree, dont think its a good long play but its on the up right now due to new consoles. So calls are still viable for GME for a few weeks
They think they're so fancy with their 24/7 trading and 10% intraday swings 
Its def going to 200 plus
This is the most uneducated, stupid, naive comment I've ever seen.
Not sure how it'll pan out short term (say, through Feb) but I think it's only going up long-term.

Pretty stupid. In at $14, sold at $26.46. FOMOd and bought back in at $27.5. Now my account shows I lost money on it.
Because it is some shitty china ev company that is way overvalued after a massive run
Too much heat on chinese EV's, NIO dropped by association.
I can answer  your question with another question.


Why did it pump so hard?
Chance Congress may de-list it
lmao bagholder no one buying that pump and dump meme
I still do, holding on to 200 shares. But it's going to take a while in 2021.
before EOY, yea
Dude are you fucken kidding? Patience is needed and you will bloody fly. If you have weeklies then, well, RIP.

Shares? Come back end 2021 and count your gold.
Bagholders only
Yes... Company is overall quite promising.. don't just fall for a tiny dip... You also didn't sell when it moved 20% upwards in a day

Edit:typo
indeed I do, this is just a correction after such a massive runup. I do wish I waited for the correction before buying in though ffs
Just sold naked puts so maybe 
maybe not for 12/4 but yes itll come back
It'll get back to $30 again eventually. Question is how low will it go before going back up.
Yes in 1 to 2 years.

It was speed running but now has slowed down.

Why blackberry
Fallen for that before
Yep, and I'll be buying the whole time
Good luck explaining the difference between market risk and portfolio risk to them lol.

Whats even worse in most of the weed stocks are based out of Canada
You got about 30 posts just Like this over and over lol why you hate weed so much. Maybe you should go smoke you fuckin loser. APHA
Dunno about your state, but in Colorado you have the same requirements for purity in recreational and medical. The big difference is that they tax the piss out of recreational.

Colorado makes its bank on retail, not medical.
Did weed hurt you? All your post are shit talking weed and grim reapers? Dont get me wrong It would never pass the senate even if the house agrees. But no reason not to play the run up until then.
Markets green today man
Wdym SPY is up
What market are yo looking at? Green across the board
the indexes are up like a % wtf are you talking about.  Most shit is up PLTR is dumping because it was a pump and dump, buy once it finishes dipping and spin again.
S&p is up you clown
!RemindMe 6 months
Try harder
3 days of red, technically depends on when u bought
I predict Fri drop as some take profits...they been waiting for three months
Do you have any idea what people are trying to do? We're not buying it because it's a good business...
If it pops here I think it could go to $70. It may have to touch $41 first tho
Maybe not everyone should take out huge loans if you can't pay them back
Why college students drowning in debt?
Yeah fuck peoples livelihoods we should bail out young fucks for debts they created. And then when the restaurants fail all the college kids will be out of their jobs perfect!
No one need grants, natural selection at its finest  
Nah no sympathy for kids burying themselves in debt for a business management degree
Based on what I read here I can believe this. Still 60% sure you are just making this up but who am I to reject good confirmation bias.

Refuse to use Europoors as part of my investing thesis. Only Ameripoors for me

Here and buying the dip
   

Sorry I cant hear you over this wall of tendies Ive made off PLTR for the past month.
Its about to 

Yes, wait for a pull back in the next few weeks. Maybe buy closer to $8. The Amazon thing is a lot of hype.

It might pass, it might not. I would wager on it passing however as the bill was introduced with bipartisan support, was accelerated through the senate passing without any amendments or objections from Democrats.

The house vote is also an expidited vote where no arguments will be held either, this type of vote is reserved for cases where you think the bill will pass with very little fanfare.

So if the bill passes what then? Well for 3 years nothing.
However it's most likely we will see a bunch of panic selling in the short term followed by people realising it doesn't mean anything for now, stock go back up.

Sometime in January dialog will probably start between Biden admin and China to sort out the details. Given what the Chinese finance minister said on the matter I think it's most likely there will be a compromise of some sort to allow either US auditors access or some other arrangement so that US firms are used for accounting (like BABA already does).
Whats a gamma stickyness - all you need to know is stocks/SPY goes up thats it. Stop trying to make it complicated
Didn't sell enough hotdogs
Lol dont listen to these retards. I am the Costco expert here. I called that special dividend one week before it was announced. Check my post. Its ex dividend today because the record date is 2nd but it was 2 days to settle so yesterday was the last day for shareholders to buy in to get that dividend. It was actually upgraded today by some schmuck thats why its not down full -$10
Sector rotation day

Yes, with long dates and atm contracts. 3 to 4 months to expiration. Keep cash on the side to average down or increase position as it ebbs and flows. Close position with absolutely no more than 30 days to exp.

Hope not.  I wrote a $500p 12/24.
If it passes 595 then no, thatd be a bull flag. If it starts getting legs down then yes.

I doubt theyll go below 90 at this point unless bad news but its only gonna get better for them when earnings come
GL regardless on those puts, fella.
About 30 seconds before that giant red candle
Still lot weighing on the stock. I expect it to moon next week, planning to buy on discount.

Yea below $10
It will dip hard but might as well buy WORK, it will rip
Patience
Sold it

Happy?
dont touch it. will tank after earnings this week. I made that mistake last quarter.
team buy high?
look what they did to my boi 
Usually at 10:30, after profit taking is done is a good time to buy
If you buy and hold a diversified portfolio you will be up more than the average wsb trader next year. But you know. Fucking yolo pltr $69 calls!!!
Never
Never. No really, sit on it for a few decades.
nope.
didn't we have all time hights in 9/1?
It's alright! Your calls are still printing, yeah?
PLTR is long hold. Should get more hype for a swing closer to end of first quarter. 2 months out I believe
Long term you shouldn't be worried. I'd just wait and see. If you really need the capital maybe trim to reduce your exposure
Im holding. I dont understand how this announcement of an acquisition was bad for them.

Thought the proposed $800 or so billion included $300/week additional Federal unemployment subsidies, $200 or so billion State/Local aid, the rest a new PPP-like subsidy.

Alternatively what news is about to break on Boeing
partnership for airline financing. Also DJIA=BA so they typically move pretty similarly
Only thing I can see is an article interviewing Alaska Air's CEO getting rid of their A319s, letting their A320 leases lapse, and replacing then with the 737Max.  

But I thought this was old news.
Hold, itll run up
Yeah look at the previous close and the bid/ask you donkey.

Might go to 132 but I would take some profits just in case it doesnt pop back down to 110.
Hold or buy a up momentum has appeared.
The M1 is sounding like a success. Its still first generation but the fact the performance is this good is impressive. I wouldnt call this an iPhone level leap this is pretty significant IMO
You saying its going to go up 20%?  I'm thinking the same.  It tends to recover in the 45 days after ER.

GME 20 EOD
Well, today is hulk green across the aggregate S&P 500. The problem for this sub is that the boomer stonks seem to be taking the lion's share of the day's profits.
you hold leaps until almost expiration..... you are doing it wrong

see Nancy Pelosi
Depends on your time frame and tax issues. I'm holding an AMD 75c for 2022, I could cash out but I want lower tax rates on the profits so I'm gonna wait.
Leaps are long term hold positions. Dont take profits so early.
If you're looking for an adrenaline rush then do weeklies. The purpose of long dated calls is to wait...
If you have leaps you can probably scalp gamma, but why not just hold?
Thanks all.
Up from yesterday
Lmfao
Its Chinese for one thing
News was good and market reacted poorly. Head scratcher but not looking good. Debating the 12/4 60 calls, but man is it risky
This shit hitting $100
Like 75% of my closet is RL. Beautiful brand. Works in the boardroom and rap videos. 
sell the news
Do you even realize what you said? "ATH yesterday, buy calls!" What stupid advice
What's the news
Im dead inside
Up 120% today right now
I have depression
Theres a vote in Congress tomorrow limiting investment in Chinese firms to only firms that comply with an audit that conforms to US regulations once a year (or something like that)
Post positions
I panic sold
Sell, buy S-B-E/ChargePoint instead.
I believe that xkcd explains this quote nicely.

Can u really call that a V?
The sorta thing you could be able to pump and dump, but with quarantine dying down in the next year or so, I cant imagine them being as big a player as they couldve been when quarantine life started settling in
Too late
What's your target for VALE?
trades take a few days to settle, so you likely don't have cash unless you use margin.
Shares are t+2 and options t+1 for cash settlement
FSLY dip fked NET too when it didnt have anything to do with NET 1-2  months ago lol
Andy Jassy keynote for their reinvent conference. he's pumping the company hard. been a good year for AWS.

Dont sell the dip, is what Ive learned.
Yes
You only down 25% if you sell
Rumor is mid December.  

They are also speaking at a Credit Suisse conference tomorrow iirc.
all Spacs are down today. Bad day for us Spacstreet Boys
why
DKNG calls
Ha prime, I get it
AMZN primed
so get back in?
Up 60% cant sell cuz if day trades lol

Rotation into DesperTSLA...
It will if you have gold.
Sold my 363 call at 366 then immediately shorted it at the top. Thoughts and prayers

Gonna be the next PLTR if this keeps up
ZM earnings were expected to be strong too. And then they were. Now look at their price since the earnings report.
BB
Shut the fuck up, not good

Lol this is the one stock where you'd buy options to negate risk
Like em
GE $11 3/19/21 is what I got
Its the nature of options with a ticker like Tesla. Thats how big moves to the upside and downside are priced in. Also theta decay for that exp ATM is less than .50 for an option that costs $104.75 which is not that high especially since Tesla could rip. If your option is way OTM then yeah your theta decay is gonna be high because thats how it works
No where
Down for a week until everyone forgets, then up
From Investors.com

"The bill, which already cleared the Senate in May, could kick Chinese companies off U.S. exchanges within three years. That would happen unless their auditors come under supervision of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board."

Even if they get kicked, it could be three years from now. This drop is just a knee jerk reaction. These is plenty of time to recover. NIO just posted good news so unless it's fake news we should be going up soon.
All I remember is scrolling through that DD thread and nurses and doctors were claiming that LGVW's medical device was top notch and sort of the new standard of use. 

That's enough to sell the idea to me.

More like mid December
BB full on EV stock now
I dumped mine, thought the dry ice they were making for the vaccine transport would of popped it but it didnt happen.
Ask your mom
I believe JD is an OK entry point at $85 but it could bottom at support at $80 again (though I doubt it)
Seems like a good time to load pltr leaps
Bought shares of SOL and sold way otm covered calls.  Like the play long term but I dont see that shit doubling in the next 17 days.
TSM is a fantastic stonk. I very sad I didn't buy in when it had dipped with everything before the election
just bought a shit ton of calls for 1/15/2021 $9
evs are dead.
This is exactly why I got out.
Whoever is holding this market up is just flexing their power. They can let it drop or pop at will.
Premiums are relatively cheap
why
What puts made money r u talking about 

Im loading puts soon not yet tho
Safe, buy any dip on AAPL or AMD

Risky, buy JD $88c for next week
same reason when its up 6%

just because
After news about record breaking online Black Friday shopping... makes sense.
Team solo mid?
Gold
Nio leaps
GME stock
Baba leaps
Hoping it tanks hard but wouldn't be surprised if it makes new ATH by EOD.
It's about time. Pls let my puts on IWM soar.

Looks juicy
Vaccine companies were the easiest money possible this last week.

Ahh, reminds me of 2018 around here.
Shit stocks are down. SPY is up 1.3% today lol
Except spy. The most important one.

Sell the next strike up... at least that's what I seem to recall being the conventional wisdom.
Need to wait for an investor to sell. For some reason they aren't.
I think we're around it
Probably around the 350-370 area.
Always close a spread before expiration. An AH move can absolute fuck you and make you lose thousands on a $1 spread. Look into it
No usually you try to get out in case one of the legs fuck you
Close out spreads before expiration
Y'all seriously need to stop fucking with RH.  It is awful for spreads.
RH will handle, but if youre already at max profit you should just close it manually. If the strike price is too close to your spread and/or dividend will pay on your expiry date you expose yourself to pin risk
3 day rule, give it at least til tomorrow to buy the dip
Not even up 1%  I guess your a 1 pump nut
Unless you bought weeklies, in which case youre just fucked.
You mean calls?
Lol BB 20 by eow
Yeah thought it would sustain in the high 68 range. It's weird how a lot of stocks were up/down a bit at open....you wouldn't know the DOW opened up 300. Now that the DOW is dipping everything else is drifting down.

I bought it on nov 20th after seeing it hyped here. Thinking it may be a good time to bail.
It'll keep gapping down every day pre-market when retail can't FUD sell and cause a chain reaction.
Thats what Im holding, I bought yesterday. Depending on movement to tomorrow I will close for 200% or go for the gold.
Y'all are fucking retarded holy shit
You couldn't have picked a worse day. It's the kickoff of their AWS Re:Invent conference. It's all day of pumping AWS (Amazon).
i dumped all my 140c leaps for strong gains recently but reloaded on shares today. its just being depressed by ZM imo
You made money on blackberry in 2020!

MSFT always lagging and dip at open like a shitshow

I prefer RIOT to OSTK / MARA tbh
some will be transitioned to CRM shares and some cash

SPACs are down today, if you aren't robinhood, buy warrants, if you are, open an account with a different broker

No, Id play it into tomorrow may bounce back

just sell theres better plays to make in this market right now
When my nephew asked me about it, top is in and he did over Thanksgiving.
as amzn goes, so does shop. eow is too short a timeframe.
what is your goal? quick money or lottery ticket? If you want to play momentum perhaps you should just buy the stock. but maybe wait for buying opportunities this afternoon. 8.68 seems like a nice entry.
Well it's up 70% in one day. Sooo
YES 

BB TO THE MOON 
I mean shits gotta go down more right? I have 12/4, 12/11, 12/18, and 12/24
Never. This will rise due to boomer power
lmfao about as likely as my PLTR 36c 12/4 printing. Moderna leaps are gonna be a gold mine imo tho. Should blast through $200+ come jan-feb
thanks for reminding me, need to load up on INTC puts
No
You want it to rise 25% in 25 days?
$3,500 sounds reasonable as it's basically 10%. $4k is 25% and that's doubtful without news of some sort. By end of 1Q21 maybe if Christmas goes well.
No clue. Its all over the place this week
Not looking great rn but if we get volume  tomorrow could be $610 ish judging by the trend
honestly? 595
$620
TSLA 650 by eow
Not looking good. Looks like SPY funds start buying near the 21st not now. and they most likely want lower prices.
PLTR is going back to sub 20. It rose too fast for large money not to take substantial profits. Citron shorters will win this round unfortunately. Theres just too much selling pressure at open. Its always a huge nosedive.
Probably postponed again.  That move yesterday was pretty significant and no doubt a lot of people took their gains.  I'm gonna wait till it cools off to at least 14 before I load up again.
Unless youre dealing with some retard strength stock on a meme week
Just burning theta unfortunately. Really need a good bump up to 600

Ive only got the 10% one, what have you seen
Yea theyre pretty funny looking arent they
Its popping off
I sold at open seems like there is a lot of resistance at $17
Eyeing the 204-205 level. Don't know if it will get there but decent spot to buy. It's setting up for a huge move which should happen by either the end of this month or in Jan if it can stay above 200 until then. I don't know which direction though. It's either going to 270 or sub 100.
Yes always when docu down buy calls. Yes yes yes

edit spelling hard
I'm in
His accountant is handling it for him. Cuck is probably back pouring concrete somewhere in the desert.

Sales will be pre-market and AH to keep market reactions low, stock will keep chipping down over the next couple weeks.
LOL the second I posted this it 
Quite the fake out in the early session. Feels like there was no real reason to be up early, nor much of a reason for the fade.

CVS is more of a value stock so probably just rotation back into tech/growth throughout the day. Maybe it was like 'Sell Zoom, buy CVS' and then changed to 'Sell CVS, buy Apple'.
How do you push out an option?
Push out to Feb for the superbowl

The overall number is way too small and there's ZERO checks for all Americans. In other words, there isn't even a stimulus in the "stimulus" bill. Completely DOA.
I hate the term 'bipartisan' anymore because it's used to imply 'hey Dems and Repubs agree!' when really it might mean all the Repubs and a lone Dem agrees. Or even worse, the group that put the bill together was on a Senate committee which is majority GOP and because the committee is technically bipartisan they say it's bipartisan.

Dems have been pushing for direct checks as a corner stone of any new stimulus. The fact that this doesn't have this seems to confirm my suspicions that this doesn't have much inclusion of Dem concepts.

What are your eod thoughts for amazon
Prolly not for a few weeks these past 2 red days have been insane
Why? It's sitting on support. It -might- go down after the vote but it's definitely going up soon. Unless you are in weeklies (which is retarded) you should just hold.
Lame
Im expecting selloff EOD or tomorrow
Can you dumb It down for this retard on whats that supposed to mean
Got in at 27 and still holding through all these paper hands.
One red day after a 200% month and youre out?! Best of luck!
They going to shake u out and then skyrocket when youre off the ride  just hold strong
this makes me bullish
Please sell me your shares or contracts at a discount
Wtf made you think this today and not the past week lmfao
It always dips before open, watch the gap up and trust it
Not worried holding shares at 18.50 lowest this will get is 24 before it moons again.
You misspelled buying opportunities
i'm holding PLTR long term, don't GAF about short term noise, if anything a nice drop to lower levels to load up on would be welcome.

Greedy fucks I hate premarket profit takers

You shorting the one company that's trying to save the world?
Smart honestly
may as well wait, cant lose much more
sure if you have weeklies like a dumbass

otherwise just hold shares forever
This is why it busts.... either do ur own research or dont blindly follow advice from strangers
If it's not a bust is correcting heavily this week
Short term options maybe but anything long term dont be an idiot, hold
stock, long calls, or this week's calls?
yes, buy high, sell low
*it was not the last chance*
cope
lmao
If you bought that at the top, no

If vaccines are starting to be distributed by then, than yeah probably.
I mean we still got 30 days. Hopefully PLTR can recover within that time and the 7c in premium that gets taken every day doesn't r@pe you
This daily thread is now equivalent to stocktwits
go give them a burning cash reddit award
I mean its a company that can legit hold its value. If you placed calls on it then yeah, you may be fucked. But shares should be fine long term
Sounds like a shit idea
Me too.  A 2% swing is crazy with the IV. Though.
We do not use the F word on this sub thank you.

Been there. I bought a Nio call a year out when it was at 6 bucks. Still holding   
Literally has been talked about nonstop, dont worry I missed it too.
Should have bought in when it was half price last month
Trevor Milton did not do this... TM has bills for his lavish lifestyle
lol
Every money flow metric shows that its shedding buyers left and right, its down 6%, and 6 out of 9 of the 5 minute periods have been sell offs, larger in volume than any positive price action. What are you smoking
Everyone has been saying long GME lmao. What positions did you have
Market is up dumbass
You looking at the market? Or the "Meme" market hoss

NO HOLD THAT BITCH
Nah hold
Nah dude your good, im sure it will reverse and double in less than a month lol
Buy high, sell low
Yes. Save the bleeding!
Nah, its Tuesday 10:30am, too early to call
Stfu we had multiple 20%+ days in a row, obv it will crash occasionally. Its going to skyrocket again soon. Not dead not dead believe me

November was one of the best months of the market ever.
nobody said it wasn't lool
Everything is a pump and dump. Look at the biggest tech stocks and this has happened over and over.
Pump and dumps repeatedly come back to just under 30?
Considering we hit 33 last week, 40 didn't seem that far off.
I usually sell 45dte but premiums were so crazy that I sold a 44c December for 4.5... I really dont think people understand IV and break evens
Don't brother, wait it out
pu$$y
Why did you get in if you didn't understand the play?
didnt we already miss it though
Thats not a bad lotto ticket.
If you can get Feb or March you'll have the play cover earnings. I would personally spend a little bit more and get earnings exposure
Cant lose if you cash out your buy-in when its up 800%
How's that Robinhood's fault? You got shit on for placing a limit order lmao
the reason for the overnight jump is because of the no reason dump yesterday.
no
I guess vaccinations starting soon isn't a reason anymore.
No reason? First of the month, people making their buys for December. Everyone wants a position for 2021 which is shaping up to be the best year in market history. Nothing but good news and recovery on deck.
What in the fuck kind of DD have you done to warrant writing this?
Why? Its up 2% premarket
Feels like it. Or people cashed out for Christmas

In all honesty, they have over $12.50/ share in cash on standby so its not like the company is failingS record numbers in Q4 so far prove otherwise

Run up to dec 8th, probably pull back after earnings for Q3 and then the ride until march when the WSB army lead by ryan cohen descend on the shorts and BOD and run this stock up to $50/share
Seems like a safe play.
Just wait. No good ps5 only games out now anyway.

the first hour doesn't count
I hear le mis is pretty good
At $20 with a 3 bln market cap, seems good to me. With Nikola rightfully continuing to tank, its even more positive.

Why not sell a portion to cover and keep the rest
You paid alot for the long expiration. Youve had just a few shit days in a row and have plenty of time. Fucking hold dude. Stocks always sell off around this time of year. You'll be back up big in January.
Shut up.
Go ask mom!
patience man jeeze. give it more than 7 minutes.
MORE Act vote taking place this week. APHA down a little today but might be a good day to buy.
It's not a pump. It's a correction based on a partnership.

Literally zero chance.
Nah, no chance. Can't even hold 52 now
Not happening with the recent news.
Not today bud.. 1-3 months out id give you the nod
130
my 130 calls would cum
Easily
I was thinking the same thing last night. I'm in education and we hope to NOT use it next fall. And I imagine every other education customer is in the same boat. We paid them 10-12k. We have absolutely zero use for it next fall if rona is under control.
If it becomes super mainstream, who knows what Zoom will do to innovate and monetize more. This might be a wake up call that even when this virus stuff is behind us, we will still use Zoom because its easier and more efficient.

That bandwagon is now a radio flyer red wagon for toddlers. Enjoy bag holding
400 is more likely with the whole "we'll do whatever it takes to keep the markets up" goal.

this is an opportunity to buy more as far as i am concerned

This is less of a day trade, and more of a wait for the news trade. Once news hits, it'll jump to $20+, or fall to $10.01. Obviously $20 is the way to go.
Just hold it until the merger and stop spamming
Just fine. You?
Shut your whore mouth
God speed, brave soldier.
The market stopped caring about case counts in April bro where u been
The market doesn't care about the rona.

I have the same question
U need 25k in cash and 25k in equity
Log off then

Puts it is!
GME is a shit company, and its just a short squeeze. Good luck to you and your analysis trying to time the market, Mr. Warren Buffet
Explain and source pls
Why go against the grain when "they will short it to keep it down"? Go with the flow, short it, and buy it back cheaper = more tendies on the run up
 wendies?
No one cares about your cyber flirting, positions or ban
Good luck.
Obvious troll is obvious

Sell naked calls then.
What are you on about ? The shorts are not covered yet.
You have zero idea what youre talking about.
Stop scaremongering its going 33 today
I'd hope 10 again.

There and back again.
Yea, white power! /s 

I dont understand how this pisses you off. They have almost no representation in corporate America. 

What are you? A fucking plumber in Charlestown, WV? This rule doesnt apply to any place you work dont worry.
I'd be interested to hear why u think this is a bad idea.
I am a woman and this pisses me off. Women should EARN a seat on the board, not be handed one. Giving out board seats because of gender does nothing to help the company. I dont care if the members have a hole or a pole, I just want to make money.
Oh no! One person out of 10-20 people has to be a woman!  
This is a travesty! How dare the SJWs do this!
Lolol, can't wait until they find out how bad equality of outcome is vs equality of opportunity. 

Will blow up in everyone's faces soon enough.
You don't get it do you? Women did not have equal rights until the 70s and 80s. When a group has been opressed then they need a boost or they will never become equal with their peers.
that's retarded
Really! Why?
F

Stfu retard
Yea I hate Liz too but Im not paying for overinflated costs of education thats bullshit
Lol that's stupid. Students have been getting fucked for years and cancelling student debt is the only reasonable solution going forward. This would provide the greatest economic stimulus in the history of the **world**, and lead to an unprecedented economic boom. Imagine not being penalized for pursuing higher education, millions of people suddenly having a surplus in their income to spend stimulating the economy. If you think this is bad, you're an uninformed boomer.
  
No. Why?
Ghey
AAPL is like a crab how sideways it goes.
I bought a leap last week cause I felt like it was time after 3+ months of being flat. Did not expect to be up so much already. Looking at +80-90% at open if this holds.

Youre better off investing in some sort of vaccine for the worldwide pandemic thats ensuing...
you can have mine
looking like a decent play will probably bounce on heavy support at 440-437 range
prolly would be a good idea.
Man, the vaccine is from bntx, not pfizer! they only help in (US) Marketing and logistic
how can you be down pfizer is at ath
it's a shit company but it has had some momentum recently so take that as you will

Yah you take a bigger hit Monday morning than Tuesday morning
Only on my life span. (Also options)
And a bigger hit over a long weekend than a normal one iirc

PLTR maybe I dont even know what they do.  not NIO tho
Definitely not. If you have options, sell them. But Im holding both PLTR and NIO shares. Just be patient man, no paper hands.
No
Why would you sell your shares?! Theyre shares not options, neither are getting delisted
Yea for GME, buy the dip!
Shares? Probably not
APPARENTLY PLTR PUTS!!
What enticed u to buy them anyway?

Everyone is leveraged to the tits in calls. VIX will stay down because of that.
Sell puts.  HYLN has been a theta gang dream for me
Did you consider talking about mutual interests instead of bragging about money?
Me and my friends are all supportive of each other honestly. If my boy makes a shit load Im happy or him cause hes my boy regardless of my situation. 

Maybe you can give them some investing tips so they can also get some gains. If your friends are jealous of your success they hardly qualify as good friends assuming youre just sharing exciting news with them and not flaunting it
Yea keep your stock gains to yourself playa

BB is the future 
Yeah but if I have PLTR shares, then maybe when it turns into Skynet I'll be able to work in the extermination camps instead of just being shoveled right into the electrocution pits.

What are your calls? Or are you holding an obscene amount of money in shares?
Yes, dont think. Just follow the crowd
For some reason puts are not moving as much as calls are going down, do you know why?

This sub primarily sells stuff to bagholders once its mooned. Start selling theta to the bagholders.

Look at all the BB threads, AFTER it already mooned. WTF, IV is >200%, too late. 

Same with any other meme stonk after its mooned. 

Every now and then, you'll find a diamond in the DD, just check the posters history.
I am a happy person thank you
No, just bear talk....err Mr. Buttlicker
A green day will do that to you lmao
Taking into consideration that stocks only go up. Yes
Buy shares to make them go up
I got in just under 24 tho Im not THAT retarded
tfw I sold at 24
People keep saying this but nearly every person who was holding PLTR could have made money yesterday if they sold close to open and bought back in when it was -12%
Exactly the same thing for Chinese EVs. Fucking manipulators pos.
Facts maybe being too reactionary lol
Facts lmao. Plays youve given up on could come back from the dead a week later.
If i lose $, i lose $
Dude even stupid OTM calls from Monday-Wednesday can make money. Just be sure to sell at open.

It will still be bankrupt in a few years, but we making money on this shit for now.
Why dont you take a look at my posts and jerk off to the reason you fucking joined this sub in the first place you cuck bastard
Ive conditioned myself to never sell or buy in the first hour. I need to learn to not even look.

Stock has been overdosing on laxatives.

The stock will soon shit itself upwards aka we going to the moon.
Pltr go boom boom if it gets an initial boom
If you can't understand that, you truly are a tard and genuinely belong right here.

It will go UPPIES.
The bears offered a combined 650k shares. If PLTR goes up now, theyll still have 500k shares they need to meet, even if they have to buy at a loss

I think thats what hes saying...
Fat yellow ass gang diamond hands hold to $25

I'll just let it expire worthless at this point
Yeah I think Im gonna take that approach after Ive been getting burned the last 2 days.
AAPL went first, so MSFT will literally follow suit..

Coiling up in the dark pools overnight and now ready to run!
The level of shit they're spewing is impressive! I have no clue how they're still so far from being a pennystock.
12/24 9c
I went for 12/11 10c. About $0.50
He don't know
Where do we see the stock price by EOY?
Yes sir, I personally sold a $25 strike Put for 12/18. I'll gladly take assignment
That's exactly my point. Citron has been wrong about nearly all their shorts, and PLTR will be no different.
No bags. I sold a 12/18 Put at $25 strike. I'll gladly take assignment if it's under $25 by December 18
Hold shares if you've got them. You'll be fine.
Could go Even higher but i can bet on 30+
We have zero influence
Because were *organic*
Except NKLA
Except PLTR.
Ya Im really curious about who sat through yesterday to sell today.. hoping this is just monthly rotation and well see a more reasonable path up
Yeah but red days are good for consolidating, and all of those 3 days bottom was $24 and climbed back to $25 where its the real support
Yeah I was still a teen then. No phone for me back then.
Im selling at open most likely. Bought 130 contracts at close for like .13 a share for 40c exp 12/4. If PLTR opens at $28 or $29 I could see the price per share going to like .4 or .5.  Make a nice little extra $4k to start my day.
Im probably gonna take out my initial investment by selling a few.  They dont start expiring until 12/24 so I have time.
Earliest one expired 12/24 and they all for a few months beyond that.
That's not what yall were saying when the volume of PM sales went through the roof. Everyone has something different to say here.
Every trader hates them lol I just sleep them away
Yeah I just uninstall RH and download it come Monday morning.

Edit.

If I bet my own money, my prediction is 125 by around Christmas-time. 
My gut tells me 125 will happen within the next week and a half.

According to my calculations, Im starting production on jokes for the people that buy at 60 in 2 months

Lowkey Id love a J Pow podcast
TF is dat?
I already have $30 calls from last week 
Why wait until it's up 40% to do that though?
I'm not that far out, all my options are up or down over 20% today but they perfectly cancel each other out. Hovering between up 0.5% and down 0.5%
Theres either gonna be some really beautiful V chart recovery or some really devastating loss porn. Excited to see
you're diamond handing the wrong side of the trade bro , take profits. gme's got retard strength.
> pltr

BB puts
What do you think BB is heading towards??
jerking off is the next best thing then
I have calls as well but theyre for feb and may expirations cause Im retarded but also beat Down syndrome boiii
At least I can feel good about something today
Using PLTR shares as my bank account at this point lmaoo
Dont hold your breath on that one.
Why?
Im still holding and I know Im gonna regret it but Im doing it anyways
The one and only T H C 
  
BB i assume
his account
That is the hottest take Ive heard. And I love it.
Yeah but its weird posts about how well its doing and its shitting the bed today along with everything else
Ayyyyy lets goooooo
We back bro!!
buy tsla
Since the SnP inclusion news a couple weeks ago, TSLA price has fluctuated in a pretty consistent ~$60 range that increases daily. Thats the medium term trend. 

Today the price action started high, dipped pretty far, rebounded a bit, dipped back into a similar spot, rebounded a bit less, etc. This pattern tends to signal a breakout in the opposite direction of the price action (in this case, up). 

So the short term indicators and medium term indicators are pointing to a TSLA rally EOD/tomorrow/rest of week. The long term is that TSLA is up a billion percent this year, and its always possible people decide to take profits... but this is a good setup to buy TSLA calls
$10 End of week.
I legit scroll past the negativity and smile when I see something that confirms what I've done
Yeah.  I mean what is their plan?  Selling ps5s for Xmas?  Arent they getting rid of stores?  Maybe like videogame amazon although I already use Amazon.   Don't get the hype

Nah Boris is the fucking boy
It got a price target increase by wedbush to $49 which should be a solid catalyst for more PT by other institutions to start the rocket back up to take me and the CRSR boys to Saturn.

Why what's happening today?
Blasphemy!

Or the idiots who sell just because it didnt rocket overnight. I get were dealing with morons but my god people need to chill
What positions? Im down a grand.
Same. Least its not -100%...
Yeah, shares only. I'm from Switzerland, so finding a good broker for options isn't that easy.
Yeah it's cutting heavily into my gains. But then again, not a loss until you sell. Long-term both should be more than fine and I ain't got no paperhands.
not a good day to be me :(
And LI
WFH from a bnb so hot right now though

Im in TLRY calls and shares, shares of ACB, S-n-d-l shares and calls, and H-e-x-o shares. Last two are pennies that I think might get my comment blocked.
If you bought shares, why would you take a 2k loss?
Its not even what I said a few days ago lol but then again we love unbridled optimism here.
12/4 lol

I think SSR will kick in and it will trade sideways the rest of the day. Pretty sure thats what happened yesterday. I fucked up and held too long in September waiting on a bigger drop, and ended up holding the bag.
Post the Gain porn or gtfo. I hope you took profits today. Some are up >4,000%.

Oh Im holding!
Papa Theil is gay he will always butt fuck you
Strong wall unless they move it
Another day of drop I'll buy 10k of leaps let's go
Fair enough
My hands are folded! Im saying Im watching everything yall post and double checking it on Ameritrade and you guys are proud fucking idiots!! I love it!!!  but I dont fucking trust you... with that being said..  what are WE gonna do next?? 
Sure ill hold these giant bags of shit for another 2 or 3 years
Somebody tell them it's puff, puff, pass.

Have to think it would go down unless the deal is called off then fuked
up - its an extension which means a deal is being done. if theres no deal then why extend
This is my future
Ive learned to make a distinction between my savings and gambling/options money. Genuinely go long shares with savings, all the money ive lost has been thanks to options. Its always a very risky bet :(
Earnings play :( 
Seemed like all the IPOs were doubling in value so saw potential for SNOW
Er, literally bought a call at open (after news broke), and the contract tripled since then.
Ur making my day worse stop
Meme guy checking in
I havent been here for an extremely long time.. but it has changed. this may be the end of the empire

Yup, only reason I sold tbh was JPow was speaking

Alexa play fade out by radiohead
I aint blasting until we get to the moon 
I'm more so curious to see what they say in postnut clarity
I want to hold for the long run and i sold half of my shares at 32 so just buying back what i sold at this level
Boomers only understand mowing the lawn on Sunday at 7am. They'd sooner invest in Blockbuster and Hertz than companies such as Palantir.

Exactly, people forget entertainment and theatre type stocks are still down significantly.
Thats why im here 
SNDL
June 2021
Yeah 12/4 $9c, I think it will hit $9 before EOD
Still didnt sell my 28p
ouch.
APHA
Ok bro show me your crystal ball.
You belong here.
I swell up at just the small possibility
Thought ackman already said they werent mature enough
I got 3 of the same and some far out shots after inclusion

Im ready for my free money

PLTR BABA PLUG SR AC
Fidelity.

Selling against shares or trading prems?
I did and Im not...gonna need to see some upward movement for that
Share holders are the Steelers v Ravens game. Keep getting their satisfaction delayed 
thanks man i know how they work lol
I lost 34k on that one too!!!
I still wanna cum all over her face
Lol I didnt buy shit I sold my shares at the top, I was watching from the side lines
Actually it does because your broker buys to hedge it
Lol
UK approve within the next week, US by December 24, then Europe right around New Years
Corona isnt even real lol but buy it
If it gets UK, US, and Europe approval, I think $45 is very realistic, maybe more with how wild the markets been honestly
And this isnt a buy the dip buy the dip type play that you constantly see on here, this is a buy some calls a few weeks out and hold and take in the gains
Nah, don't turn this into partisan thing.

Dems want some shit like the protection youre suggesting.

Repubs want big corporate bailouts and other shit


Neither side will budge.


Blaming one side when 2 sides refuse to compromise is simple bias
If you require an employee to do something dangerous and they suffer damages, you should be able to be held liable. What is so controversial about that?
Yesterday
Yesterday
Idiot. Youre supposed to hold.
At the top bro?
Yes my child. What flavor do you want your Iphone 12 to be?
You right. Woulda paper hands it anyway
Yeah I buy stocks not to make money
.... well ... uhhh ... you see ...  I can give my second born a better life because of sacrificing my first born...
Im being patient but its hard to feel good when youre down 12.5% of your entire brokerage account. 
costed me $20+ just to get in and out of a damn trade. Such Bs
Lmao and the cycle continues. Whats the next meme stock to wipe out some tard accounts?
Failed big time. PLTR was literally on every single post. If this isnt evidence that we don't have market moving influence on large caps idk what is. We could definitely sway a penny stock though.
Oh its definitely FOMO.
I sold my calls early on Wednesday and took out about $1700. Then FOMOd Friday at open lol.
Come on mate, have some sympathy
I deserve that
Thanks man
Elk Grove California if anyone is familiar lol
don't glorify that fuckin bum bruh. go to mcdonalds, get a job slingin tendies, save up a year's salary and yolo it all on PLTR. there's no excuse.
You ever been hungry, dumbass?
Yeah, except it objectively sucks
bigger capital losses 
Set a limit buy at 12 even
You expect me to take responsibility for my own actions? The audacity
Im in at 11.00. I still believe in it but its very tempting to pull the plug on it
Oh I did not realize that was tomorrow ... Been caught up with Nikola puts
I've got 12/18s that I'm diamond handing, I have hope for yours bro.
For about a year but that was my first time buying options
Bought a little of both and APHA too
It might be out of gas because it went from $20 to $20.55 yesterday. That's high octane upwards movement for this stock.
No you can short as you want because you sell a shorted stock to someone else. There is nothing to stop him from lending that short to another shortseller and then he buys back his stock and does it multiple times.
They can't borrow against borrowed shares?
Definitely, but my idea was that by doing that they can create artificial selling pressure every time there's a pump
why
>Every action in the stock market is an over reaction.
100%
Its won't dude shit. They do this all the fucken time.
Delisting coming soon.
Neutered stimulus might undermine that though.
Tesla going to $800 by inclusion
I read the bill and it actually does pose some concern short term. It's a bipartisan bill that has support on both sides and probs the only thing Do Nothing Mitch will pass. The biggest concern is that there will be a ton of audits on a whole bunch of Chinese companies to see what stakes the Chinese government has

Take a look for yourself: https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/945
Theres zero chance its stripe lol why would they choose to spac when they could just snap their finger and get unlimited money
Yes lol
Cleveland gang 
I rather have snow tbh. At least i can enjoy something
I got thermals on
27 in Chicago, 2 months of winter down 5 to go
Fuck ya boiz.  I consider these leaps, so i dont know what kind of gains can materialize, but 500% or bust my dudes
Lol
Getting frosted tips
A lot more hair on the sides then the top. Haircut + beard trim + straight razor. Hot towel, waxed nose and ears. Only treat myself to this 3 or 4 times a year.
think share price will be down by eod?
Something with amazon, and its the next AMD apparently.
Yes
Fuck that, After what spy did yesterday theres not way im going spy calls this week
I didnt, it didnt fill and I was really busy with other trades
Didnt cancel, just didnt fill
12/4 $9c.... I don't see it not coming close to $10 by EOW with so much positive legalization news coming in from around the world. Thailand, UN, US, Mexico, etc...
What kind of news are we expecting? I havent been following tbh
Lol
And strap on
But what makes it occur? And does it mean anything? good? bad?
I guess that's all we can do now. Good luck soldier.
I have a limit order set at $23 but didnt think it would drop that far
CRSR has 3 double digit red days. Everyone else was buying shit at the top
Average up, bro. This thing is gonna 10x from here
This one can fuck off
The april extension has been just about guaranteed or the merger fails immediately. It should still be bullish
It does have to go up though which is the opposite of what is happening.
Buy vaccine stonk derivatives then idgaf. You like money or not?
Then kee buying GameStop and Palantir.
Its just a little gully, thats all
Leaps it is
Yes
shit you r right.
Exactly. Hate to see it but it was rough. Cant use logic or decency so this is what happens lol.
Would you take a loss on PLTR calls expiring on 12/11?
Really any! This world requires oil and gas to do anything. My personal holdings xom and cxv. Dip then call. Its really that simple. Data is there.
R u being sarcastic? Lmao idek
I sold half at 32 so just bought it back at this level. Buying at 40b market cap is a steal
No they arent
its split right now Id say
12/11 & 12/24
ATh - hedge your calls for sell-off
Funny you should say that. I have both and well..
Ru serious
Amazon deal
Yea fair enough - Id say we all need to pick and choose WHEN we decide to listen to this sub. Theres def some really smart people here with great advice; theres also a lot of YOLO hype-beasts that will talk you into losing money fast.

Just be careful yall.
I dont know if i want to hold through today though. Dont want it to dump on me
Its rallying back nicely today. It could happen but we shall see
Still a good buck if you got in and out after it came back a little. Sure would have been nice to see this at 10 am
yeah i have a gambling problem with long calls/puts i was going all in on FDs.  

i used to make decent steady money with theta strats and gonna go back to it
Stay strong lads. Itll be back once this negativity fucks off.
yeah i was a retard haha still considering a 30c 1/22 though just waiting for iv to go down
He's pretty good 
Lmaoo I feel that brother. I'm still holding my PLTR but I don't know how strong I can be if it continues dropping this week considering it's 35% of my portfolio.
$300k leveraged loans on  for me
Look at the real time Nasdaq tape bro
Fine Ill sacrifice myself for the greater good
Tesla puts I guess, I ride for the people
1000 shares at 15.79
Hablo anglais?
If it goes Back to 20 im closing everything and all in pltr
I wanted to answer yes but I dont put Tesla and nkla in same category

They are really an electric vehicle company, and considering they produce products, theyre far closer to a Tesla than a Nikolai

It needs to be said though that part of why Tesla is valued the way it is is because no matter what people want to say, both for memetic reasons, and because of his track record, the Elon musk X factor is a big part of Teslas valuation.
I don't think you can compare it to NKLA. One, Nikola is developed.hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, not EVs. Secondly, NIO actually has cars on the road. 

Not sure it is Tesla-tier though.
Nobody knows as it's chinese so you can't trust anything they say. Could be legit...could be luckin
Oh.... :(  


Well, at least tell me what the future is like.
Long term yes. Read my DD post.
Yeah. Wifes not pleased lmao.
Lol 
I don't know.  I get all my news from WSB
Trying to diversify 
Its not worth what people are paying for it tho
Options.
You need to learn when to take profits.
Thank you for your help
Youre part of the problem. Upgrade so my options print
The door is to your left
I always screw myself over not going out far enough. this time. i'm just holding some extra cash on the side and getting rid of my fun stonks
Thanks. Just checked it out. Just might be retarded enough to work
Yeah, do not forget our PLTR cousins, they were left bagholding too
Nice
Pump incoming homie
PLTRs proprietary software uses the vlookup feature in xcel no other competitors can even come close to their big data analytics prowess
Only the early ones. The ones from Friday...oof brutal
I just want to see if people actually know what they're buying instead of chasing
Good bot. IV too high imo
bro 250% IV. If you are seriously buying this you are too retarded for this. Do you know what IV crush is
When GME is trading at $69 and I've secured $420k gains your wife will be praising me.
6days a week and then need to spend sunday doing own sales so is 7days a week ard 16-18hrs/day
Time to dance like you're not long PLTR?
Honey > Tenders
Oh no, not again
Are you thinking morning spike and afternoon dip?
Not only in Russia
We dont care about west coast here, we run on real time
Nah there will be a dip after open, always is
How do you get the best price when you sell? What's your strategy?
Do none of these have merger targets? Not finding anything online after a half-assed google search.
I'm not fucking with a penny stock that was 30 cents yesterday and 80 cents today. This is how you end up holding heavy bags.
If I break even, I'm tossing everything but shares and long term calls overboard.
Id consider yourself lucky only down that much. I have a $29 that I'm down 62%.
Vroom vroom baby. PLTR will get me the lambo 
April 25C?
Well I was up to 11k and now have 2k, but only 5k of my money was lost.
See you from Mars when we hit 630 without you
Those mods though...
Brother TSLA isnt the only overvalued stock. They are all overvalued. Either the value of the asset is lying, or the value of the dollar. Its the later. Welcome to asset inflation, and the bubble! You wouldnt trade in 1999?
You know when you take a number close to zero and divide anything by it it makes it explode? Thats what happens when companies are just starting to turn a profit. Using PE to judge valuation of growth isnt a good indicator.
P/E is just a number meant to scare nerds from making money.
Got any targets? Im thinking 10-12
Whats the point? Cringe
Its crazy seeing people here still try buy puts lol or take 'profit' when this shit is likely to double in a month once Biden + Yellen + Powell + Vaccine + Stimulus occurs
i added that part
Bears r fuk
Bold of you to assume that I can afford ZM
12/4 230C. Also 200 shares.
Whatever I do is gonna be a mistake I guarantee. Might sell the 1/15/21 PFE $39 and VALE $12's but keep my $50 PFE 6/18/21's.
Debating on selling last 2 and just wait for another dip if not Im sure Bntx will dip soon
Mtfker, it better. I got until next week for $40C
Just bought 100 of them. See ya tmr dude.
just bought some. 12/18. easy money
Yeah? Fight me.
Raised guidance yesterday and upgrade came from Stifel this morning.   
Stock that keeps on giving
The question is what expiry
Hahah wtf
Lol I just looked at it holy shit! If we are retards they must be brain dead wtf
500 billions market cap where do you get this???
I'm just looking for $80-100 in the next year or so to sell my shares
Wdym? The people who frauded EV?
Thats cant be it because its affecting the entire EV market
Ive been on APHA for a few weeks now but they all should pump leading up to the vote
Youre retarded if you dont already know
I know haha. But nah when she rejected me she said if she could hire one more she would hire me. Now she said they had decided to hire one more hence I got it. Its a good company.
Yeah man hahah..thanks!
Yeah that's true, but timing is a bit convenient
Today? Mate it's had this trend for the last few days
they are shares. calm down
11/19
If you buy more now it will look better later.
No worries, the strategy is a long hold so dont be afraid of a couple red days here and there.
What's the strike. Even without knowing it, you can wait until this pushes back up, sell the option, or roll it out for a further date.
Is a joke. That would totally happen to me
All they have to do is buy calls
Lol it just got kind of quiet
but perception is all that matters here  if it can be memed, it shall be memed
Im out of capital
You'll miss out on the real gains.
I got seatbelts on mine
Bb is essentialy not the same company any more, they are doing new good shit now
I took some gains, not enough apparently
true lol
Ban
Explain?
For real
It's not my supervisor!
pretty sure other brokerages do crash unexpectedly on big volume days
not really. i remember fidelity having the most issues during the monday of the aapl/tesla stock split week.
margin 10k and sell theta on it. instant 2k retard
i do, ty bro
You are exactly right
we're so screwed :(
Because their OS can reserve a charger for you? BB bust
Do you have tesla calls?
Get more stonks now on the dip so you can buy a rocket and you can eat shit on the rocket while heading to moon
I was patiently waiting. I dont want it to meme like pltr did but the volume was way too low. Needed some exposure
blackberrys were the best tho.  what id do for a phone with a real keyboard again.  way easier to text and drive
Leaps or Shares?
Yeah. I agree. Just need to figure out a good entry target. I think it could explode but trying to keep the cost basis as low as possible.
10% over market price on a 590c
thank you for holding our bags
Date?
People are illiterate and dont understand the bill is a big nothing burger
then I'll go down with the ship.
God I hope so
Gotta be some sort of consequences to all this printing ?  Or something along the lines of Market can stay irrational ...longer than you can stay solvent ?
No bears left Im assuming
I mean its just a company thats the highest its been in 3 years on the verge of bankruptcy during a pandemic. Whos the retard here?
How on TOS?
PLTR hovered between $26/$27 all day yesterday after dumping to $24.
Why?
Youre a day late on that one pal. To the moon
Dip out beforehand
APHA loves to sell off on good news.

I'm honestly surprised it's staying above 6 after being in this stock for three years lol
I like APHA the most, great returns and has a higher buy consensus than most other weed stocks.
Pretty sure GM took him in the back door.
F
When you have all 0DTE and weeklies, you have no patience or discipline.
I am just glad that I doubted it enough to only buy shares and not the theta ticking time bomb calls some of these dillholes purchased.
Yeah. Since these autards want to actually buy something that has a 98% chance of failure, I am switching to Far OTM Theta gang and am going to sell SPY spreads to them for 0.05-0.10 every Mon Wed Fri for a 4-5% gain and will be a millionaire in a year barring any major setbacks. Fuck em.
I didn't check that when I bought but it was at like $31 when i bought puts
It's not a pump and dump but people are insane thinking it's gonna hit $20 EOW or whatever.
yeah, i'm in with 100 shares. WSB needs to learn.
Im still bag holding so I hope not. Haha
no quite my dude... Sept high was $134... we're at $123
Definitely the way

I'm currently winning  sold all my calls when it hit 31 or 32, loaded up on them again when it hit 25.
TLDR; it'd all speculation below.


I did and I didn't buy in.

GME hasn't given me the right numbers yet to get involved in for the hopes and dreams of a short squeeze.

And I don't think the catalyst is there yet for that to happen and I don't want to tie up and funds on them.

Maybe ill look at it again in February. Maybe my spidey senses will go off then and I'll buy in before they release some news about how they're going to pivot the business model.
I'll take 200 stocks of CMG please.
Stifel Nicolaus - to 44 from 32.
brrrrrrr 
Good bye  
Lol...okay.

yeah you right
So 10.79 USD
Cramer is right all the fuckin time? Not to mention you can follow his boomer plays way easier than WSB meme mania 

Nobody bats 1.000
Works for me. I'd way sooner chase boomers into apple and boeing than retards into PLTR with IV > 200
I'm thinking another straight vertical rise from all the idiots that have a buy order sitting for open and then the subsequent crash as all the limit sells get hit at the top.
Fuck off, retard.
I needed this comment. Had the stupid thought of taking my 8% profit this morning. 

HOLD
I gotta level up first

I hedged my bets. I win either way
I'm talking more about going from 240 to 360 in 9 months.
yep twins
Why?
All leaps
Is that literally it? Damn
Not very
Its going down today and tomorrow and Thursday its going to tank completely Mark my words.
Holy fuck boyyyyy
Fair play to you! I've made some nice change off SPY calls last month but I thought the recent price action called for a 2-3% dip in the short term. Clearly I was wrong.
This
Like 130c 12/11
569.420
What I learned it the I guess that sold shares at 25. Those are almost all got up this might stsrt running soon.
Banks are up like 20% for November.  

RKT is in it's own little retarded trading range
Had to watch a week of TSLA momentum from the sidelines 
I want whatever youre on lol
*psth
No price target. Just going to ride the up and keep rolling my calls

Definitely but I was hoping for a lower price
Offering 51.9 million shares so theyll raise about 2.5B at $50

EDIT: I believe they were aiming for 30-33B market cap
I believe they were aiming for 30-33B
selling your puts or calls?
Price target??
Ye I have some 03/21 but I hate buying shit when it's already up 2% premarket
Bloomberg News
Okay Ill buy in at 16,000
Thats not a bad thought
Yeah, Im between breville and the DeLonghi. Seems like Breville has a slight edge.
Do you like it as much as the rest of the team here? Anything you dont like or wish it had?
Does the screen provide you with more feedback?
Color blind gang 
true
Its been ignored for too long. Dats why
Tis.
Is it the record holder
yup
Bought the call yesterday thinking I was at the dip buying at 585$. Then came 565....
Like anybody here thinks that far ahead.
Not really but ok
I see possibility in that
32c for same date, Im holding
Why do I always regret not selling at pre market lol smh PLTR
i accidentally bought another call when buying puts so now i'm good no matter what  


Whatever you do, don't throw more money at it
Biggest mistake selling now - it will go back up
12/11 calls
What makes you say that man
Oh I did and I regret it 
this is the way
Yea I know but only my positions are tanking so that means it must be market wide cus Im smart
Oh I bought dont worry. We are about to get squeezed into space
At this point Id rather get hit by a car
Well I'm not denying it has ton of room to grow, just not today. More than 10% movement in 1 day is rare, even for a meme stock
Probably. It's actually beating the earnings, unlike PLTR...
I dont know, i just couldnt stomach it. I exited at a loss.
Very true lol
Whats the deal with ppl making fun of Jeffrey Epstein name?

Merger with the largest Microsoft 365 data management company seems somewhat promising no?
You think it will hit $9 eod?
I was promised 135 by EOD tho!
Hold on to your hats and if you bought hold em hold until 12/3.
Hold the line. Its American.
thats called a bull trap
It follows the exact same pattern every day. Always a good dip around 1030 EST.
Both are solid but I pick xpeng if I have to pick one!
Ya I bought the dip yesterday and got fucked
Im boutta bust your block
Or hold to recover the position assuming theyre dated long enough
Yah I think the figure of 20% unemployment on low income is really telling here. Its completely masked by the market.

...which unfortunately May be by design.
I was long yesterday ...exited at high this morning ..want to buy now
Not til after the 21st boi
44-50$
Ye
Planning on it
Good to know. Do you think nows the time to get out of NIO? I'd end up breaking even.
100% agree, but consumers still going to spend money they dont have and then donate money on Facebook for the positive energy of Facebook likes
Not shares and yes kidding about rope.
Exactly
14.5 and 16.5c 12/31

It has promise to hit $20 EOY, but if you wanna be more conservative I would go for April 2021
yeah same, kicking myself for not pulling the trigger yesterday
my 10c might be itm by eod, wild
yea i'm  looking to do that next step here shortly.
Log in and give me your money bruh
I cant afford that
Can you explain logic behind that
Felt this in my soul.
Haha, who said I would want to fly other people?
Im upset honestly Bc I sold 4 6.5c for $16 yesterday. Worth about a grand right now
Im also wondering where the motherfuckers that threw just even 2-500 into it are at
Not saying rich and well connected people but complete fucking losers from high school that actually work at Wendys are making money rn off of no research/intelligent thought at all and think theyre the shit because of it
Lol. I was on the verge of selling out.
Yeah, I rode it up to $12 a few years ago and got out for good.
It's fine for short term.
It's 300% and it's funner that way.
FAHK

Overnight youll get flagged as PDT which youll need to ask to lift tmrw. Im working through TD rn. Then, let your funds settle 2-3 days and dont break PDT rules until youre 25k+
Spicy hot fire flames take!  Certainly not impossible though...
Yeah but all of this hype is based around the covid effects being short-lived. If it turns out that covid is here to stay for 2021, and none of the vaccines get approved, then you can bet your bottom dollar that spy is drilling down perhaps even as low as $2021.
Its called a review. And the FDA are reviewing the vaccine results. Because any company can claim 95% success rate but if their data and results are flawed then the approval wont happen. Of course approval is more likely than not, but there is still a 10% chance they say no
lucky duck
$10.90 gang, buying more today.
gut feeling
Switches were sold out everywhere even Q3. That should at least help them. But low expectations welcome surprise. Plus, forward guidance will be incredible - looking at earnings of $5.50/share in Q4 alone.
it will
yup
guys
Hes not right, he just tweeted a self fulfilling prophecy similar to when Elon said the share price was too high. People just follow whatever one man says.
12/4 $28c will either day trade or sell at open tomorrow.
Legit no idea but up 400% today, I got in a little late but still up 48%
Its a medical company producing a preventative CoVID drug. They just announced some level of efficacy.
Im amazed too, especially because that market opening free fall made me sooooo rock hard
Not necessarily a bad bed now but no expert.  Hope it works out for you.  Nkla is the definition of retarded strength seems like.
Lol. I wish I had that kind of cash. Just credit spreads below or at $3100 strike about 3 weeks out. Usually around $225 credit on $500 collateral, then load up and wait. Ive got some expiring every week until the 25th.
lmao you are on WSB, what u think  
 But i sell when its red
Another method is to look at which stocks are actually green as the sector/market is red. When the market/sector bounces, it'll usually go up even more.
true but its green and following QQQ at least
What's yours? I know if I buy these they'll go down
they actually just cut off my whole dong
Guess its time

1/15 700c here  
That sucks.  Always the damn way.
PLTR 12/4 35c
This but also people have no practical understanding of how vaccines work. Its not an overnight "hey lets open up". Its going to take a long ass time and its going to be a methodical process that needs incredible support and diligence. If we send people back to the office or remove restrictions asap we are just shooting ourselves in the foot.
i hope your ass right
At this point is it profit taking or loss cutting?
dammit okay, let me stop checking this shit then
Thats why I have $$ today
RIOT has been on my UOA scanner the past couple of days. Good looks

Sounds like AAPL is entering Microsoft's world. Bearish for MSFT, Bullish AF for AAPL. Their first customer is a behemoth - others will follow suit.

AAPL $135 EOW
Looks bullish 
Thats when u know its starting again

Im always a day too early on my spy puts 
Yeah Im getting double penetrated by theta gang in both gme and PLTR
It is, I took calls into July just to keep the money printer going.
EOD*
Hey cockbreath its down 14% from the high these mouth breathers hyped it at. Thats not just red thats BLOOD RED
Go fuck yourself u autistic dumbfuck
I averaged down yesterday.

Might do it once more today and then I'm done lol
Yeah Im good now. I read my old comments and reminded myself I just have to believe and be a part of history.
calls, anytime after nio day
Nope prob a distant cousin
Yeah I learned a valuable lesson w GME: dont listen to the retards on this sub, inverse what they say instead. At this point Im just thankful I didnt listen to the PLTR shit lol
what the fuck are shares?
So my 27 and 28 fds are fucked
You really think it's going down much more?  25 seems to have a lot of support. Kind of worried to be honest
work $5 an hour amazon warehouse job of course.
They all pretty much admitted they made sure the market was fine. And will always be there for it. Now theyre just arguing whether they care about everything else. Which is all about getting re-elected
Buy low sell high.
Meh, not gay to protect your money when shit is looking weird. Feels like we're getting set up for something and if we were going to break 366, we have done so by now
If I dont see improvement this week I am cutting my loses and getting back into safe money
Yep thats why Im in Tesla and Apple currently. I was in Ford and Fiat Chrysler for some nice returns but again, 
So your analysis says Its either gonna go up, down, or sideways?
6 months or bust
100 Shares baby boy
 how much? Will you take $hitcoin?
 
I don't know a decent website that will tell me an updated number. 

https://www.highshortinterest.com/

This says 137%, but I don't know when it was last updated.
Link me the site you use for updated short interest, so I can book mark it.
Yeah not a bad idea.  Either way tho, if you bought at $32-$33, just hang on to that shit as youll be reaping the massive rewards by next fall.  I lost $800 in 8 hours selling and re-buying.  I knew this was a bad idea but the hype got to me.  Im in at $27 rn and gonna hold.  May not go up like it did over the first 60 days, but its goin sky high either way.  Maybe even $350-$500 over next 6-12 months.  Im actually making plans atm to put more into it.  As much as Im willing to lose I guess.  Just like the casino for me.....  I take what Im willing to lose, it might be upsetting when I lose it.......  but I aint gotta swallow a bullet if thats the case and if it goes sky high....  I think back about how its just my fun money either way and Im having a fucking blast learning what works and what doesnt.  Gut instinct is my biggest downfall.  I buy shit even though it goes against my trends and every time I get burned.  My trend is showing $22-$23 on the low end for pltr and so Im gonna hole and wait for ONCE.
Thank you for your service.
What did they give as reason? Being too humourous?
Thanks! Someone has to!
Yup! If your smart you buy in the afternoon/ first thing in the morning, sell around 1015 and jump right back in in the afternoon. Money printer.
It'll hit 19 but maintain 18 by EOD
we win as a team, we lose as a team, but mostly lose
no u stop 

we r just holding on to a little hope.. of not getting wiped :(
Why don't you just buy something else for now and avoid the current slaughter of PLTR? You can always hop back in
Should have known better than to play earnings... Especially after that flir fiasco
APHA
This is the way
Should've held since last year but it was a n'er do well stock
Yes I bought that dip lol
I've been bag holding even more. I'm taking profits as soon as I can.
CNBC has started talking about ***coin again. New ATH is on the menu now
Cocaine is the gentlemans stock
Confirmed
No APHA, and house vote is on Wednesday. If I end up having to hold then it might as well be a good stock!
But that was yesterday's news
That's what I'm doing right now. The trend is wsb. We know everything.
No. But IV will go down so calls will be cheaper.
Real tendies
Cool bruh. I see you're a fundamental analyst 
Are you though?   If you bought in on Fridays lows you'd be up well over 100% on any RIOT options which I did...
Vaxxx news are overdue!
bought at 17
I think I saw something about Milton and strategic investors just agreeing to extend it like 5 minutes ago but cant find it anymore
Bear meal?
Anon Danger Retard...seems fitting
Its gonna crash with shitty garbage coin

It already came down .75; lmaoooo I wish we could short during premarket!
If he sells all his shares between 15-20 dollars a piece he'll make over a billion. No way he doesn't dump them all out of spite for being forced out of the CEO position.

Alright, not doubting anymore. I'm in

They were deep af too. I almost took the bait with all the pictures of lambos n shit
Kinda crazy tho
Covered calls?
LIES
Merging with Skillz Inc. they provide an underlying AI powered eSports competition platform for online/mobile games that has been able to maximize user engagement and monetization. They have built a pretty robust system and are mainly making their revenues through old divorced men and women that have nothing better to do. The good thing about Skillz is that they have the capability to scale that platform up to meet new gaming demands. The eSports and mobile gaming market is set to expand rapidly up to 2025 and beyond.
SkillZ
We could send this bitch to the moon
it totally exists. may not work, but its real
Maybe its because he represents reality to the market. Even when he tries to be dovish. We definitely need Yellen.

Cant fine that ticker on RH
Blackberry It seems.
i did too, but i bought back in haha
I DON'T HAVE THE MONIES
Kind of think so too. Might buy shares for when platform rolls out
BB partnering with Amazon. Announced an hour ago
Yes
fuck you bro, I'm going to complain to my mom abt your bullying

ps- this actually makes total sense 
this. exactly.
Why the 18th?
idk
Literally has done the same thing for a week and a half. Wasnt hard to see ... fuckboy lmao
Yes there is that aspect, which I'm happy to live with if it gets me a few grand above my break even for the year lmao
*MNUCHIN TO SPEAK TO NANCY PELOSI ABOUT COVID RELIEF TODAY: NBC

You were right lol
Of course bartering with PHYSICAL gold is dumb, transacting in gold is not, Gold held with a 3rd party custodian can easily be used to transact in. The ad also says that gold has no properties of value which obvs isnt true
Oof is fuckin right lol
No idea.  These weed stocks are always a rollercoaster ride. Constant pumping and dumping.
Sold at 60 cents.. yikes
Yeah still waiting lol square is a disappointment
Good to know, but not sure what the price action over the past month is about...
Yes. But waking up to a hulk cock of +4% then ending on +9% was nice. Im not saying dump everything, but im saying come on bro.
options :( calls :(((((
telos is the new PLTR so i'm moving my remains over there
way oversold
Oof, got mine at $0.20 last Monday or so, they almost hit $6 on Friday and sold for $1.20 today 
I don't think there's any saving me now. When I inevitably go broke I'll at least remember someone tried their best to stop me haha.
I've been in calls for about two weeks. Up 180% in some of them.

Also up to the tits FCX

Long and balls deep
Good lesson on how not to follow fomo
AAPL fomo is insanity the past two days
Let it  I say, if it wasnt risky there wouldnt be big return potential in it
Yes Im sure it had nothing to do with the fact that it ran up over 160% in a month
No idea. Theyre all held in RH
Tesla mainly wouldve had 46k if I held my original positions
ill start my position small today see where tomorrow goes
Thanks for the response my G
Boomer
I have non idea it just keeps getting slapped away at 42
I see it taking a few boomer apple customers due to nostalgia (nokia bricks) however i know alot of people who don't like apple. My wife was a hard core apple fan. I put her on my plan (sprint at the time) and she used my phone and loved the fact that she could get 3rd party software. Or she could use kodi on her phone. Android takes a whole to get used to but has many better qualities than Apple imo
5g most likely, however i see nokia in the next year making a pivotal turn to try to compete with Samsung.
Adding onto my comment nokia is a 5g, phone, and tv play, all it takes is for management to make a few deals. Also nokia is literally going to the moon. Yeah it has a large float but if it stays this price for the next year I'll just add to a position.
Hips and nips baby. Father crickets gotta eat. Hips and nips.
GME guy
Yeah, not going to argue the stock isn't volatile. I'm long on stocks not options for this reason. The premiums right now are insane, but that's largely because of how much people expect the price to rocket after what will be a series of major, and first-in-line approvals.

I bought it at 19.90, got a nice profit. Im not gonna gamble and wait to see if it goes back to 50.
I bought it at 19.90 so Im not stressing lol
My favorite part of that meme is so many believed it would actually happen. 
50% of my portfolio is in intel at avg $50.77... Last earnings was bad with that -10% decrease in their data center revenue... I will sell but I don't know where to put my money on, maybe more RKT shares...

You're not wrong pal, lesson learned
Hahaha, youre absolutely right. I'm just being bitter today.
Borrow from your moms, you mooks!
APHA and spy puts. Im dumber than those Palantards
All tomorrow news will be about the vote; if you can time peak go for it. Dump the following day Id say
same lol
BROTHER!   
If the foods warm Im eating
Because have you not seen the car? They literally did a video showing its better than a r8

Take note of what a 600c costs now and watch it rise. Sorry if you dont understand the game.
saw the vix spiking so I was like fuck it

Change my mind. BABA not included
I did two today one of them I made 150$ in like 5 seconds the second one I gave it all back 
Sales scheduled for an equity at a certain price
Are you one of them?
Whyd you do that.
It was 86 two days ago. Its good enough for my autist ass.
MSOS, MJ, YOLO 
Naa. QC0M, m@rvell, skyw0rks, tsm, nxp!, er!c etc.
Qc0m looks like it's breaking out and already limit sold for 200% costs this morning so holding weeklies. Never touched broadcom nor any Chinese ones.

Can't believe OP of m@rvell DD bailed. Smfh.
she is also on wsb
Mkay but I think this will not really be an issue since in China they build factories faster than anywhere. So buy the dip I guess...
Smart lad
I'm that chump that just sold PLTR at a very minimal loss, before I lose more. Least GME is holding its ground.
Looks like a decent chance! Maybe sell half if we have a runup to avoid a potential sell the news. I just have a small two month call position, wish I could add more, but it's all tied up.
Time to take it to $20
[shorts doubled down yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1333491514559836160)
Hope so, mine are up 220%

down from being up 238% at open lol
Ahhh thanks. Still annoying
meh, has worked out just fine with other tickers 
That's what this morning was
Yes. Thats Desktop Metals next week
~15% is a lot. I could be wrong. It's close to being over IMO.
true but there are all the big votes for legalization soon.
Thanks
for some reason people think a 4x earnings like the last one will happen every earnings...which is dumb
The fuck
precisely
Im also climbing my way out from TSLA losses too. $2k up, another $1.5k to go haha.
I was thinking $250 puts
we making gainzzzzz
IWM broke out of a pattern recently that I'm starting to believe it will re-enter go to the bottom of ~162ish if shit hits the fan.  Some 175/180p for 12/18 aren't too bad.  I've also got some short dated QQQ put debit spreads 290/275, they are cheap and usually when it drops it drops fast.
if it was we'd keep going up, you should be more worried that everything seems so great
That was this morning
Tendies by Friday.
Not actually the worst idea, Ackmans latest bet comes to mind. Although in as far out target, 4/12 is a bit too optimistic. Perhaps 11/12. What do you think?
They won't. That 908B will just end up in market, they know that. They want the direct payments to poor people and more money for local aide.
You exit your GME position after making a day or two of gains but are still bagholding PLTR?  No wonder everybody is broke around here.
Typical. They talked a lot about making moves and I expected them to show up at the opening. I shouldve known - the only opening these stoners show up for is a bag of potato chips.
And also with you
440c 01/08 

Pretty much the closer ITM and farther out the better, whatever you can afford tbh.
ah so you must be up quite a bit. I got in yesterday on Feb 20c's and decided to average down
Was there more stimmy news? Been jacking off all day and havent looked at news.
The worst
Stock dropped and made some quick buck
You hold and sell call against them.
Dear place of business if you are reading this please note I do not consent or condone the use of the R-word.
Damn no hedges allowed then I guess
yep i ruined it just like my life
Ill hold with you then
Tomorrow or Thursday
https://www.investopedia.com/whole-earth-brands-tests-resistance-5089447
Yup, super manipulated so it could get that beautiful short squeeze if buyers pile on too fast.
I think citron behind it
Intra day
My APHA calls are screwing me too, but I have leaps and am still up so Im staying in the pocket
Puts not doing great either...

Yet.
I didnt wanna yolo too much lol
Stocks only go up
Ill be real with you. I have no fucking idea what that is.
Yep. Definitely the first time Ive fell for FOMO in a hot minute. Avg buy price for me is $26.50. Now awful, definitely could beat it in a few months, but short term it was stupid
Ive ran into my fair share of 17-19 year olds here. But yeah Id like to at least hope that most people are in college. May be overly wishful
She has been useless since her death I agree

Good bot.
Is that a good GG or a bad one
Palantir...on a rocket ship
Let's get it retards
I hope you're right.  I bought 12/11 30c Friday @ open.  Down like 70% and holding.
I like PLTR but GME is also hot
Lord Elon about to deliver the tendies
A lot, a fkn lot
Sure do

It's lonely at the bottom.
I'm just relaying info. Take a chill pill.
In February dummy
Oh I am!
Because why would you sell for a 50% loss unless you're just broke and desperately need that money right now?
Because they're going to sell and do the same paper hands shit with anything else they touch and lose all their money. You can't fucking time it and selling it now is literally the opposite of timing it.
I was only in PLTR spreads which are STILL itm, so you can go fuck yourself.
it's all opinion, it's not illegal to have an opinion on material public information.
damn thanks, i did mean 130
60% here.  Holding strong.  MMs have considerable stake in keeping the price depressed.  Its gonna be a battle of attrition.  

Theyre not gonna roll over and hand us tendies, were gonna need pry them from their grasp with our diamond hands.
I literally bought 25 shares
go with the hot roller
[deleted]
You think its too late for calls on APHA?
Yeah boi we gonna squeeze the shit out of these shorts hop in
THIS
I was being sarcastic
Lots of people are saying...
FOMO buying the rumor. I hear they I might have another event this year that is soon to be announced. Also, their M1 chip hasnt gotten the action it deserves yet. With a cycle back into tech, I expect all the big boys to test ATHs leading up to New Years.
I dont get humans
  
As I explained to your girlfriend's boyfriend, we don't have options in my country, so I can neither make $100k overnight nor lose my life's savings.
Yes, I was too quick to judge. It now merely indicates, it has to hold as well.
Do you have an idea about your next step or career direction?
GI Bill? You have my respect :)

You'll be fine, no worries about you!
i can't wait to find out myself!
No
No

Being against this rule doesnt mean your against its purpose to increase women and minorities necessarily. I wouldnt mind if the boards were all women and minorities. Just making it a rule is going to put a lot of people who dont deserve it there. Its the wrong way to go about it.
Of course there are qualified women or minorities... I just dont think an exchange should require a company to have a specified board
Its called diversity retard. Political gains because... fuck efficiency and everything else important
But think about the kids though!
why? I've heard some excitement here but don't know much about the company/product.

I don't care if the market is red today as long as NKLA is redder.

This is correct
You could have bought $30 puts dated this week for under a dollar at the $37 peak. 1000 of them and you'd be a millionaire today.
What? You can google it yourself...
Indeed
Nice job! 

I only had 320 (2000x0.16) in 16$ calls for 12/16 and they came back from the dead to double the price. Might get back my initial investment and let the rest run till strike.
CPRX.

Nothing crazy.
12/11, I try to stay away from weeklies because I dont trust my decisions
I did a little bit of dd and bought in. Thanks homie.. here's to hoping 
I didnt know about this. Interesting.
Yes but both trailing means that there is a lot of hedging and if you were here on march and in June/September when that other drop happened - both indices were trailing each other for ATH and then we had a huge drop perhaps a day or two after. So it might not be a drop today but I would expect a steep drop in the next few days after hitting ATH.
I went for $28c next Friday

Just 1 for now might add a few but probably just a random lotto
Pump this shit back up please - Pepe wants tendies - I cash anything green from now on. Fucking bag holder shitting the bed
That's the right move. Ride it all the way down
I told you bro.

Currently up 55%.
Up 95% rn
785 here  . Got 100 of them at $20, 55 at $28...... and the rest at $31 
I have no idea but if it does my calls are fucked
Buying at open rip
It's not a meme when they're closest to L5 autonomy
Damn thats a good one- Ill have to look at that
yessir
So basically if I bought a more expensive call I would have made money?
My gambling account has a serious stock problem
Yeah I went March for 10
yes, people want innovation not profits.
After the rest of the world gets to pile in, prolly up.

You mean the fade meant to shake you out of your position. This does not mean you are gay, this means you are a victim of stock market mind games :-)
2 hours ago it was up 1.40, me thinks its fading
Hes an idiot
Contract cost go down.

Buy.

Watch go up.

Sell.

Profit.
I usually buy shares, managed to sell GME the day before that retarded 40% pump lol
I agree. Honestly I think it will break 20k today but not sure if it will hold. Needs to hold around 20,500 and then have news outlets start hyping it and get back on the bandwagon like in 2017 and ride out that money train before tanks again

There's a vote in the American Congress to delist Chinese stocks if they don't agree to certain auditing rules. AFAIK, major companies (i.e. the Chinese EV trinity) have said that they would agree to such rules already.

Lordy lord!

Dont think that type of move is happening again for FSLY; TikTok loss pretty much priced in and theyre doing ok without them now.
BAH BAH BAH BIRD BIRD BIRD
The bird bird bird bird is the word
Shhhh the algorithms
Is that really 100 lol
Fudge...  170 new resistance maybe
Till an hour until open, get pumped
Markets open
Even bears?? No way!!
Not the cost of the steel directly but there is correlation as US steel is a steel producer. Cost of material rises- cost of doing business rises.
idk it might run up even more. could double your tendies.
This is what I was wondering.  Sounds intrusive.
It happens to the best of us, you think, THIS TIME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT.
God Im retarded.
this guy got it right
Fuck
at open obviously lol
Moves like what? 
Rule number 1 is no fomo
Did get up to 35 at one point. I was more than happy to load up on shares yesterday though
Trading worse than KO
To me that means short Amazon
Yeah right dude, this is WSB. They are weeklies.

worried it might have gone up enougu alreqdy, might be a scalp
I think it's overvalued too but it'll probably pump to $100 billion.
Honestly, we should just pump it for the dope ticker.
Ur right, I'm using my brain too much.
Its only about 200$ I laugh at a loss that small. But Im relying on people who havent been paying attention to the deal at all to pump it after CRM earnings
Thanks
Definitely going to be wild swings. Just wondering if itll be one of those stocks like Apple where youre kicking yourself at 40 years old for not buying a lot of it when you could.
Well shit cus Im PLUGged in
Yeah so a good idea would be puts on crm or work calls till 30B right? or is this too obvious?
Godspeed
This is WSB so yes. 
160c 12/18

Yup nobody knows shit including you, nerd. Hopitalizations at all-time high, more people getting together for holidays, and no widespread vaccine available for at least months. LOL if you really think another stimulus is happening
Every time i buy thicc b I always buy the top and sell the dip. This is the whey
I'm pretty sure it is code from that Q fellow.
Yessir
tfw got in at ATH
tfw got in at ATH again
His Caps lock button
Earnings are reported after market closes tonight lol
GME
That's fucking old news already
I grabbed 27c 15 minutes ago, way cheaper now lol
\^\^
Positions?
Yessir it does. The disconnect of Fang and MSFT is confusing me rn
Ill take one tendies pls
I think I'll wait to see how far it drills. If it gets under 260 I'll probably pick up something like $290c for 12/18
I'm selling at $20 cad minimum
Live right now.
Hope it prints dawg
7:30
yes I believe you're right. :-/
It hasnt been meme in like 2 months
Why do you mean?
Waste of cash? No one even knows how theyll pay for it but cash is almost never how its done.
Yup gonna ride it out a little hoping to get in around 119-120 for $1700 worth. If it drops below 117 again  I'll jump in.
same ;)
I guess, idk its just strange to me when weve seen it can hit 50 so why sell during its recovery and hurt yourself
Plenty of room to run still
Agreed, but they were so cheap when I bought it, so it was worth the gamble
640 
FR lmao, Im not gonna break up with them but damn if i am not suffering
Buy it, it will rise EOW or next week (merger announcementssssssssssss) Lets go!
Can you explain? IV is higher on the calls side or something?
It's beat earnings the last three quarters, buying calls a month out from earnings
What are your positions big boy
Sure it could dip again tomorrow, i'm just hoping it can gap up to 27-28 again between now and tomorrow market opening so i can do a swing trade since it's being so volatile
5 minutes of remarks, first 3 or just dick sucking
AAPL was 137 in september
I have a $9c 12/11 and $10c 7/16/2021
I dont doubt you. Ive already cashed out most of my puts
What are your thoughts on bb
LMAO ayeee same exact plays here, my whole portfolio. 
2/3 TSM calls 1/3 ASML calls, about 40k
I'm in the west coast
Ill drink coffee at 2 pl
After a 5% red day...yes
Baba has no reason to drop. Believe in Jack Ma.
Good luck bro, my limit order sale triggered, was so annoyed I wasn't paying attention. Bought back again but at a loss. What price u think it will hit eow?
Tell that to the mods
I do not own it, but have positions in CRSP, NVTA, and EDIT. Should have got into BEAM back in the 20s. Oh well fuck me.
1/3 of my account in it
Mad lame, wish I was an insider
Ha ya I totally restarted everything too, so fucking annoying.
Just a solid fucking play. Up 100% on Jan options
No idea I've had this march expiry for a few months now and it's been immune to theta decay so I kept it
I just realized i bought 130 instead of 135
I am thinking of this one for sure. That and a few others but everything else seems like garbage. Like zoom isnt anything. Webex has existed for years. Anyway rant over.
Yeah, Im only in LCTX and BIIB now. Im up 11% with LCTX and 1% with BIIB.
One of the most important lessons to learn.
I'm learning that lesson now. So another run up before the vote is unlikely?
yes sir
12/11 expiry, going to test the waters next week
I trusted you
I dont know what ZM youre looking at, but its down 13%.
Blackberrys stock is on track for its best session in 17 years
Not a 1:1 analogy - a lot of EV companies propped up on popsicles - I dont believe NIO is one of them - 4 months all time high in a row of vehicle output
Idk man if a major bank upgrades it...

Morgan stanley already had a $40 something target
NO REFRIGERATION NEEDED!! did you hear that algos!!
Only issue is it would take until 2022 to get delivered.
I guess this just means cheap puts. Everytime FB has a big jump like this it always pulls back.
Weirdly not.

Earnings are tomorrow 

And my slightly further dated ones are only down 1%
But earnings will probably be negative, why do you think a company that did so bad will magically have good earnings?
All of my losses are from market manipulators... all my gains from my big brain.
But not in my account full of UVXY positions
User name checks out. Im in
Theyre super cheap compared to other hot tech companies at 13x sales and their business is only going to improve with covid waning. I think its a strong buy
While one suffers the other prospers. Its the natural cycle of the WSB shithead. 

Happy for you.
Holding 200 shares @ 20.7
IDK, been following the BB story for a few years and I've seen a steady progression towards this.

Not that i had any idea this AMZN contract was coming, but I was not one bit surprised to see and am glad to hear their turnaround is working out.
Strike?
12/11
Ok first I though you were just into this idea. Just realized LUV is southwest lol
I do
You talked me into it . Gonna buy some 380s for eoy
They are the future of medicine. I can see them being massive in a few years time. What they do is just incredible.
QQQ
Well here we go again.
I know Im retart
>They? Whose they
Probably more than a few of us on this train. Its okay I will sell them back tomorrow.
Yeah Im thinking another 10 percent drop tomorrow. Buying my puts eod
Don't think so this time.  Too much money sloshing around looking for something to buy.

means stonk is stuck below 11
To break 11 1.5 million would need to be bought up
What time?
Apparently yolo is a stock..... weed etf...
yeah thats not SQ reasonable sorry
thats not what tdoc does so idk how to respond
In hell maybe
THC
You're just pissed you sold out yesterday 
Yep you saying this made me go all in on some 12/11 92C, thanks for helping me lose money
And pay tax, phuc you.
Its red pre market maybe it bleeds up all day and blesses us with sweet gains
Is there a way to look back at previous comments?
Bullshit I made like 2 or 3 comments about it you fuckin dork
Never thought BlackBerry would be relevant again is what I posted 5 days ago you dick lickin bitch
 I'm not enjoying this
:: moonwalk ::  in my gains today Chief. 
So far higher highs with heavy heavy volume, does not look like we are slowing down
They call themselves socialist, I never implied they're communists
Good enough for me, puts it is.
Puts then? Glad I asked was thinking of sticking my neck out
Damn puts was the call on Grwg anyway. Green market is shook!
So competition is real and tech is overpriced at this point.
oh I use robinhood. I also drink instant coffee most days. Much easier than setting up and cleaning the coffee maker every morning.
literally any call AAPL gives no fucks.  Buy atm weeklies, monthly's whatever, to your "personal risk tolerance"
It wont
What? How is that a downgrade
Hopefully get to post some gain porn here man... been my dream since I was a child
ive been thinking about this a lot and most people say they need to switch to e-commerce when its said that they have no future but im not sure if that will even help with how popular downloads are. i struggle to see Gamestops edge long term. Regardless i have 90% of my money in calls and shares
basically a boomer stock at this point anyway
Why would it drop though?
Its a never ending battle. I held on my pton calls when it went ath hoping it would go higher, then it crashed and lost it all.
.88 and it will be over 1 soon
Tell that to my ex wife
His breakeven is 125
Yeah.  Sell that while you're up and pick something closer
No thanks, Im not into gay sex
Lol youre a bear your opinion is nothing to me. Go lose some more money on NIO puts please
I checked. Youre right. No one selling at that price.
Me too. Always a fun day when that happens haha
Oh shit was it from pltr/nio? Also any tips?
How?
This is great motivation but can kill me quick too by being greedy haha
Nice, what did you do that on?
Lol no. Tesla will be 8th biggest in the index. They aint bumping freaking amazon out. Theyll drop some dinky stock like Ford.
I mean, idk. Im just saying dont BUY S&P stuff for the next few weeks. Im not telling you to be a gay bear. Risk doesnt equal certainty.
What is sex ?
Think you should be okay. Calls before 12/18 are a little risky atm. You got 4 weeks for PLTR to announce some good news and for shorters to find a new toy.
Buy. The. Dip.
Update: thank you, good sir
They always are lmao. Will never understand how people boast about being on the sidelines in this market
I was balls deep in PLTR and BABA but i sold at the right time. Still hold some Shroom stock.

I bought shares cuz I couldnt handle options
I would normally just strictly listen to the advice of wsb but listening to the advice of less unorthodox investors doesnt seem to be helping either
https://fintel.io/ss/us/nio
I sold earlier today at +20%, could have had +100%
When everyone is buying youd know were at the top
but also sq. it doesnt like me today
im just exaggerating haha sorry

**WE ARE THE BUBBLE**
69...420
Ironically, I actually invested in them already
I didn't say what it said so it's okay.
I think you're right.
yea pretty much
just more shares for me
I'm in for 50k but I'm not leveraged so it's ok but I'm with you I'm riding this thing till the end

Valhalla isn't the answer this time though the moon is coming just be patient
the realized loss can offset the income right? like +5k can offset the -5k?
Lol at "send that to your accountant"
No
"Sir, want us to add health insurance to your benefits?" - "Nah brah, never had any major surgery or disease. Why the fuck would I want that?"
JAGX
Blasphemy!
I never said it would never go anywhere, but stop expecting 20% days right now. I have leaps on PLTR too, but the rocket is taking a break
lookin more certain each day
Your life is overvalued
I bought PLTR at the top yesterday and literally sold at the bottom so yea I guess being a fucking retard runs in the family
The dude has always been a gambler but on those casino machines and he was always a winner. If i tell him about you autists i'd give it a week til he's sleeping in his car and messaging me at 3am with "HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS PRPL COMPANY"
Well yeah, I own the shares? Was tryna figure out if I should hold or sell off
Buying all these in a Roth account my dude, not worried about tax implications
~15%
I just like the short term chart tbh
Bullish setup happening
For sure, just gotta hold out
2021
No im not but Im also not losing my ass and sweating when a stock drops 5%
All chinese tickers are going to take a hit tomorrow, smoothbrain move would be to buy it before it drops even more
No analysis, just a feeling man.
No not really Im just looking forward to how much money Im gunna make off this awesome dip
Lol your puts are pretty much done for the month after today no matter what I say homie. Im just happy that I got a good position in a garunteed gravy train
Lel Not even close
Im not hopping on that shit now. What does blackberry even do now
Why do you think MRNA is up so much
Like I said, I'm talking about the timeframe before 12/11.
They have no long term potential until they pivot their business model and find a way to make sales that doesn't require an army of consultants in every deal.

This is what everyone was trying to tell you retards before you all piled in.

It's a good mini-Raytheon/Lockheed for now and maybe that changes but there is no hockey stick growth in it's immediate future.
no you are ridiculous for making valuation predictions
Well everyone spammed gme calls all wknd and speculated this happening yesterday but it didnt. So idk.
12/11 615c if u want 2
Any of those are going to print today - thats where Id be if I had the cash rn, Im in similar positions I could afford lol
I want to play Tesla but theta is fucking insane on it. Wouldnt it literally have to go only up? Any dips and Ill be fucked bc of IV and theta right? Dec 18 $700c has a -1.25 and .22 delta. How do I make money on this? Ive actually never seen a theta value this high until this week. Ive only been trading since august tho
Or losing money is actually way worse
The classic move before the move
Ironically I am trying to study dopamine neural circuits aswell for neuroscience for PreMed lmao.
under rated post.   there is nothing like getting up before 5, working out,  then settling into your day at 6 before everyone else has gotten out of bed
Jesus how old are you?
Beauty company that Kylie Jenner reps
Idk but their new CEO gives me a fear boner and Im kinda into it
Kardashian
Stimmy package unveiled, u right
Shit. This isnt listed.

I made a small CVAC play that has been good as well.
Ok fuck it Im in
well supposedly there's a deal with amazon so there is one
I know that thats why Im trying to find the day they vote so I can know when to buy PDD. & I think JD was about to break out before this bullshit vote .
Amazon partnership
Those were the 3 tickers I saw mostly being pushed on here. Its no way the majority would win. So I inversed. And I just got back into options 8 days ago came back with a win. And looking at the charts for those 3 it was no doubt someone was going to be bag holding soon. Dont know about long term tho just felt it would pull back
Whats the news with NIO
Meh, I'd leave 50% in SPY or SPHD, but I do think a long position in AAPL and MSFT are no brainers and I'd like more exposure.

Same with V & MA.
Yeah, thats what I am stuck with. Its super wack - there has to be a way to move these funds into an account I can manage without penalties. As long as I don't withdraw I don't see the issue.
Lmao chill bro... your user name 100% checks out you leftie cuck.

my comment is purposely inflammatory because this is WSB, don't cry yourself to sleep, my 401k did not lose money this year you idiot.

You must actually be autistic, since you got mad for me after misreading social cues and then had an inappropriate social response to that.

You really do belong here! Long this guys portfolio!
Yea it was down 8.5% for a month, which is insane for aapl. Leaps only play right now
have a hug bro
No strikes for me, I'm in the UK so can't buy calls I just own the shares. GME is leveraged x2.
Of course, planning on just daytrading it for some quick profit since Im so down right now. Still have PLTR calls
we in this together. whats your positions
Cringe 
lol
Zip.........recruita!!!
Louis is brilliant
The 49ers QB?
Seriously, fucking listen to this u/finanicallyruined.
Florida, Mechanical Engineering
A while  meaning yesterday
Name checks out
How?
AMZN BA BRKB and CRSP without scrolling much further in my watchlist 

Also TSM is fucking ripping faces which I called out last night before close
Should I sell now
Still money to be made. Of all the tickers that get pumped I'm not sure why people are bearish on an industry that actually has major positive catalysts over the next couple weeks.

I don't think many plan on holding through. Weed is a very good play right now. Just gotta get out at the right time because there's not going to be much room for missing it.

The company doesn't have to be good or even the best. Money can be made on price action and volatility which is all this sub is about. This sub was literally buying up HTZ when it was bankrupt as a strategy. It doesn't matter if the company is in disarray or unprofitable. Is the stock moving? Is it volatile? Are good catalysts on the horoizon? Weed stocks check all these boxes for the next couple weeks.
Voting today brochacho. Should flip to the new ticker between tomorrow and Friday
I can live with that
Booku 12/18 calls, ATM/OTM
They are running a cyber tuesday discount while they fuel up the rocket 
That's what people get for buying fucking GME, cause some retard send something about a short squeeze.
you son of a bitch, I'm in
Yeah they could literally sell piles of shit. Nobody cares about what they sell thats not the point of the whole thing    
fucking guys thinking we care about a video game store lmao
You seem like a little bitch. Look at a candlestick chart, its a bearish engulfing candle. I just dont like getting that technical until some dickhead comes along like you and tries to be so serious
I always go cheap on tools, but once I buy a house Ima go in on quality shit. Im tired of using a cheap ass hammer and screwdriver for everything.
This guy gets it
Its really not lol
Ok satanist
No lol
I am way up on PLTR playing with house money.  I am no fucking bagholder.  I honestly think it has more room to run.

Amazon partnership, meme stock potential, and because I fucking said so
Likewise
Long story short its not getting legalized anytime soon
Colorado is also a shithole with a bunch of degenerates
They did 9/11!?!?
i have zero clue what people are trying to do
Theres no way it goes down to 41 thats just preposterous
its a predatory system. teachers make students feel like if they dont go to college they will be working at McDonalds their entire life.
because they never had a chance. There is no sense in shoveling money at restaurants that have no revenue. Let them fail. Tax payers being on the hook for random restaurants with shit margins even when the economy is good is a losing deal for everyone.
yeah fuck em. Its much more expensive to keep a shit business model with terrible margins operating without revenue, than it is to take a huge burden off of poor college grads
you cant expect an 18 year old to understand what they are doing. restaurant owners knew what they signed up for
Imagine he calls and says that.. they reply " well shit ,we should have known our fault. Here's your money back bud, sorry again"
I'm scared and I need you to tell me that FCEL is gonna keep mooning and my 12/18 calls are gonna help me defy all odds and breakeven on the year
I have stocks not calls but still super happy ! 

SUN
Im DIALing my friends with the good news of the merger 

GROWERS up my money !
Do you use Unusual Whales?
Thx for info buddy
25% on position.  Should I bail ?
Seriously - scam shit
Like a Modello Virus.
New retards pay attention, this is how you play meme stocks.
See, this is always where I fuck up. WHaT iF KeEPs GoiNG Up ThO??
Cause im a fucking retard
probably had MOMO FOMO
What are the forms of trading there, stocks and CFDs?
Also quick qs, do you have a S&S ISA?
It's just a nice trading platform that Revolut. I think Revolut has many issues and people are scared due to their new TOS with Brexit.
What are the forms of trading there, stocks and CFDs?
Also quick qs, do you have a S&S ISA?
We know why Trevor is gaping
I'd love to see that
10 my time or yours?
Ive got BABA and JD calls that expire January and June next year. Thinking about switching gears

Bro dont just type stuff without thinking and do some research before misinforming people
PLTR is so last week
Lets gooo
Nooo bro... its a trap
You misspelled puts
Hahahaha
Put some respect on APHA
No, leaps, last week
Im not even sure what the vote is? Something to block chinese companies? The stock reads super bullish and looks like this is the lowest it may potentially ever be.
They provide the raw materials companies will be using to make the vaccines. Im in on $30/35 calls for December and January. Stocks are solid too. I dont see why they wont be around 40-45 by the end of next year
I do. Especially in places like India
Just think about this. A decade from now they will have 800+ series and 1200+ movies of which 3% will be considered 95%+ review wise that they will have to pay no royalties for. The next office will most likely be created by them (numbers game). In two decades they will be a cash cow.
Fuck it Im in
not as funny as TSLA & feels plagiarized. 2/10
this is the way
Ill look into it
Upvoted for confirmation bias. Hope my puts print
Good because yesterday I dumped acb for  1/15 23c..
Why you say this
Use brain
I didn't
Was thinking about getting some calls and selling in the run up to earnings. ZM beat and is tanking so maybe I will sit this out actually.
I'll probably dump them if shit doesn't turn around by 10:30 ET
I have 14 friends and family that work for Boeing, 12 of them are laid off, even one person who was there for 25yrs. January earnings arent gonna be good.
That's like 80% of the people here tho including the gain porn retards
So much easier to blame someone else though.
okay; I opened a strangle on DFEN thats been -20% for a few days, but i got 3 more weeks until expiration.
i don't, but I bought them at the top in Feb.
It could if you trust gamma as an indicator.  So much fomo in the market rn.
Just pissed I sold some of my beaten down calls, up 100% though. Analysts upgrades will save your ass at times...
CINE . UK It is biggest cinema chain in UK and they own one of the largest in US as well. With good news of vaccine with recent cinemas opening this can make some nice buck.
in 5 minutes lol
Stocks run on my time. EST king gang.
I wish it would just but it's nut through 600 already too much edging
Uggh rebought too quick fuck that was a Good sell and I ruined it
Biotech is saving the world.
Dildo*
Surprised there isn't much activity about WORK on here. Expected acquisition details later today so it should be prime for weeklies
Why ...what's yr target...it can't sustain abv 593
No, I added 100 more shares and some 20c for February. Of course, I could be wrong, but the sell off has been overblown IMO
investing will tell me to hold and won't understand what mooning means
nice. or you could just hold it. Tax is scary
I actually bought the stock back in September thinking the J&J vaccine was the most promising. I havent seen any news about it recently though.
Isnt it to late for me to get into that
What was that idiot if you would of listened you could of been in and out with good profit easy 1k and I'm done for the day.
can't tell if you're serious
Tell me what happened 9/3
Yeah we printing it's all good haha. I still think this announcement could be a sell the news event but we will see
What's the catalyst?
You think this is a case of Vix moving because of positive volatility?
No i have about 25
12/18 and -55%
Youre better off bro.
Quite sweaty
Go buy PACB leaps and send me a PS5 next year
Ill put some  on my ass to make it classier
I think so :/
Not looking good :(
I might have to go long on it in that case.
Not happening. Or at least not far into the 40s. Id guess 49 is the possible bottom.
Read all the news available, not sure what ur talking about.
!Remindme 90 days
I bought more so Im up to 300
Always has been
Good for equities
Money will eventually flow out of stocks and into bonds, slowing SPY and high beta stocks that are at ATHs.  Its a good indicator of trend reversal, not happening yet.
Lol. I'm holding for a run up to $18 and then selling. Bagheld this from $12 something for too long.
Went from $460k to $354k. I need to deleverage
I dont even know why its down... I'm praying it goes higher
hell is coming
I mean - if you played PLTR and NIO right - youre not doing too bad right now. .
GMHI at the moment and will be LAZR after the merger
Man i got FDs
link?
Theyve said they will release new data in December so still time
Why
Guessing you're up bigly. Hm, if a long term LEAP makes big gains really early, I guess one could "exit" the trade by selling a higher strike call at same expiry to protect the gains, get some cash back, and get lower long term tax rates on both. Hm, this is ~~the~~ a way...
Like a real boss!
so stupid
$18-20 EOY $16 EOW

Currently riding 14.5 and 16.5 c
Ah yeah youre right, fidelity was letting me trade without funds being settled previously which was why I was confused
Thought since  theyre both involved with CDNs and are pretty much in same industry, that would make sense
If he keeps talking, Im gonna be rich today.
No, I just buy monthly tech calls.
Means they all fell way too much in one day
BOL 
Yeah I'm staying in, there is money ahead of us. No need to chase for it, just wait and hold until next year.

"he bought" I'm back in
YOU SONUVABITCH. Good call
I wish I knew this before I threw my 10k profit at some retarded play cause it was just sitting there lmao
Im aware of how a bicameral legislature works. The question is will the brief optimism of the vote passing in the house, which will likely not pass in the Senate, trigger a short term bump?
GME is fine wtf
Oh wait we  back
With that IV
Really? I thought theta increased as it got closer to ATM
They have competition but yes from an actual user base Butterfly is vastly preferred. Companies don't buy equipment because their workers enjoy using them, though. It has it's risks but regardless it will rip up huge pre merger in my mind 100%. Also Cathie Wood+ARK and the Gates family are invested into it now.
PDT?
Nah homie got the full on 90 day restriction from trading
What is PDT?
E trade.

I woke up this morning with the restriction. I havent sold anything for weeks. Only bought more.
FUUUUUU
Because I want to yolo bro
the only correct response
I agree. What if it hits 30-33 end of 2021 instead lol. If I was able to see in the future and saw that I would take out more of my shares
I know Im playing a little joke but everyone is losing their minds over it.
Fuck
My wife's bf said to get a real job.
Don't say that don't you ever say that - Adam Sandler
Just watch
Exact.
Guess who sold his call yesterday at the 119.5 resistance? 
So stocks is all we can do? That's what I'm doing currently
Been a great buy and hold. Ill change that to weekly green.
Ok thank you.
I got a 5% message.
Thank you 
The deeper ITM the spread is the closer to max gains it will be, right? So I should close pretty close to expiration if I'm confident in the play?
Awesome thanks, thats what I'm hearing from others too
Thanks, everyone else is saying the same. Debit spreads have seemed pretty scary for me to get into because of uncertainty on how to profit from them
I have ToS for my legit trades, RH is my "for fun" account (just riskier trades and learning)
You only get max profit by holding through expiration though, right?
The further ITM your spread is the wider the bid/ask for each leg is, but it shouldn't ever exceed the different in price between the strike prices.

So if I have BABA 295/300 spread you're saying I should close pretty much right at 300?
shrug have 40k+ in monthlies

up a few K.

but the real reason why i'm glad is that its breaking out of channel and is above 3200 again which its been struggling to reach/keep.

 this makes the OTM monthlies i have much more viable given delta is up way more today.
idk the lines looking pretty good tho
Ah I already made profit. IV is too high.
Yeah what a year. I fomoed in at 8
Lmaooo
Buy a 367 for 12/11. Tendies will arrive shortly
Yeah what makes it worse is thats my only call i have
jesus nah but why do you think this is an overreaction?
Okay dawg im robinhood so thats not helpful. Thank you though
Down 20 pct fml
What strike? I have 24p
I guess if you really hate money
Of course i want it to but it wont thats why I said $3500. Some people here were saying 4gs tho
agreed, not sure we got that huge spike up we all expected. Might expect slow burn up...but $610 is still great il take it
Same i took some off and sold some puts.
That Chinese companies have to be audited by us firms
Same one, only one Ive seen other than the usual dongus bot
AH and PM sales don't keep market reactions low, dumping shares into a market with much lower volume would make the price plummet even faster.
Sell it and buy one farther out.

Its not like, you enter a cheat code and get a longer expiry
Calls a month out swings ?
i trimmed some cuz it hit 2% and no one goes broke taking profit yada yad

Sell and roll them into a shorter dated. Once acquisition price comes out long dated calls won't matter
Got one for Jan 8 and 15. And another for dec 4, Im sure 12/4 is a loss lol
1/15 10c
ICLN meme stock?
No one will buy my 1/21 call Im pissed
I bought and sold this morning didnt like what I saw
More companies reduce volatility generally.
Anyone that managed to multiply their earnings by 10x thanks to PLTR last week should seriously consider getting out while theyre still ahead right now and start focusing on other stock

Edit: lol downvotes but look at PLTR this morning and yesterday and Friday and then look at it again tomorrow
cool thanks
cool thanks
Trade futures, get good
Because you want them to wait for you to take profit? 
There's also Pfizer and JNJ...
Can we not say r@pe on here anymkre ?
Just without the bots making posts.
Just like your autistic garbage stock
Yeah true. Expensive contracts for what it is
FAUTIST
pretty much
Is proof of a $1,000 trade really necessary?
Dont hold your breath
A big nothing burger. Literally
A play by our rules type bill that will come to vote on Wednesday.
So limit down confirmed?
I mean an actual BB phone. havent seen one in years
fucking chad
Must have gotten lost in the PLTR / GME jungle
I remember holding it for like 3 days  from $50 to $80 a few months ago. If only 
Lol
Gme 1/15/2021  turned them into 1/15/2022 right as the dip happened.  30c
Not the market that matters retard
Meme market like a true degenerate
/s?
Take one for the team and load up on Dec 4 $30P
No it's like PLTR but a $2bn market cap. It's so new you can't buy options yet.
Theyre a broker bro, theyre supposed to get you the best price. Even on rh Ive had it fill lower than my limit when something like this happens.

No matter tho we back in the green now
That was a reason for the last 2 months. The algos are too retarded to figure out that there's no new progress on it. Its the same shit every fucking week

It's already priced in.
Baked in.  Plus anytime government says everyone who wants a vaccine by June 2021 will get one

Really translates to the government pumping and dumping bodies after the winter
This kind of euphoria is why I'm selling everything.
What happens with every overnight jump especially the ones based on the vaccine shit?

Market dumps at open. Look at the past charts over the last month.
I play video games with my friends regularly, and yeah I get exercise. Lack of actual in person interaction is really getting to me though. Im a pretty introverted person and Im normally fine hanging out at home but this is getting to be too much.
I agree with this comment, youre right, but I have a family friend who works in HR at the largest medical network in my area, and no one is hiring. Working on the resume/linkedin etc and sending stuff out but Ive been informed to not expect anything till January/February.


Edit: and smashing puss is the fuckin main thing Im trying to do ffs. I hate texting though, tinder is boring as shit. I miss having friends to go out with and just talk to people.
I just want to make friends and get laid man
How bout eat my dick?  I have enough savings to chill for a while. Im not moving I like my area.
How about short term
How much upside do you see with MRVL? Exit price?
Yes and wait for the announcement

Take your tendies, sir
I didnt get one and I was banned for 3 days my guy, I was pissed
For shame
I meant my \~15 tickers. Yesterday only 2/15 were green and they were ACB and GME...
Was hoping for it to dip a little more before buying in. Really like the company so I want to get in before it soars
HUGE gap fills on the chart we just started the first one.  If it can stay in it (and the market doesn't randomly tank) it's gonna be a fucking crazy week
The only bing I use is a Crosby
We don't care about that yet duh

This is a comment based on the portfolios of people on WSB. It's not an investment recommendation.
Long term investors should worry, we dont, we are the tap and go, hit and run type of gang, and we capitalize on that lack of transparency, we all know it is all bullshit, and we profit while we can. Anyhow, congress is trying to pass a bill to impose strict audit rules on chinese companies listed in US, or get delisted, however, if the bill passes they will have three years to comply haha three fucking years, of course china is not happy but oh well, such is life, take what you can.
Sorry I shouldnt recommend because I dont know the details, I dont know how much loss, your positions, your financials, and more importantly your risk and loss tolerance. The good thing is you have one more week to hold and pray pltr will turn around. The bad thing is it is only one week and theta is a bitch. If you can afford that risk/loss, hold. I dumped pltr and thinking about puts, i wanna pick up some shares at bargain price or keep premium fuck it, a win win. I am up about 30% today, could-have been more two option calls are dragging my shit down, and thats ok, i can live with that, and i know they will turn around soon. Also, try to set a loss limit too, i have mine set at around 10%, unless i am confident it will turn around.
Neither can you, cause isnt a word in that context
Concerned about IV crush
Good advice, the last time I panic sold long calls was $12.5 nclh Jan 15 2021 calls. Dumbest move Ive ever made
The partnership is not worth what this bump is showing this is a memepump.
Youre also retarted read the fucking bill genius
Youre retarted the bill does NOTHING
Understandable, good day sir.
Sell sometime before close hype will be gone by tmmrw and it will pull a palantir dont be greedy
It will prolly run up again  a bit after lunch
literally everything is making ATH in this market. this is how retarded this market is
Link me?
I think so, you have people who couldn't go on their expensive vacations, eat out, go out for drinks. You have parents who are going to spoil the fuck out of their kids because it's "been a hard year". You have retards sitting at home all day getting overpaid to online shop.

 can't wait to see some loss porn
Great I trust you completely

Penny stock pump and dump
Its fun to dial up my friends with news of the merger 
Indeed, but if it merges with a better company.....boom. Tendies.
Patience. Not for paper hands. Were weeks out at this point.
just hold on my guy, nothing big will happen until theres official news on the status of the merger
oh yeah im not selling until theres actual news, my average price is around $12 a share

im just wishing good vibes on you all
We all have to choose a hill to die on my brother in arms.

What sort of flu frequently puts regular people on O2?
I know right? Once it hit $19 I knew a MM reversal was imminent. Happened in October, what made people think it wouldn't happen again? WSBers are delusional man
Facts jc all day 
Check my username bro. I'm so bullish in my everyday life I've dedicated my reddit account to it. Thats sacred. But this is going to come down before it goes back up.
If SPY closes about 368 I'll come back here and dub you Wallstreet Overlord.
He's the god level bear lmao. I'm a bull and he has fucked me more times than I'd like to admit with that geriatric dick.

A certain digital commodity that was nearing ATH

Announced a partnership with Amazon to develop an operating system/platform for vehicles called IVY that will allow easier data sharing across vehicle manufacturers, sale of in-car apps, stuff like that.

TLDR: they're doing something with Amazon involving vehicles.
Oh fuck I forgot I have robinhood gold

Production crashing, value on existing cut steel skyrockets for a short period of time. Has not happened in long time
V nice, Ive been in for a week and am up 200% on $19 1/18s
Nanana
This is accurate
Exactly.
Ya Im up 500k, and was up a mil at 33, but the taxes stopped me.. in a year it should go back up anyway, this is my long term all in
I'm sure it'll pop up. It's always the same shit. They sell off when these assholes talk and then buy it up when they are done talking. At least we don't have to worry about Trump tweets anymore.
Calls are down bigly.
I'm just looking for 27 before Friday and then 30 before end of year.
Thanks!
and how!
lol.  


I bought in GME at the $9 range my friend, ive already cashed out plenty enough that i could blow up my accounts twice over and still not be concerned.  


Check my post history from 61 days ago, I stated my position, i cant remember the price at the time lets assume its was $11. I had 1360 shares lets assume at worst im a dumb fuck and never rolled any positions and all i have right now is 1360 shares..  


And i sell at open anywhere near say .. 17?, That's an $8160 US gain, What was your last trade?  


Pretty sure warren buffet isnt out performing my "meme" portfolio right now, im 100% sure hes making a fuck ton more money than i am and always will, and my strategy may not be sustainable but to call me warren buffet right now is just fucking low mate.
No source mate just throwing wild thoughts out there to see what happens.
Playing both sides of this like im not some mindless GME bull? no thanks sir, but i see your point.
I think its an american thing or is it wendys?
Lmao thats a fabulous bar from like 2006
Bro you using off brand Crayons lmao
New month new lows. Also I have no faith in WSB to keep it up after yesterdays performance. Weak hands all over this bitch. Shitron will get their way and then it will go back up and WSB will claim victory.
I'm trying to help avoid max pain, stop deluding people into losing their money lol
Bu I feel like it wood!
Its 2020. Im don't hate anyone im just sick of it. I lose promotions because I'm not married and white at work all the time. Its bullshit.
Oddly enough, the first thought that came to mind was what if your publicly traded company was based in WV? Would be hard to find a minority there.
Because representation doesnt matter. Whoevers best for the position should be there regardless of race or gender. These are multi billion dollar corporations that are obligated to protect shareholders financial interests. It doesnt matter how underrepresented or overrepresented a certain group is.
because it placement based on non-merit based qualifications. To say you must pick candidate X over candidate Y because of their gender, sexual orientation, skin color, etc is wrong on many levels. It's only when its done in favor of white men do people complain. Utter hypocrisy.  


I invested in companies that make money, not ones that make political statements.
As a single guy I lose promotions at work all the time.
Because gender and race has no relevance to your performance. Plus its the most racist shit ever to be forced to hire based on race or gender alone.

You know what, maybe we should do everything based on race and gender. Loans, taxes, mortgages, laws, prices of groceries, water fountains especially. I can't see what would be a bad idea about it. What could go wrong if we emphasize race and gender over performance?
Nice, I think just dont make it required, just give the company a tax break or something. There are a ton of smart women out there. Look at amd ? She fucking killing it. Im not against women. But, I feel like this free giving shit needs to stop. "Unpopular opinion ".
I understand that. I rather see something like a tax break if you added a women or minority, something like that. Not make it required though.
Crushed earnings, dropped huge after earnings most of country back on lockdown.. also J.P. Morgan gave them a price upgrade
facts bro
I dont have a brokerage app I call my stock broker or send it via fax
pp :)
lol no
NNOX and SPY spreads
Even if it does itll sit on that fuckin crow faced bastards desk till it all burns. Some people just hate money 
Dump after pump
Eh, to go up further, over extended stocks need to pull back or at least go sideways for a while. No stock in history has gone parabolic without eventually tanking.
yea these worthless companies are nothing like AMZN or GOOGL
those will bleed out nicely
We shouldn't bail out big businesses or banks either. You seem to be for bailing out universities with billions in endowments.
They're getting fucked by the universities, which are allowed to fuck them because the student loans are given out like candy by the government.

It's bad because you're essentially subsidizing academia to charge whatever they want, whether the student gets an education or not or whether the degree is useful in the market.
No... they buy puts, lose money, and suck dongs.
Yeww, that's what I meant. For the upcoming months
After the next 5:1 split.
Every time I tell ppl they missed the boat, it pops off after hours.
Better late than never
Bought in $187 9th Nov @ $41.
Now its $39.
Why?
Old high school mates, i'm 39, and i'm in Scotland, and it's a pretty good buy signal if people are drooling over it in public.
yes
Chillin and watching people talk about PLTR, im buying what looks like a dip before a remoon. I think i have semi good intuition as CRSR legit just blew up right after i bought calls but as I said, could be tarded. They were pretty cheap calls so im willing to lose em.
It's already gone down ~10% since the WORK news broke
Yep
Research buddy, why would you invest into something you dont know? Makes 0 sense
Uffff worse advice ever. Yeah buy into a pump and dump
I was thinking more cyber security deals were on the horizon. Turns out it was auto tech
its always like that...

until it does
nah VIX calls worded it weird my bad
Well excuuuuuuuse me
I made bank on them but idk if were gonna see ATHs or not
Nah it just seems like its losing steam and has topped out around here recently. Not holding for long but also just expecting a market wide dip in the short term. Also Im not good at this
No argument here. Ive done poorly recently so everyone should inverse me

It's overdue.
We all have a partnership with Amazon. BB is such a semi-annual disappointment of a company.
Yea they got wiped out, this is the rest
The squeeze isn't going to happen with this volume. It's also peak wsb to think that a bunch of small money can coordinate to get it to move up enough.  

Is barely moving right now it's like every 20 seconds the ticker moves
I mean the thousands of dead would but they are dead.

So technically right...
Definitely not. But actually true
Idk if BB is a rocket ship but their software's being used in one
Thats literally why Im asking this. Jfc youre a plank

Lol
then they whine and cry about how we're the retarded ones and how it's actually our fault
It's on SEC, a vote will be held whether they will be postponing the merge. If it doesn't go through, the merge won't happen... This is why  is dropping so hard today. I got off all my warrants with a 20-30% profit but will be holding the shares.

Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.

 Got me beat!
Because those calls aren't going to hit their strikes?
True if big
Who couldve thought looking back at the charts would give insights?  Im holding my shares and Im up a nice percentage but it hasnt been exciting the past few days

Ya I dont get how that changes my opinion
With few excepts, Im the same way.
I've got Fidelity but that only shows 13F filings which are quarterly. How would a broker get the information outside of that?
What's a smart money
I think just just assumed my meaning. I am offended...
Care to elaborate? I don't understand the bee thing lol.
Hold strong. I am in with 200 shares each, too. Very high cost basis. (Currently in red)
Well.... I'm up x2.5 on calls I bought at open so there's that
No, assuming you don't have weeklies. If you have shares hold on until at least after earnings and if you have calls that expire in January or later hold
All in my Roth IRA babyyyy. So much easier than explaining 300 retarded trades to the IRS.
Will def be going up, uk using palantir for border control. Palantir is going to be everywhere by 2021 end.
Ok. Still in with 24. No more money to invest im sorry :P

Oof, I'm sorry, anon.
yeah tbh gets to a point where its nor worth, gotta move onto next play, gl man
No, I need you to buy your own PS5 so GME goes up.
yes
Ya know what, ya, I'm gay bear against PLTR rn. But I'm also an ex PLTR bull who made tendies near the top and got the fuck out of dodge. Ya permabulls are real windowlickers and need to learn to read the writing on the wall rather than sitting in your echo chamber all day
"In this market? At least 95%, put the rest in an ETF that generates 5% yearly. You're great-great-great-grandchildren will thank you for that 20% return."

I bought more today, I think a lot of people got baited into this over Thanksgiving and are now panic selling because of these swings. The float is mostly retail owned, someone linked that a few days back. 

Waiting for the UK confirmation to see some reasonable growth back up.
That's good

Up 31% in 3 months. On the move 
It always rockets early then dips through the day. Buy at EOD and catch tomorrow's boom. If you buy at open you'll only lose if you're day trading

PLTR 24p 12/4 its sad to see Im up from one of my fav meme stocks at an all time low

Sorry for your loss man. I was being cheeky before but I have had my fair share of losses and it's never fun.
Diamond hands baby

What if it doesn't recover? There's an incoming correction probably in the next week and im panicking a bit
Jeeze bro sorry to hear that. I'm feeling shaky at 12/31

Appreciate it
My avg is $17.7 
yea but i basically lost my savings, so Im going to peace out until i feel confident in my bank account again to get into stocks. Options are out of touch for at least 2 years

Alright brother im in. Expiry?

Yeah exactly. I'm down on NIO too but going to double down with leaps when it settles down.

Ok now Im too baked to think through the math but according to investopedia the short % is calculated

Number of shares shorted/number of total shares

So I think youre right it could be infinite
Now thats some meta shit. You should open a brokerage that offers leveraged shorting
Bro they have 3 years to comply and they will comply. I think youre a bear trying to secure puts but its not gunna work we arent that stupid
size isnt everything cut out investment bankers, get a larger valuation, lower costs, less pop money on the table, less SEC disclosure requirements, founders shares and usually a promote but I dont think Ackman does that. higher valuation, more control, less fees. seems appealing.
At least no body riots in 12 degree weather.  lol.
Lol. Lived in Chicago for 2 years. Loved the city but thats a big pass on the weather
No gonna gap back to 18.5
Weird
Yep, have some 12/11 $9c. Got rid of half yesterday and riding out my last half a bit to milk some tendies. Thinking about getting some january calls to play earnings. Maybe around $12 or so..
whoops looks like it actually did
That just means that you will be bagholding till April unless you get out now.
I mean if you bought it today, then yeah. I bought mine on Friday I believe and its working out pretty well. We just need one massively green day and it would push past 600
You got time. Thought it expires Friday. Either way its better to walk away with some money knowing a good play can put you back up
Nice. Im holding MRO leaps, but only a couple
Youll be alright man, tesla is the king of EV everyone is just trying to catch up. S&P 500 inclusion is just giving a stamp on it. If you could afford to exercise you should.. I see 2021 as the breakout year.
it's all fun and games until someone loses their bankroll.
She dumped. 
luckily for me im really young and a software guy so itll all come back... not worth taking my life over but am depressed ahah
I tell myself that I'm going to sell off every morning because thats literally what this retarded stock does, it starts off high, falls down hard, and then consolidates in the mid 20s all fking day. There is so many good plays happening in the market (not meme stocks) that actually follow some indicators and technicals and I cant get in. Fking irritatting.
Dang, Im still operating on my stimulus check
hold them. dont sell. trust the squeeze alot to be made
Then what were u doing when it was at 9?
Agreed. If it ever gets to 20 im doubling or tripling my longs
Youre gonna diamond hand the next meme and retire at 40
Yeah i think having some cash on the side on the side is best play. Going against the bubble is just insane
Sure but my point about people paying egg heads to organize their data any blank check amount is still the main point
Can you explain it on this particular scenario ? I am too retarded to completely understand it
Where the fuck do you live? Bangladesh?
you can't resist those tight curls.  he'd be shirley temple if he was a 12yo girl.
Spike at open and slowly bleed down to about 16.60 sideways for most the day and back up to 17.35 at close.
Thats what people have been saying
Set a limit order ALWAYS. Never market sell because you know TSLA movement is crazy. Basically, if at open volume is high and its holding premarket highs I sell at 0.01 cent loss on my limit order to get filled immediately. If volume is very low and Im worried itll crash I sacrifice 0.02 cent on my asking to get filled immediately. If the stock rockets I place my limit order at 0.03 higher than the current ask because It'll get eaten up so quick. Just my strategy. Basically if you see it dying take a little off your profit and get tf out. If its mooning up your limit above the current ask and make even more.
Ones that have merger targets are no longer $10 lol. Or theyre at $10 with a merger target bc market doesnt like it. If you want to make money w SPACs gotta be patient
There she goes
Damn, sorry bro
Good point, thanks!
The word Ive been hearing is at open
Might sell my shares for some MGNI, best luck retard
Its dipping now, I just bought
You're not gonna be able to afford a gym membership to help you lift them heavey bags
12/04 367p. Its bound to dump back down to at least $365 before Friday, even if it ends the week at ATH.
Your talking about an untouched market of logistics.
Huh.. maybe its just the auditing thing thats being voted on for China stocks
Well thats better than what I had written about. Congrats.
Too late
Strike on one is 37.10 (12/11, 34 call, horrible timing)

Strike on the other is 26.95 (12/11, 24 call, decent timing, should of cashed)

any advice / guidance is appreciated bro - embarrassment is little lesser on the internet - moves like these make me dive in confidence smh - Id probably quit if I get screwed on this
with low margin requirements.. one could be happy with a quick and good return
the company is going bankrupt what is there to explain? They made less money every year since 2013.
Lol yeah Merrill was down for like 4 hours last Tuesday. Im moving my main account from them to TD.
E trade has NEVER crashed for me
Didn't know that. For me it works well since I have my retirement accounts, their credit card, and you get more benefits like pre ipo at 100k then higher cash back on the credit card from 250k+ so I decided to park all my serious long term investments here and use robinhood for yolos and fun. It feels very full to me in terms of features like creating very specific market orders, setting stop losses and and that stuff. Simple interface
Ok sorry dad
PM me Ill send you my PayPal 
1/15 700C
Never had one but it sounds awesome. Girls used to text in their ugg with them
I did shares. Who knows how long itll take
Ill probably do both. I was thinking for my actual portfolio though
Thanks for capitulating
Just geting murdered on my 1/15 calls
What?
Who knows what the long term consequences are, dont let that stop you from making money now. Yeah, youll definitely run out of money before the market calms down.
HAHAHAHAH

You, it's still you
so my tendies are saved?
Little tingle inside... idk I have calls but still think paper hands are going to be selling the next couple days, then a green week hopefully
Yeah you wanna bet? 
Oh nice. How much % up?
12 eow tho not crazy
They wont tho
You can probably see a little bit of green on those if you sell PLTR around 10-10:30 tomorrow morning.  It usually spikes in the AM and then gets beat the fuck down the rest of the day.
Lol yeah hahahaha which makes this even funnier eh?
That IV is outrageous
This year has been amazing for malls what are you talking about??
Thats the definition of charity youre paying to rescue dogs lol I didnt mean dont start a charity. But I was being sarcastic
Lol
*bzzzzzz
We a long way from breakout
Yeah, but hes batting cleanup and should be at .500.  My ass wouldnt be screaming incoherently on CNBC if my portfolio underperformed the S&P.
True that's pretty wild. But there's a good chance we keep going to 400.
Not a fucking DD post. Go look for yourself.
Yeah it needs to be stored at cold as fuck temperatures or it will almost instantly go bad and not work. It makes distribution a nightmare trying to get out hundreds of millions of vaccines if they need to always be at -80 celsius or whatever the temperature is. If another one works at the same or even higher rate, why the fuck would we use the PFE vaccine over MRNA
Vaccine doesn't move bottom line for PFE
Well I think technically you are right. But that 2-3% happened last week right?  It went back to 355ish then came back to ATHs. I think this is the breakout we've been hearing about and 360 is the new support with 370 being the new ATH by end of week. 

Obviously I'm biased because of my position but in fairness I plan to sell at least half, if not all, at open today
It's only 8%, not that unreasonable to be honest.
That too far otm for 2 weeks
HaI saw the other poster make up an expansion for the ticker initialism, and I was trying to do a rural juror equiv for PSTH. Hope it runs today! Happy Cake Day!
Ah yes. I have 50 measly shares myself. Cheers mate, let's get this bread
Someone bought em. What confuses me is what type of retard is buying the 17.50 strikes, it's not much money but I'm tempted to sell those naked
Yea same here especially considering their profits which are negative
JPM just announced theirs at $191 (not for EOY tho). Me personally, realistically, $140 by Jan
Pros: VERY convenient, high quality internals (I took mine apart), customer service is pretty good, it has a floating lever to tell you when to empty the drain pan, lot of 3rd party support for cleaning materials filters and replacements, Oh and most important, the coffee itself tastes great once you get the grind and amounts right, great for using fresh beans, you go from whole beans to liquid coffee very quickly. 

Reasonable: maintenance is not too bad, cleaning cycles are automatic and require minimal setup, settings are pretty minimal though maybe I haven't explored it too much 

Cons: it's pretty DAMN loud. For grinding, extracting, and using the water/steam spout, you will definitely wake up people in the same room. And I've noticed some QC problems. There's one at my office and one at my parents house as well, and theirs has either a broken pressure dial or the extractor itself can't get a high enough pressure. They're too lazy to send it back, the coffee still comes out tasting good too

It's great if you're the type to make 1-2 cups at a time, I like it a lot.
Its way more intuitive for sure. Not completely necessary but for the extra $200 or so I definitely think its worth it.
I mean no, but the class of car matters, and not sure what class this would be put in
did the same but held that shit through. we will see the 600s today brother
Why? It's already valued at $50 billion.
Hmmm maybe consider covering them with higher up calls expiring this week or something to fend off theta crush
I read it in a Reddit comment on the spacs page when it was priced at 10
I don't. I'm curious what tmw brings
LOLOL JUST LIKE THAT IT DOESN'T GO UP ANOTHER CENT ONCE I BUY
I have no idea man. No one does. Ask yourself why you bought it in the first place. If you bought it at this price (breaking even) it means you thought it was going places. Has the recent news about audits changed you mind about the company? Do you still see it growing in the next 5-8 years? If your sentiment about the company is still positive and forward looking than i would advise not to sell on a big red day like today. Emotions can be tricky.
Without losers you cant have winners.
Next years headline: Autistic man flies a Cessna 172 into a California Target store this morning for the *meme potential*
Oh my
Well who do you think is driving these shit stocks higher? You want to make money you need these tards to bid up the shares so you can sell and leave them with the bag.
I should have applied a similar strategy to GME. At least my retarded ass learned.
If you like losing money. 

Selling worthless FD's to retards fills you with a sense of power tho
Actually reinforces that it could definitely climb. But I don't know how much, if any, dilution had happened since then
Thank you for this information!  and i wish you luck in the future
If all like, 5 vaccines are rejected? Sure.
Oh my fucking god Im absolutely going to lose all of my money holding GME
Fuck him
And it's only like 400$. Not a biggy if it expires worthless
Ok that makes sense, I was wondering what Warren buffet was doing on WSB
Interesting. I mostly play tech cause Im more familiar, any industries worth keeping an eye on

Ugh Friday was really the day to get in. After a 40% day it's hard for me to recommend honestly
Right, and the vote. Does it crash after both?
Enjoy that ramen diet
I think its gonna bleed back into the low 20s. Gotta watch what citron actually said we are short til 20. 

So with that said theyre prob going to buy in around 21. 

Ive been in a stock they shorted before and they called it an absolute zero, they had nothing bad to say about it other than it being a casino, which it was.
Nothing bad to say about pltr*
But you obviously *knew* it wouldnt hit $40, so why didnt you buy puts? If youre confident that buyers were idiots then put your money where your mouth is. Otherwise stfu with your 20/20 hindsight
Lmfao
And there's no way that a company would embellish on an S-1, right? 

In 2013 we had a camera that could capture muzzle flashes from a mile away and give you coordinates to send to a rocket launcher that you could lock onto and fire and forget but watch it hit a guy in the shoelaces from a camera on the tip of the missile, and we weren't even close to well-equipped.

I get that you're trying to pump a stock, but, like, come on bud.
That aged well

I added some put sells for pltr but the call fd's I sold you guys a couple weeks ago printed hard for you
Lol if you can't lose money and laugh about it you're in the wrong sub

Naked calls and cash secured puts (basically margin), strangling RKT 18-23 and PRPL 25-35. I actually feel there is some potential in both to go over the high end therefore I'll keep to sold puts after the calls expire this month.

EDIT: I wouldn't mind getting assigned at 18-20 for RKT and 25-27 for PRPL either. I'd then proceed to wheel them.
Get a real broker.
Ah! Thank you.

I thought there would have been anticipation/people buying up to the senate decision to decriminalize.
They had their earnings call back at the end of October or early November - likely just chop post call. Also they have had a hell of a run over the past year. I dont think Id do options for them, would hold stock tho. This company is biggest supplier to hospitals, labs, and pharma companies. They also have an allergy blood test that has incredible profitability - that part of their business likely suffered due to COVID but it should rebound in 2021. The test is like literally printing money for them.
That's a good thing, right?
My heart hurts
Bro... Please don't - this market is on steroids making all time highs.
Good shit!!
oooh snap
No problem, looks like puts would have cucked you friend
Cockblockers. Itll manage
Thats fair but is she an exception to a trend or the start of a new trend? I just dont see a way for anyone to take significant share from apple. For the TV market, it seems super saturated with lots of different players - however Samsung and Sony seem to be the leads. Nokia might make money if they find their niche and own it, but fighting over table scraps cant be a long term strategy
Ty
Ah. I got in at $24 and sold at $47. Bought yesterday at $40. Quite confident itll shoot back up
Honestly can't tell if serious...

Yeah man lol shit is nuts
fuck yeah bro, calls on the relationship.

congrats for real, it's not easy to find a female autist partner :)
I hear you. Good luck on those sweet gains.
Last quarter price peaked over 70 almost a week before earnings, by earnings day it was 60 and a few days after that it was 53. And they destroyed earnings estimates q2.

Look Im long on CHWY and if you play this earnings and win Ill be happy for you, but I wouldnt view this as a slam dunk
Whats your position.
Dont doubt my vibe.  We were at 20 yesterday.

Plenty of time for good news to bounce us back
That would be a lotto ticket at best. Realistically I don't see much room below 390 as worst case. My last ride I got in at 410 and just sold at 476 right before earnings. Held for about 1 month
What changed ? Vaccines are working, elections over, transition process started. Dont see the cause of this sudden doom
Maybe do 50$ this week and 50$ the next? It really is a gamble with great potential just very high risk.
all money finds it way back to assets, regardless of who you pay it to?
Lol @ bagholding. My average is $16
Its a relatively small position but yes, doing well.  Im a bit over-leveraged in SPACS atm but Im looking to build my stake in Canoo - I think its a great product & disruptive business model with a lot of upside potential in 2021/2022.

That makes sense, but if he was to throw a mil in puts before he submitted the targets then sell right after a mini dump. Thatd be legit?
 
haha okay
What the fuck is the point of investing if you can't be dick suckin poor?
Im thinking of switching over to a master of Econ and working numbers for some biopharm company. Not sure yet though.
I would agree with you if the timeline given was 6-12 month. These companies are getting 2-4 years. I think that would be more than enough time to find good qualifying candidates for the required position
If you think there are qualified women and minorities, but you also know these companies have ZERO women or minorities, how can you not realize that these companies are discriminating?

Also, it's 2020. Having one single woman in a board of 10-20 members, isn't really a big requirement.
I know its diversity but like you said...arent ya suppose to hire capable people and not what for the sake of diversity? This accomplishes nothing.
just know that they generate 50 cents of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue
Nice man, recently got the previous version of submariner no date a few months ago, definitely a gorgeous watch. Been looking at the datejust a lot, it is gorgeous as hell with a jubilee bracelet and fluted bezel. Daydate is hella expensive but imo it is the most gorgeous rolex though if you're prime with it then by all means.

I keep an eye on the pair at all times, but nothing is fool-proof.
positions or ban
600 EOW youll be fine
I'm not entirely sure any calls are making money. They all priced in large movement. However, an in the money call would be more likely to make you a profit come Friday. Your current out of the money call is going to need to get very lucky and TSLA will have to moon in the next couple days for you to see profit.
Nice, picked up the same one

I would give you 1 tendy at market open, but it's now only worth 9/10th of a tendy due to this bullshit market.
Theyre the Chinese EV leaders and their delivery capacity just capped out. Theyre growth is gonna get very slow soon until they can expand.
You are smarter than me...I need more patience. But I think its still a good buy.
agree. still 2x+ til pre-covid numbers.  Cruises are still not traveling anytime soon. so still have time to DCA.
I swear the minute I dumped money into it, it dipped an entire dollar. All in a span of a minute.
The higher the IV of an option, the higher priced the premiums are. Essentially, the market makers are "pricing in" the large movements of the price of the underlying stock. That is why puts aren't going up that much. The huge drop is already priced in. It has to drop an extreme amount to really make a huge profit.
Is that when you got it or was this an FD?
The 10s will print
Would need to read more about this AWS contract, but I expect them to dump back down before long, maybe not to 5-6 but lower than where we are now.
Oh I definitely agree with that. I think BABA is one of the absolute best stocks right now which is why I'm fucking loaded to the tits on it: https://imgur.com/KzhvY0g
Obviously from a greener day but you get the point.
Lmao im holding my weeklies for a daytrade this shit either has a big green thirsday or a big green friday

Or maybe it pumps today idk

I think EOW were higher than now FWIW, maybe 17, i think we touch 25 at some point but this stonk pumps and crashes hella
Possible, but not super likely imho
Dont fomo if you want to make it in the long run, its been at 20 or less for weeks
It is a 1:1 analogy when your argument was literally just based on it takes a long time lol
they don't have to be positive, Cohen has already expressed massive dislike of current leadership and potential interest in taking over the company, 1 more bad earnings call gives him his opportunity, meaning a large recall of stock and a massive squeeze. [Also, this DD is a good place to start.](https://as.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/)
5k buys you another 200 moon tickets 
Yeah, maybe it'll be different this time with the way the market is now. I had RIMM shares from around $40 that I had to ave down on to death and finally got out on some pump to $12 a couple of years ago with some gains. I thought I was going to die with those shares.
308
Looks to be moving to 310-320 in the short term before a possible pull back. But thats just looking at support/resistance on the fly while driving down the road.
Hope so because own quite a bit of ARKK and ARKG.  Pretty optimistic as well.
Yeah, I don't actually think so either. Only way I could see it tanking hard at this point is if the entire stock market plummets and takes everything down with it which is unlikely.

Based on what?
Lmao you were saying
Nah mostly from the TSLA run up then i went all in on GME
Make sure you just got some day trades left, thats how I always fuck up.
This was back when AMZN was going from $3400 to $3500, I think like 3-4 months ago
Its a thingy used to measure angles and altitudes when navigating hope that helps
Time to test these diamond hands.
Oh hell yes. Loading up on calls while they're cheap
thats short volume as a percentage of daily trading not the total outstanding interest.
So theyre talking about stocks on their own? Ya thats a top indicator if Ive ever seen one
I know were beyond the bubble. But tbf I dont see it popping that hard so long as people have high hopes for Tesla long term. Pushing 600 though is when EVERYONE will start to realize its overpriced. At $400 at least people still felt it could hold
I see now. Im dumb
they coming for u now
I am only in for 5k and I have that split between shares and 12/31 calls!

Ride or die bitches!
Correct
Runescape?
This I agree with, weak hands are going to get shook out for the next few months like Tesla, then the stock will start to appreciate to reflect the value of the company and hit 100 in the next few years.
Please wear condom.
That is sad. Just buy and hold. As long as you invest in a good company there's no need to worry.
I would just hold then
As great as this place is there is a lot of dumb here, and the more popular it gets the dumber its going to get as well.

Naw. Vaccine, stim, Biden. No crash here. Get on board.
Good luck my man. Youre pretty naive to think anyone knows whats a sure bet in this market.

Yesterday.
It has some potential, it's pretty largely shorted too. It certainly could pop.
Me too followed yr strategy ...tho i went in yesterday only ...so no profits as yet
You can do a rollover into a Roth but youll need to pay a fair amount of taxes. Its worth looking into, but you might consider leaving a portion behind to mitigate your risk a bit.
Ahhh
3200c for 12/11, 2 contracts
What is cringe?
No
Word, to answer your question you stop being a degenerate by giving up on weekly calls way OTM. I dont have anything expiring in 2020 now because I lost 10k overnight on Sept 8 and gave up on that shit.
Buy in the money covered calls and sell tomorrow or Thursday. If the stock goes up a little, theta will get you 15-20%. Buying an hour ago would have already gotten you 20% probably
Well Im bag-holding 12/31 $27 and $28 so i hope so.
its a cup handle. lmfao u think candlesticks are serious and technical???? good luck w ur investments u need it lmfao. you know NOTHING
Oh yea for sure. The impact driver you will use everywhere. Other tools honestly best advice is to buy cheap and if you break it you know you use it enough to warrant a quality version.
I need balls! I havent bought in yet
its not the worst thing in an emergency lol
nah bro just the page in the back thats empty
specifically the last reason
search GME short squeeze
Trade schools OP. Welding, electricians, HVAC, plumbing, mold remediation. Tons of places hiring, good pay, and no debt.
100% predatory
Well why be on the hook for college students? 

Theres plenty of opportunities to have student loans forgiven through public service if someone does not want to pay back loans they took out.
Its no ones fault they made a personal choice to pursue a shit degree. What makes a restaurant a shit business? You are guaranteed a blue haired LGBTQ socialist bastard. With spy puts
Haha yeah restaurant owners knew we were gonna get hit by a global pandemic this year and the government was gonna force them to lock the doors. You are semi right though with your not knowing what theyre doing comment. I blame it on the fucking retarded cookie cutter parents stuffing the you have to go to college and get a degree to be successful garbage down their throats
Look at it this way, if the restaurants get their funding, all the kids with these useless degrees will still have a place to work to pay off their loans
Strike price? Ive been in an out of fcel since 3.50. Shes never done me wrong. Young green energy tech in a young green energy tech bull market. Im sitting on 1/15 12$ an not sweating
Oops I answered the wrong comment. But happy for ya
Yes, that's where i got the alert from.
If you have to ask, take profit fooooooor sure lol
I know T212 has CFDs and Stocks. I only do shares. Freetrade I dont really use but has a nice interface so I cant help you there sorry. I dont have my S&S ISA with either, thats dealt with by Vanguard.
NY
why?  they've been losing money for years!
I guess it's WSB story time.

Chinese companies have been listed on US exchanges since ~2013. All other foreign stocks listed in the US must allow audit by entity called PCAOB. However China has effectively refused to do so but still been allowed to list.

This mostly comes down to TCEHY and BABA been too good for US capital markets to pass up and both being big wins for Wall Street underwriters which have stupid amounts of lobbying power in Washington during this era.

Fast forward to nowish and we have Luckin Coffee. Complete fucking accounting scam that fucked US investors out of a shit ton of coin. This basically soured the Wall Street situation with unaudited Chinese stocks playing on US exchanges. Previously with high quality stocks like BABA/TCEHY this wasn't a problem so Wall Street didn't want to change status quo but this is basically a case of biting the hand that feeds.

Now couple that with Orange Man. He wants some sort of legacy and that is mostly to be hard-line nationalist and "standing up to China" (lol). He jumps at the chance to push for delisting and banning of Chinese companies on top of tradewar escalation.

Republicans have had this idea for a while now Mnuchin actually had a policy group suggesting similar changes as to those in the current bill except a bit more lenient, having a built in back door to use US accounting firms in place of PCAOB audit.

So given all this context what exactly does the bill say?

Basically foreign companies (not just Chinese but in practice just Chinese) will be delisted if they haven't been audited by PCAOB for 3 consecutive years. Additionally they must also show they are not under control of a foreign government. So state owned companies as are common in Singapore, China, etc may be affected by this second rule.

BABA is probably the strongest Chinese company. It is a true juggernaut that dwarfs AMZN but trades at a fraction of its multiple because of the "Chinese discount". That being said, US investors are fickle and aren't value orientated (as can be seen from the CV19 crash and subsequent market behaviour). So there is a still a good chance it gets hammered down to ~255 on panic selling.

However it's real price should be around ~340 right now even accounting for the Chinese discount. You can't keep that beast down forever so it's going up eventually, just a matter of when.
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. Basically, all foreign corporations will be delisted from exchanges if they are not in compliance of auditory supervision for 3-years.

I own a metric ton of BABA and am holding (selling CCs) but I sold my CWEB (like a TQQQ  for China) waiting for the expected drop after vote passes on wed.
Its about how Chinese companies are audited. Baba already has said theyre in compliance already because they use a third party auditor 

* supposedly * I dont remember where I saw that and Im not invested in them so havent looked it up.
last I checked India wasn't in Europe though.
Ok, but in the near term this doesnt bode well for them.
Netflixs content is shit and going downhill regularly. Competition in the space heating up and wont slow down. 

Apart from further international expansion, they need actual business innovation if they want to see legitimate growth from here on out.
They struck a deal with Amazon for EV Data stuff, read the article
Okay, a) I dont have much of one. 2) this market will inevitably do exactly the opposite of what makes the most logical sense, and d) we will have stimulus talks going well by then. SPY $420
You cash out?
I work there too. All of that is true, but not unexpected. It should already be priced in. The stock jumped for the MAX return, which is going to bring in much needed revenue.
i couldve sold at +35% but ended up selling at -5%, shit happens
Exactly bro! Let's get these tendies!
600 but it do kinda be looking like I should sell and rebuy the dip now
we dont buy stonks here just options brother
Trial results are expected early next year. But Id be shocked if they were distributing their vaccine by summer
Just dipped
did you mean to post that 1k brag in r/babystreetbets ?
Data is everything, consulting makes them a more appealing company to work with, strong management team, history of govt. contracts
while we moved up yeah it was some euphoria, almost a 1.5 sigma move at the top
Hold. You have time
But vxx is rising as well. Signifying a dump smh.
 thats great
Hey it isnt called drill kings for nothing. I think mid 40s are a possibility, but if it dips to 48,49 I will buy and dca if I have to
Merge will either be postponed till April or it will fail. The vote will take place 12/3. People are getting out now or they will be bagholding till April
F

yes deleverage now lol
Worries bout delisting
Yeah me too or im fucking off
Because our economy is fucked for a while and we will be at negative interest rates soon and the Fed knows it
I've got some 15c leaps. I'll let them run and see if it gets to $20.
But FSLY dropped hard due to TikTok?
I'm rooting for you! gj man
I hope they keep free fallin
Yes. Just hope it fixes by second half January for my Jan calls.
eyyy, we eating good tonight son!
Hell. You may turn that 10k into a 10 bagger then drop 90k into your bank for some prime time shopping. But yeah. My experience is if you have gold, clear a slae you can deposit money directly into your bank.
Only due to absolute retards, seeing as how they're meme stocks I mean maybe. No big money is going to follow that vibe - absolutely none.
Oh shit just checked, were stable now
Good point actually I've only got a $10 call I got cheap
Theta increases exponentially as you approach the expiration of the option. options ITM/ATM will have lower theta decay compared to an option OTM at the same expiration. This is because an OTM option will expire worthless unless the underlying moves enough to make it ITM. Thats essentially what the bet is when buying OTM options; they are cheaper, and can make you larger % returns, but they have a tendency to expire worthless and someone has to get stuck with the bag
I bought $130 weeklies when it was $117 yesterday - they were 2c and 3c, I'm averaged in for 2.2cents.

I aint fuckin selling!
Pretty much ! I do the same and Im trying to do tastyworks when I can get it working
Sure, but you need to be sure you are able to close out before closing bell. Liquidity on spreads is sometimes horrible
Once theyre in the money theres no reason to hold since your profit is capped unless you wanna close one leg prematurely

Robinhood is a bad platform for spreads too their customer support is less than dogshit if something happens
Youre scraping the bottom of the barrel because in this case the opposite sides of the are gaining and losing value pretty equally when they are in the money.
Now it's moving!   Hope I didn't jinx it
Idk man... thanksgiving covid spike incoming within 2 weeks
Hopefully it will moon soon. Gl brother
Because they are guiding for 300% growth next quarter. I dont think it continues to sell off
Ah; ty
But it won't keep dumping because of other investors panicking and sell limits triggering. A lot of brokers only exercise limits during trading hours.
Im holding my 12/24s, just along for the ride
I don't know what you consider "big red" but ok.
What u got?
Yes.. I understand that.  He said choppy and updown updown does not necessarily mean big peaks and valleys but small hills and gulleys.
Cool thanks
Yeah I want profit on my options I dont have shares
didn't wanna take the chance with automod lol
Open your drawer.
Its brad
Just cuz ur losing money....doesnt mean shit.
I think algos are a little more complex than "no headlines = dump all day".
Sometimes you just gotta go with the flow.
Oof. Thankfully Im one of those people that can go months without seeing anyone, then be in a room full of people and be okay, so long as I know at least a few of them. 

Its definitely difficult. I started baking sourdough 14 months ago before COVID hit and launched a small baked goods biz from my apartment. That, video games, WSB, my wife and kiddo, are my hobbies now.
Remindme! To not be 27, unemployed, and whining to 20 year olds about being lonely In a gambling sub.

Life will pick up soon after the vax distributions tho bro
Fuck nkla
I dont have an exit target right now but there was a lot of unusual option activity on the weeks leading up. Just realized theres earnings on Thursday but Im in Feb and May 45s
It may go lower. Not entirely sure with warrants and potential pipe selling. After that sorts itself out it will be less volatile.
Yeah idk. Had a good run. Probably going to shake all the fast money out and melt up for the next couple of years as pltr quietly embeds itself in every corporation and nato allied government
3 years? Damn that's a long time. Would still be a good idea to get in now and exit at 2.5 years.
Dude - thanks for the time. Im learning in a poor way but Im learning. Just feel so dumb.
Im not the one with the will to write. So I dont give a shit? Get fukt nerd.
That's a fair assessment. You do you boo. I wish you the best in your efforts to retire early!
What bill?
Was not referring to that. They still got to do some climbing delivery number wise but diamond hand it long term and you will be alright. Tesla and Nio are the best EVs no questions about it.
You do realize that the actual unemployment is like 20% right?   That there are bread lines in every state. That people won't be gathering as much.
Okay Im convinced
More like money = girls
Ever heard of Joe Biden??
10c I mean, BB 10c, well see how the iv is though, might just day trade it if its too high
nice gains, whats your target price?
Heyheyhey - good bye NKLA
Ok thanks
Oh shit, its true.

$21.82 it is!
Lol "new month new lows". Imagine using this logic to make decisions
I dunno who Max Pain is but aint nobody losing money in here today
lmao
though I'll admit I feel you on the unmarried thing. It's not that unmarried people get fucked, it's that married people are assumed to have more to "take care of" so they benefit as a result. Same stats apply to fat people.

&#x200B;

I recommend either getting fat, or faking an engagement if you're not toooo close with your coworkers. Fake an engagement. Get the raise/promotion- then leverage it into a new job where it's okay to be single again lmao
bruh you gotta stop victimizing yourself. Work is just as much politics as it is effort. Your comp is directly tied to how much your manager likes you and how much value you bring. you gotta suck the corporate d and stroke the balls amigo
lmao this is actually hilarious.
annnnd this is why these policies exist. As a hedge against backwards assholery like this. From a purely financial standpoint- there are figures to support the idea as well. Firms with a minority/female representation on the board perform better.

&#x200B;

aside from that: your comment is predicated on the idea that there are no women and minority men qualified to be board members and that any who are placed are placed in favor of a more qualified white guy. This is literally the reason these policies exist. The very assumption you made is the fucked up part that makes these rules important. 

&#x200B;

I'm sure if it were the early 1900s you'd be saying something about how it's a disgrace that any black man be admitted to harvard. *lest they take the place of a white man! WE ARE THE VICTIMMMMS REEEEEEEEEEEEE*
So currently 75% of boards do not comply.

"To say you must pick candidate X over candidate Y because of their gender, sexual orientation, skin color, etc is wrong on many levels."

Do you think those boards are comprised of people that are all more qualified and have more merit then the blacks/gays/LGBTQ community?

Or perhaps maybe there are some systemic problems in this country that this regulation is attempting to address?
Wtf does being Single have to do with it LOL
Agree. As a woman, I DO want women to succeed and lead, but only when it is deserved. We will never cut through the misogyny if people think women have achieved undeserved success.
I agree the incentive approach would be better. Boards are pretty much a rubber stamp fest anyways. I'll get my pitch fork if c-level rules come in.  Mandating forces the door open, especially when most boards are full of the same people over and over again.
Weak. I have a courier drop off my trades directly to Mr Schwab
That is preposterous
No you have your animals mixed up.  Bear = shit in the woods.  Gay Bear = buy puts, lose money, and suck dongs.
If somethings run don't fomo. It might run more, it might not, but accept you missed the play and move on. You're paying too much for iv at this point let her go
Are we looking at the same stock? [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE/)
It's not confirmed yet right? CRM earnings call today as well
Got a couple of 120c expiring Friday so I hope it doesn't shit the bed before then lol
Are you me? We would be best friends
blue pills been makin me moneyz so ya
It is doimg a terrible job cuz i still have no clue what ticker it has
Yeah exactly! Theyre just getting through the filters cuz its not catching SUN as a ticker
You must be new here. Nobody gives a fuck unless its at least 100% minimum. Wait til you hear about 10 baggers
Yes
i dunno man im just saying what I read earlier. The amazon hype is silly in my opinion
Exactly. Everyone else just cares about making money.
Good luck!
zoomers going all in tech stocks
Its up a percent premarket.
Still not happening.
I know nothing about trading, literally just buy low sell high... and this thread is confusing me. Why is everyone jumping on things that are already swinging up?
when is the vote? haven't found the info yet..
It would be worth more than Facebook at this price. LOL
Tendies make me thirsty
No that was Elon Zuckerberg
50 and i shit in some guys mouth and he does!
I also can't afford to eat.
Lol I realize that my comment just boils down to "buy low sell high," but that's exactly what I did yesterday. I was holding a few 12/11 40c, then dumped them and took my 60% gains and bought back in closer to strike price when it dumped.
Lol he has 160k in Robinhood and we are supposed to be jealous of his intellect 
Big institutions
yep they will go back up eventually, its just dead money rn
nope weeklies
Its ok bro, my life savings are safe, I only gamble what I can afford to lose unlike some people around here. Still suck tho
Let me know where to send the log
Ya know what, I kinda respect that but I hope you're wrong :)
Oh thank you for the necessary. My finger slipped and bought MRNA calls instead.
And yet this whole sub was pumping it like it was pumping pltr
I dont know what I expected to get for that question but Im in
I will follow this method. What I eat for lunch everyday will now depend on what one share of PLTR is going for. 
$25/share= Penne ala vodka delivered 
$9/share = Driving to pick up some Wendys
Lmao come on man you have to act way more autistic so I know its a joke
Oh gawd NVAX up 7% already, bout to 
(   )
Yass.. how many inch?
They have government contracts man. Theyre going to recover. Institutional ownership is like <20%. Tesla is like 44% or something. I plan on holding this for years. Wasnt a swing trade for me
We want to see the gains, not the shrimp cocktail.
 hold it
You got this my dude, hold yourself to that plan
I got mine for the 11th! Next hour he will be dumping more so get in
Just diamond hand it. If NIO kicks back up, then it'll drag all the other chinese EVs up with it from the grave
Thank you for your service.
Youd think that but look at todays gains... all off them submitting European request news. Everyone says its priced in until the news comes out, same with Tesla split priced in
This is true
The eternal
Meme stocks
5% for Pfizer is a huge deal and thats what it was up today just off news of request for approval. Im no genius at this but this is a play Ive put a lot of time into researching and Ive been trapped into the PLTR wave and NIO so this is definitely a play I can go to bed not terrified Im going to wake up and be down 100% on my options. Just trying to let others know to look into it, not trying to get a pump or anything
I have a number of them: $595 12/04, $590 12/04, $585 12/24, $590 12/31,  $595 01/08
Lmao, I can see them now ascending from the heavens spreading destruction. I figure NIO is the horseman of famine lol.
Nah, not holding any puts. I know I sound bearish but I see troubled waters, I avoid them. They may have 3 years to comply but I'm worried for weekly NIO holders
Just heard some whispers, should read up on it actually
I should of walked away WED - got greedy & burned at this point with the IV - feel retarded - they deserve my money
Lol. 780% past 12 months, how the fuck is '21 gonna be the "breakout year"?
Woah dude no way. Gains take time, be patient! Log off and look after yourself if you have to.

Look at it in 6 months.....

Take care
You have a point. If it drops again tomorrow I'm probably selling at market open Thursday still making a little bit of profit overall... Just much less than I had hoped.
Started investing this month, it was around $13 when i first see it and watch couple days first
$9.35 gang here. Happy to take shares at 20
I wasnt trying to be a smart ass. I agree with you and find it funny as well. Was just riffing off your premise
the price bot literally said IV 250%

It means the options are going to lose value just because theres so much volatility. Calls and puts are going down in value just because of uncertainty. You're losing money just because you own it. The only thing that can save you is an insane dildo. At least the exp date is far, so theta wont kill it yet, but you're not gonna make any money if it trades sideways till exp
That's my issue is that it's so volatile that it can swing by a couple hundred dollars in seconds and you could get lucky with a higher limit order. You also could miss your chance to maximize profits and watch it miss your order then dip...
Lol. I never even got the chance to sell
Whats the high?
Godspeed, retard.

I sold so get ready for a fucking spike.
Agreed. Im new to options but Im in. If it drops to 365 im exercising it or should i just hold till 12/04
I guess haha. Thanks!
I think the 34 is toast - you can wait until we run up a little and roll it out or simply sell it.

I would keep the 12/11 24c and cash it out on the uptick in the next few days. 

It's my opinion, not financial advice ;-)
Hmm sounds like ur short
so you are smart
Was news last night out of the UK. They are using it for their Visas. And HHS is requiring hospitals to use them. Almost 3% AH it could start moving again.
So I should hold then 
tbf it hit $24 yesterday so itd have to dip like 15% from its premarket level, plus I cant bet, I have no buying power
I meant Im not looking for outside donations. Just love dogs
yeah you right
Nah he's actually solid as hell if your timeframe is longer than a week.

Like any stock resource, be skeptical of everything. But the boomer effect alone sets up tons of good Cramer plays
Hey so why shares? I wanna hop in
Thanks for the insight. I think Im sold. Godspeed my dude
I think Im sold, and Ill probably get the digital version. Appreciate the feedback. Godspeed dude
Undervalued - you talking about NIO or PLTR?
That escalated quickly
Nailed it! 
I like your perspective lol
If you have ever been burned by a ticker you will always remember. I wanted to play BB today and missed out on money but I barely got out with some gains on that before. I do think there is potential in GME though.
Well, the main two are the Moderna and the Pfizer ones, both of which are based on mRNA. No widely-used vaccine before has used mRNA. The other promising vaccines such as the Oxford vaccine is still in stage2 trials as far as I am aware, so yeah.
Somehow I dont think putting twice my homes value up for collateral is a great idea, but maybe Ill be there someday.
If you know tech well, I say stick with it. Tech is the future anyway.
I may take you up on that. Thanks.
Yeah Im just tryna use my day trades to cash out on it today once it rebounds... PLTR is not a good look long term
That has really nothing to do with data analytics friend. PLTR is a data analytics company. You are simply targeting about a rocket targeting someone.
your hands made of tissue?
so thats literally what he said

its either gonna go up, down, or sideways
I sold half of mine at around 6 as well.. if senate turns around will moon for sure
Im here to make money, not trust
Mate youre a really nice guy. Thanks man. I hope you get tendies today too
I was about to say. Be careful with those nakeds
I see it on merril. Yeah thats a true penny stock lol
I would hold weeklies through earnings. (12/11)
House decision tomorrow. DOA in Senate getting priced in.
Thanks for the insight! I'm loading up on Jan 15 $480c and I'll cut my losses if it ends up trending down.
ideally yeah but these fkn boomers just sell everything when they hit +5%, they're the real retxards
Im like 20% winrate playing the SPY, I mostly try puts though and  I  am learning that algos are strongly against bears. This looks like a top though
I cant answer the trend question. However I do agree that they need to not fight over table scraps and find their market niche
TSLA $600c bottomed at $11.00 & is back around $16.00 now. Free money.
I am long to
Shares and Options.
130 common shares.
10 x 15c 12/18 in case it pops after merger.
5 x 15c 5/21/21 for the slow burn
Look man all I'm saying is when we're at/near ATH and the greed index is pinging the top it doesn't hurt to have some way OTM puts in case some stupid shit comes out of left field.  I'm still stacked with calls but I don't want to get wiped out on a random 5% day that tends to happen when everyone is overleveraged long.
Most of that money will. None of that $908 is going to the people who actually spend it on sustenance. That PPP shit is the biggest scheme in history.
So you just bled 50% of your gains in the past 2 days but you're happy to take single digit gains on GME.  When the play from the beginning on GME was stocks and hold for a squeeze, or long calls.  Got it.
Just hold
Its sideways right now though? I dont see the potential
Yep, Im not selling til its down 50% or green
But memes make money :(
Yes sir
Lock up period is 180 days from IPO bruv
I'm not sure, I'm not from the US so I don't know the specific legalities around doing that.
Good call. You can still blend any interest or passion you have for healthcare/science and see it from a financial lens. Masters of Econ usually run about a year of study IIRC. 

If you can get into biopharm company that will support your CPA training, you could do that as well. Don't expect big pay when articling though.
I find issue with the concept of trying to find qualified people from certain categories when it should be on 100% qualifications alone. Its like, actively against its own initial purpose of equality. Nobody should get or be denied a position based on the color of their skin or what genitals they have, period.
I'm being satirical you autist
Has nothing to do with not supporting the market. In that case Congress has never supported the market unless they were authorizing for billions to be printed and injected. You do realize that almost 400 billion of the stimulus for the market was never used?
yes and it was when SPY hit ATH for 364 and dropped about 3 points which is a pretty steep downtrend. 365 -> 354
Fuck you beat me, i cant win when china makes up random numbers
Im joking too fellow autist. Im joking too. Good luck today my son 
Never forget that I told you that it would fall off the open there my friend
I see a stock on it's way down, I dont buy. I keep my money and put it into options that look like they'll go up. Simple really.
Could care less tbh I'm averaging 100% gains on shares this year
might be due to interest rates being so low & them being a mortgage company? 

not sure entirely but Im really long-term bullish on em so im trying to get as many shares as I can afford lol
Thanks
Most likely
CRSR Ive been on thiccb since like 10ish
Nope not smarter I'm a tard, freakin vanguard bought the shares at $122!!! Wtf???

Edit. I'm a dumbass i actually got in at $120 a share
Lmao thats how I felt yesterday
Thanks
FD
Well I hope it pushes the rest of the day
Not really the crux of my argument, just speculating on the prevailing crowd sentiment and saying its unbased
much much better! i like docu but idk if itll dominate the sector. i dont think they got enough moat
Doesn't North korean's dictatorship have democratic in their party's name? Lol I hardly think names mean anything more than their origins
Because of their socialist governing body wtf. When we invest in their companies we give the people more money to leverage over their government. Thats why its a fuck you to them
Yea its on almost all major banks.
I may just do that. Its with ground coffee, yea?
I misread that you downgraded it from hold to buy, hence the confusion
Merger just wait and see my brother
I have 2 and a 3rd freed up on friday. We will see how this goes
Two of my last three matches said theyve started investing/trading now
We all dumb, but together, we're stupid.
You're missing the point and the tendies
Exactly. Still a good long play imo, but its going to consolidate for a while now. Find a new bass before the next big leg up. People who want a meme stock or have a ton of weeklys need to move on or loose everything
True I know you're right. It just seems like it keeps getting worse and worse.
Too late to hop on then imo
I already pay taxes on my 401k funds upon entry, so does that mean this rollover you speak of is easier?

Already a ROTH
jesus. im in dec 31 3300c :)

GME going to zero baby
no one talks about this as a viable option. Thats why Im saying the teachers are complicit. Its not that those arent great jobs (because they are) but most students dont even consider/know about them before they are swamped with debt
that only forgives *federal* loans after 10 years of payments
because if we are talking about supporting an economy then thats a better use of taxpayer money. People free from debt are more likely to spend money going forward. Restaurants getting money just to stay alive does nothing for the economy because the virus is still keeping people and revenue away. 

It is literally impossible to have student loans forgiven. Even if you die, you or your relatives still owe. And 200k in debt is almost insurmountable for years and years if your industry starts you out ~40k
haha bro I feel ya on the stupid degrees but just from personal experience, truly, the only degree worth the debt is engineering. And some people just dont care about engineering haha

Also, you have to recognize that it is almost impossible to work your way through college anymore. My parents did it and paid everything off before they even graduated. Kids today could work 40 hours a week and still have 10-15k of tuition left to pay each semester. Its a bloated, predatory system. 

They are scalping education to people that think they need it
that used to be true 20-40 years ago when our parents grew up. Now going to college is a scam.
Its much less expensive to bail out the students than the restaurants. Thats my whole point. 

Also, I would rather have an economy of young people without mental health problems doing jobs they love and working in the industry they went to school for INSTEAD of a bunch of restaurant workers paying back the banks  (I worked in a restaurant for 5 years)
Thats not even true? They also just bought sweet water 420. Which if youve ever been to Atlanta, is a very dank beer
Thanks for the info dawg. 
Thanks!
When the hell did that happen
Rotten tomatoes search for best Netflix shows. Just cause they make a bunch of shit that gets rated between 50-70% they have a ton of killers at 95% that are Netflix originals. Mark Netflix price and set a reminder in your phone calendar for 10 years from now. See if you account outperformed Netflix from this day to 10 years from now. If I knew you I would bet $1000 that you would lose to their return. There are 5 billion possible Netflix subscribers and that number keeps growing. They only have 200 million right now. They will be number one streaming provider. They replaced the term TV
I read it. Whats your EOD prediction?
Ill let you in on a secret, the market doesnt actually like the next leader of the free world.
Yeah just now up 110%
Whos buying planes right now?
Fuck it im YOLOing WORK 12/4 calls
Better do
oh i know brother, got my XOM and GM options mooning at this point
But will there be any good news?
That is not exactly correct sir. The extension will go through this week and the DA can be announced the day after. If it pops on that I will sell, no need to baghold. Got my stop anyways on warrants, and shares at $10.30.
which may or may not happen in three years... why would one want to pull out so early
Yup, was one of their primary customers
Yeah same here, I went for feb calls because earnings is usually good for BABA (except the most recent one because of all the other shit going on).
Well the stock is at any rate.
That makes perfect sense, thank you for that hahah.
They next Q will be great but I am spooked, maybe I will just stay away. I just hate missing big ZM movement
I mean that works as long as someone brings the price back up again before market open.. But if anyone sees NKLA drop 7% AH or PM these days its not going to seen as a healthy correction.

Ahh man. Youre young. Wait till youre dead inside. I made 20k this week and feel nothing. 

But yea hype for vaccine.
Ah, a man of culture
Honestly, 2.5 year for me is a long term investment. Just do your homework and pay attention to the autists on this sub lol
No problem my brother. Making mistakes means you are trying, as long as you learn from your mistakes and from others mistakes lol
Already there brother!
People in the US are conditioned to mindlessly consume. Go to a shopping  mall. You'll see the most low income disadvantaged people spending hundreds on nikes, gucci bags, gaming systems, ect.
Check that premarket volume bro. Who tf is buying this ghost? Dont want my bulls to lose money
Im betting on the GOP holding the senate and absolutely nothing being able to be legislated for the next two years.
There is no logic around these parts. We are all bullshitting.
Fake it till you make it. Lmao. Ill marry a gay guy double points lol.
Find where it shows I predicated anything about there being no women or minority men being qualified to be board members. You wont because I havent said such thing. Ive said that its about picking the best available person regardless of their race or gender. Im a minority myself reeeeeeeeee
Explain to me what benefit a women brings to a company over a man, all else being equal. Explain to me what benefit a LGBTQ member brings to a company over a straight person, all else being equal. 

Sugar coat however you need to in order for your reasoning to fit the narrative.

They want people supporting families to get the pay bumps  its true  and they will also ask single workers to stay late or come in more
Yes. I said I bought it as \~$40, now its$39

Ha youre probably good. I have $110 1/15/2021 so I have time to hold for a bit if I need to. Not holding too long unless something crazy happens
Men are pretty one-dimensional when you think about it. I can get along with 80% of us.

Well its happening again I guess. Too bad my 1/15 39c have lost 50% of their value 
I didnt know this sub had such high rollers to scoff at 140k profits in a month, sorry my Robinhood money must be fake
I don't understand what you're saying man
Well then yeah maybe cut your losses but I still believe that there is huge upside so if you can try opening some calls for 1/15 or april
Glad to hear, I'm in for shares and at least a year. Pretty confident there is a long term play here.
Just get out if you can, I dont have puts on PLTR. I'm not holding any puts against nor am I planning on buying. Literally saying this stuff to save bulls' tendies. Theres plenty of other action around the market but PLTR losing its meme momentum and alot of people are going to get dragged down by it
"They're a scam obviously, they'll go down after selling their 7 billion vaccinations."
ya but PLTR is an actual good stonk, cyber defense and intel company with oversight and funding from cia
That's the spirit!
That's a solid strategy. What do you get from Wendy's though?
we are all hurting rn

All about volume on TSLA tbh. heavy volume on a buy candle means you can up the price on your limits. low volume on any TSLA candle means get tf out!

I usually dont hold things for very long, try to cash out when I hit a 30% profit. Sometimes I miss out on huge gains that way, but Ive missed out on some huge losses, too. Gonna hold these puts until it hits $364, I think.
It keeps going down bro - its gonna hit 40!!!

Speaking into existence for all my fellow retards, I cant be the only one. Lost my ass on a meme - gotta love it
Hey bro, thats all I can ask for. Fingers crossed on your strategy because I was gonna bag hold regardless
Also - can you please explain rolling it out - my goal is to hopefully make some money on PLTR bouncing up and cut my losses on the 34 call the best I can - hopefully the 24 call potential profit will cover it - god I went full retard - I dont deserve the cash!!
yep, made a ton shorting from $19

Yikes not looking good. This gonna dip some more
I almost snagged some at 25
Again, he has historically underperformed the S&P. I dont know what to tell you.

Good choice. I think Williams Sonoma has the best deals especially if you pick up a credit card through them.

But for real, Im an aviation meteorologist, DM me when you take lessons and I can help you with the weather portion.
Thats whats happening. The big boys have us and we have those morons. Once theres no more buyers well come back down and those idiots will be underwater from buying the top.
Hey considering the sub I wouldnt past some people here lmao
Not a good look long term? I disagree
I'm responding to the part you *emphasized* because it's an obvious embellishment. I have 2,000 shares of PLTR from day one and I'm also telling you nobody was doing that shit by hand even 10 years ago, unless it was a laminated map in their pocket. Satellites and data analytics have existed for a long time. Does PLTR do it better? Yes, depending on the need. But were we fighting wars like cave people before Peter Thiel came along? Nah bud

Still an interesting company to follow for sure - ya might be able to find some good forward looking / industry trend date in their 10-K filings
I only have a few hundred and was thinking about getting calls
rent, food, clothes - whatever they buy will end up back in real assets.
I know it might be hard for your to comprehend, but this is a stock I plan on holding long term. There will be red days, Im not worried
Ripping up
You gotta be in it before you see it retard
Because there is a systemic bias for white males. Non white male demographic don't play on the same level playing field. Affirmative action is put in place to bring the descriminated group up to a level playing field. We cannot have a proper competition if the field isn't level.
Yah I know. Thats not gonna move the market at all unless they reallocate it, and in that case its bullish. I dont see what your point is unless your saying were gonna pump on this news.
China has declared USA has declared China is #1
I dont even think you know what youre talking about at this point lmao. Which ticker am I holding? How much money did I lose? Or did I gain?  Seek therapy friend.
Nice
I bought at high yesterday too. Hold for 30 minutes and youll be green
A pretty simple rule is just because a stock was a certain price a few weeks ago doesnt mean itll go there again very quickly. Id Exit that position at break even or minimal profit if you can, theta is gonna eat your soul. But I wish you the best, anything is possible. This is a casino after all
I mean they have a choice between the party or death, so that's democratic, right?
Not sure what is more retarded, thinking China had/has a socialist type of governance or not being aware of chinas backing of capitalism for the past 30 + years
yes! i go the extra mile and grind my beans in the morning because i think it makes the coffee much bolder
Yeah that was a weird sentence by me. My bad.
Fuck it i'm in. If i get burned by another penny stock i'll learn my lesson this time...maybe
Yiiikes
Runescape it is
It has good meme potential
I havent done that but I would think so! Id call up the customer service at your 401k company and tell them youve already paid taxes on it and want direct control. They can at least guide you on process before you shop around to look at other brokers.
Yeah youre good lol

Well how much loans do we want to forgive here?

I seriously dont get how people are racking up that much student loans unless they are working on a graduate degree.
Why not just join the military or work for the government and utilize PSLF? 

And also Im pretty sure students loans are automatically forgiven after 25 years...Im not sure where youre getting your info from but it is not correct.
You arent supposed to pay off college with a job at McDonalds man you pay it off with the career income you make from your degree. Being a doctor is a lot of debt but you clear it in the first to second year. Being a nurse is less debt and also clear it in 1-2 years. Me I went to trade school and make close to 6 figures with no debt. People are always going to make dumb decisions I know I did a lot but I was responsible for fixing it and I did nobody saved me so why I got to pitch in for jakes art degree
Its always the poor college kids shit. Cant stand it. Im so glad I didnt go down that route and choose that way of life. Half the morons I went to highschool with are just now getting out with 200k in debt because they just had to go to a big name college to suck some frat dick, not to mention most came back with drug and alcohol addictions. They Probably dont even know what a 10mm socket is, but hey, they got their degree in underwater basket weaving!
I beg to differ: https://ycharts.com/companies/APHA/free_cash_flow

you must be talking about adjusted ebitda which is useless.  cash flow is where it's at and they've been negative for years!
i have no idea, i bought 100 shares to ride, see where it takes me
Priced in
Good shit
Definitely not as many as before COVID, but the backlog for the MAX is still in the thousands. An order for a plane is usually made years in advance. So, forward looking airlines (i.e. those that know they will make it through the downturn) will still have a need to upgrade their fleets.
Good man, dont use all your cash, try getting some! :)
Not sure about that.
Yes, the extension will most likely go through during the vote and it will probably rip upon announcement. If you intend to sell then, you're fine. Might be the last chance to get out unless you wanna baghold for months.
People in it for a quick buck. Not everyone buys for 3-5 years out.

So what does TikTok have to with NET?
Doesn't matter, if you know you're selling at a loss anyways it's about keeping the loss to a minimum.

Trickle your sales in 10-100k at a time when volume is low and it might cause a 20% drop. Try that during trading hours and you could cause a 50% slide as limit stops start cascading.
Damn it.

Not sure if I'm jealous or that you're old! Hah.

Kidding aside. Enjoy it!
lmao I now pronounce you chuck and larry style.
in the context, " Whoevers best for the position should be there regardless of race or gender." is a statement made in rebuttal to what is essentially the main point of "companies should be required to fill board seats with qualified minority men and women." Stating that the basis of hiring should be quals, negates the assumption that firms intend to only hire qualified people. 

&#x200B;

It is, from a debate standpoint, most certainly predicated on the idea that to fill these positions with minority representation would inherently disqualify candidates who are qualified but outside the realm of "minority."

&#x200B;

"Im A mInOrItY" ---- so you're what? asian? 1/16th native american? (lol), 1/8th cuban? hit me baby.
No your right I get it, women and LGBTQ people just need to work harder and then they will be 75% of boards.

I'm with ya.

Good luck man! After this week of course haha. Cheers
thanks
You can rationalize anything and any stonk
Crispy chicken sandwich meal every time
What? We are fine. I have limit sell order.   $188/share for 2K share. If this happen. Lol I will take a lot trading course and quit my job. Wait. I dont have a job now.
Good idea. If I do have to fomo into something it is to sell roughly 10-15 minutes later. Did it with SNAP and PINS with incredible success.
I think people really dont understand how huge a self driving big rig is with 600 mile range. Its going to be so disruptive to the trucking industry. TSLA is going to make so much money.
I cant help but picture Alex Karp with his little glasses showing off an xcel macro to the US army brass or the UK government and hearing an audible gasp from them when they realize how much time it saves. Then immediately offering him blank check
Better to take the profit than risk it. How many puts did you get?
It means using the value in the option to trade it for one in the future that you think is more likely to hit - hit up Youtube and "rolling out" and you'll find a few videos talking about it.
Based on?
You mean its a safer bet right lol
You will kick yourself when it goes back up :(
just because you have crayons doesnt mean youre special
I didn't consider that. I'll have to look at some past 10-k's. Thanks. I feel like they got the short end of the stick because they pay dividens and cut them due to covid. And then their price tanked.
If it dips between now and the 8th Im buying up to 170 additional shares, but Im not adding to my options positions
I totally understand the plan to hold long term.  I don't necessarily disagree with you.  But to have that bullish an outlook on PLTR with what it has been doing, and then to sell GME after a couple days, those two don't align.
Why the fuck you lyin
Yeah exactly. Hence why Im saying its too late
Seek therapy for you trolling when I was telling people to not buy weeklies because we are over extended up and the upside was small if not much. Seems like you got something going on in your personal life
ay man ... Im not paper handing again unless it hits like 35 but
Ok lmao, take my upvote for making me genuinely chuckle. That's a good one
If they're so capitalist is that why there are so many state owned companies there?
Id say its already maxed out its potential, but maybe
hopefully we both print brother. diamond hands
Im not saying there arent ways to avoid debt. Im saying there is already this huge fucking problem that can help a lot more people if we solve, instead of shoveling money at a shit business model.
I get it, no one gave you a handout so you dont want to feel like other people got a handout. I feel the same way, but I know that freeing that debt would help a lot of young people that have serious mental health issues because of it.
Im just stating reality. Drowning in debt is not good for mental or economic health of young people. We can blame them and berate them, or we can help them.
Is it to late for me to hop in? Lmao
Love it
I hope so, we still need BA for our local economy. Not as much as we needed it 25yrs ago with AMZN, MSFT, COST, TMUS, etc. as backstops.
Why do you say hold then? I'm losing massive value every day because its 200C
Its 2020 dude, there are such things as stops and limits. I got in 2 min after the og DD was posted so not worried at all. Small position compared to others here
TY! Good luck to all fellow retards today and every day.
Some people are more qualified than others. Literally whoever is best pick them. Dont pick someone less qualified but still meets your bare minimum criteria because theyre a certain race or gender. 

And wtf Im definitely a minority. Not half ,quarter ,or some sort of fraction. Full. Im not responding to the question further because its bigoted.
Ha definitely lets hope we both make it out on top
you literally dont get it, they are the cutting edge and they are a government stonk. if you fucked up thats cuz your retarded
Lol i used to love Cripsy Chicken sandwiches but now I just feel gross after eating them. Try the grilled!
Only two, unfortunately. The rest of my account is in Apple 1/11 $130cs right now or I would have bought more
Another question overchipped - is there a certain point of no return on these trades - they are both not officially in the red - my inexperience is telling me Monday / Tuesday are my last realistic days to sell off
You got it 
What if it doesn't though?
Hahahah. Tell that to my account. I was telling the boy how to read my chart.
Shares huh, sounds alright
I get what youre saying, but for me GME was always going to be a quick trade based on hype. I dont necessarily buy the narrative of the short squeeze
Open your eyes. 1180 > 1199

I mean restaurants provide jobs to people, and its not just restaurants that are struggling and need money. Youre presenting a false dilemma fallacy here. 

What does a college student without debt provide to the economy? Nothing unless they are either employed or start a business.

I understand that student loan debts are a problem. But Id once again point towards ways that individuals can give their service in exchange for loan repayment. This is a concept even brought by Biden (public service in exchange for 10k a year in debt relief).
Listen I think college should be free. I also think it would be nice if we all had lambos. The world is cruel and brutal and its futile to try and coddle anyone or anything through it. There are btw many debt forgiveness plans for college kids
Well I can say you are probably right with all this, but I dont think we should say fuck the hospitality sector and bail out college kids. Im not even saying this as a joke, but the college kids seriously need the hospitality sector to stay afloat, or their debt will be the last thing they are worried about
I have the 200c as well. Sold half when it hit 185 and letting the rest ride. They have absolutely killed earnings so probably getting pinned or consolidating now. I'm holding them through - worst case I break even. You've to decide whether you want to cut losses or ride it out
That's nice! The use of stoplosses for us Swedes buying on the US market is really questionable... It's good that you are aware of news and the risks at least, so you don't YOLO and lose it all.
you right that was a fucked up question but there's a fuckton of fake shills here pushing agendas. I apologize nonetheless- it was wrong to suggest on my part and I should take your word with some faith since you seem to be dealing in good faith yourself. 

&#x200B;

With that said, you're not wrong bro. Qualified is important for sure. I don't think anyone wants to force hands at recruiting unqualified individuals. Qualified, but underrepresented is the aim. Not a usurping of the corporate meritocracy. I think that's both fair, and important. If you disagree with the premise entirely, that's fair too. I just wanted to clarify that conceptually, the idea isnt unqualified folks getting hand held and led into leadership roles, but rather qualified folks who otherwise would not be selected (for whatever reason) being selected instead (but qualified lol).
Lol ok
jpow and friends are currently discussing grants for restaurants. Thats why I brought it up. all Im saying is the liability outweighs the lesson that any of these college grads might learn.

And are you serious? More expendable income without a $700 a month *minimum* student loan payment is a huge boost to spending within the economy, which supports everyone and everything. Allows 20-30 year olds to save money, buy houses, start families, etc. and like I said, most of these loans are not forgivable. its a cancer
I dont think anyone should get a bailout. Im a libertarian through and through. my entire argument was that if we are gonna give money to restaurant owners it should instead go to students.
its the same thing with airlines. Why tf should we bail out a system with terrible margins, when the problem facing the industry (covid) is not yet solved? There has to be some risk that you assume as a business owner. 

My whole argument is that if we are gonna bail *anyone* out, it should be the students that were unaware of the true amount of debt they were signing up for.
Thanks! And How come?
Thank you. Really was offended for a second. 

I just really believe that whoever is best fit for a position should have it. I hate when minorities get treated as lessors that need accommodations to compete with their counterparts. For instance, Satya Nadella earned his position at Microsoft all on merit and is making Steve Ballmer look like an incompetent tool with each second of the day.
700/month is like 60k in student loans. Not sure thats a majority of borrowers. And if those are private loans than yah that sucks. But there should be some service given in exchange for repayment at the least. Not outright forgiveness.
I think it should go to both as long as we are out here doing charity. I struggle to see how instead of giving money to the employment opportunities the college kids need to earn wages for their debts that going straight to the college kids and letting franks subway store close down is the way to go
I get your argument, but Im not convinced they didnt know what they were signing up for. Its kind of like the 2008 financial crisis with the banks, they knew what they were doing, they just didnt give a shit cause they were confident one way or another they will be bailed out
Not sure if it's due to the delay we have of 15 minutes or why but it has rarely hit the mark in the instaces I've been using it. It is also a hassle to set it up when buying on the phone.
again, I apologize. Genuinely inappropriate. 

dude i feel you- im a minority myself. In some environments it's just necessary. I worked in finance/banking as an intern and I got treated like scum. Minority male, funky name, obviously not a christian, didn't appear to be from a wealthy blueblood family, state school, etc. They sometimes literally humiliated me without even realizing it. An MD literally said "I'm surprised you were even hired here. If it were up to me we wouldn't give students from your uni the time of day." He wasnt even fucking American! lol

I can see instances where this could run afoul but I would hesitate to characterize them as commonplace. Surely there should be adjudication/fairness standards and mechanisms in place as well- it doesnt have to be cut and dry. 

I have just realized that no matter how well I do on my own, the assumption is always that I'm a diversity hire or got lucky or something. With everything in my life. I'm not a victim and don't see myself as one, but I know the system as it stands wasnt designed for me to succeed and the human infrastructure that lines it sees me as more of a "******* that doesnt know his place" kinda thing. I love that you think the cards are in your hands to play them as you see fit, but don't get it twisted thinking that you were supposed to be playing at the table. props to you nonetheless though.
I actually advocate for required military service in order to be able to vote, so I agree it shouldnt just be a free handout. but there are *so* many kids in debt that idk what you could actually require of them in order to qualify for forgiveness. Maybe you could make it that they cant leave the country for 10 years so they have to work here.
Most people do t work at restaurants because that was their dream. Most people work there to get by. I think you could help peoples mental health if you freed them from debt and allowed them to take the 20k a year art job that they would rather do. I think the cost of a generation or two struggling with mental health outweighs paying for some underwater basket weaving degrees. 

That said, I still dont think anyone deserves a handout. Just gotta figure out how to stop the predatory system in place
have you met an 18 year old recently? lol they are insanely inept lmao.
Its fine. You apologized already brother.

And it sucks you had to go through that man. But everyones not like that. Theres assholes in this world sure but karma has a funny way of dealing with those fucks for us. Best we can do is ignore them and go on about our aspirations. 

And yeah thats also another aspect of why Im against essentially affirmative action in corporate leadership. It doesnt feel rewarding knowing that your accomplishments may not have been fully earned on your own merit. Its like when they give out participation trophies in sports. Like cool, I know I didnt win ,but go ahead and try to make me feel like one anyway just to not hurt my feelings. And in turn, make me feel like Ill always be a loser and dont have what it takes to be a winner. Yeah I resent that kind of treatment.
Well like I said I believe Biden has a plan regarding student loans that involves some form of public service for 10k a year in forgiveness. Whether it sees the light of day is another thing.
I feel like the problem isnt centered at the debt. Its institutional. Look at rent vs wages cost of living is really whats destroying everyone. I hope to see the utopia just as much as you and it is predatory but the current system is designed that way.
Lol unfortunately I have. I hope this college scam thing becomes obsolete one day. Its creating a generation of fucking retards that have degrees saying they know how to use Microsoft office. Unfortunately Microsoft office doesnt build houses, manufacture cars, or maintain power lines and power plants. I think we are big time fucked in the next 20 years or so, and unfortunately its my generation/ age group that will be at blame
fair enough actually- I appreciate the insight into your POV. I'll do some thinking on this myself. I agree with a lot of the sentiment there also.
lol govt broke our legs and is now *thinking* about handing us a crutch to walk on. what a world lol
it all starts with the governments good intentions backfiring. Guaranteeing student loans to banks made it possible for universities to get in bed with the banks and inflate the price. This is true of many industries today. Govt involvement backfired and prices shoot up as a result. 

Look at the two most expensive industries: education and healthcare. What do they have in common? Massive govt involvement
nah see I dont blame parents doing and saying they want what (they thought) was best for their kids. I blame the govt for guaranteeing student loans, thus allowing universities to inflate tuition endlessly
but yes, we need manufacturing back badly.
Stay positive man and have a good day! Make some tendies .
Well maybe college isnt actually necessary for everyone in the first place. A lot of people can get perfectly well paying careers through vocational training.
I think its on purpose. We are all cattle to our overlords. Good little debt slaves
you too brotha have a great one
yeah thats true, but that gets back to the teachers being complicit in all of this. People honestly dont know about the other opportunities out their that pay well. They think they will be a failure if they dont go to college.
yup. If the masses are empowered, they are dangerous to the ruling class
Thats definitely true. Hell you can go straight from high school into the army as helicopter pilot making 60k a year. And then be able to make a ton more as a civilian. While also having the GI bill for free college.

They never told me that in high school.
exactly because they arent incentivized to. teachers/academia have never had real jobs so they think people have to follow in their footsteps with more school. People just dont know how to make decisions for themselves, let alone where to find other opportunities
